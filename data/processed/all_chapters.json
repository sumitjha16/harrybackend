Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursle y\u2019s sister, but they hadn\u2019t met \nfor several years; in fact, Mrs. Du rsley pretended she didn\u2019t have a \nsister, because her sister and her good-for-nothing husband were as \nunDursleyish as it was possible to be. The Dursleys shuddered to \nthink what the neighbors would sa y if the Potters arrived in the \nstreet. The Dursleys knew that the Potters had a small son, too, but \nthey had never even seen him. Th is boy was another good reason \nfor keeping the Potters away; they didn\u2019t want Dudl ey mixing with \na child like that. \nWhen Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday \nour story starts, there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to \nsuggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happen-\ning all over the country. Mr. Durs ley hummed as he picked out his \nmost boring tie for work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily \nas she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high chair. \nNone of them noticed a large, tawny owl flu tter past the \nwindow. \nAt half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked \nMrs. Dursley on the cheek, and tr ied to kiss Dudley good-bye but \nmissed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing \nhis cereal at the walls. \u201cLittle tyke ,\u201d chortled Mr. Dursley as he left \nthe house. He got into his car an d backed out of number four\u2019s \ndrive. \nIt was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of \nsomething peculiar \u2014 a cat read ing a map. For a second, Mr. \nDursley didn\u2019t realize what he ha d seen \u2014 then he jerked his head \naround to look again. There was a tabby cat standing on the corner \n \nTHE BOY WHO LIVED \n\u0091 3 \u0091 of Privet Drive, but there wasn\u2019t a map in sight. What could he \nhave been thinking of? It must have been a trick of the light. Mr. \nDursley blinked and stared at the ca t. It stared back. As Mr. Durs-\nley drove around the corner and up the road, he watched the cat in \nhis mirror. It was now reading the si gn that said Privet Drive \u2014 no, \nlooking at the sign; cats couldn\u2019t read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley \ngave himself a little shake and pu t the cat out of his mind. As he \ndrove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of \ndrills he was hoping to get that day. \nBut on the edge of town, drills were driven out of his mind by \nsomething else. As he sat in the usual morning traffic jam, he \ncouldn\u2019t help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely \ndressed people about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn\u2019t bear \npeople who dressed in funny cl othes \u2014 the getups you saw on \nyoung people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He \ndrummed his fingers on the steeri ng wheel and his eyes fell on a \nhuddle of these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whis-\npering excitedly together. Mr. Du rsley was enraged to see that a \ncouple of them weren\u2019t young at a ll; why, that man had to be older \nthan he was, and wear ing an emerald-green cloak! The nerve of \nhim! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt \u2014 these people were obviously collecting for some-\nthing . . . yes, that would be it . The traffic moved on and a few \nminutes later, Mr. Dursley arrive d in the Grunnings parking lot, \nhis mind back on drills. \nMr. Dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office \non the ninth floor. If he hadn\u2019t, he might have found it harder to \nconcentrate on drills that morning. He didn\u2019t see the owls swoop-"

Most of them had never se en an owl even at nighttime. Mr. \nDursley, however, had a perfectly normal, owl-free morning. He \nyelled at five different people. He made several important tele-\nphone calls and shouted a bit mo re.

He looked back at \nthe whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them, but \nthought better of it. \nHe dashed back across the road , hurried up to his office, \nsnapped at his secretar y not to disturb him, seized his telephone, \nand had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put the rece iver back down and stroked his \nmustache, thinking . . . no, he wa s being stupid. Potter wasn\u2019t such \nan unusual name. He was sure ther e were lots of people called Pot-\nter who had a son called Harry. Come to think of it, he wasn\u2019t even sure his nephew was called Harry. He\u2019d never even seen the boy. It \n \nTHE BOY WHO LIVED \n\u0091 5 \u0091 might have been Harvey. Or Haro ld. There was no point in wor-\nrying Mrs. Dursley; she always go t so upset at any mention of her \nsister.

It was a few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that the man \nwas wearing a violet cloak. He didn \u2019t seem at all upset at being al-\nmost knocked to the ground. On the contrary, his face split into a \nwide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare, \n\u201cDon\u2019t be sorry, my dear sir, for nothing could upset me today! Re-\njoice, for You-Know-Who has gone at last! Even Muggles like your-\nself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!\u201d \nAnd the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around the middle and \nwalked off. \nMr. Dursley stood rooted to the spot. He had been hugged by a \ncomplete stranger. He also thought he had been called a Muggle, \nwhatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried to his car and set off \nfor home, hoping he was imagin ing things, which he had never \nhoped before, because he didn \u2019t approve of imagination. \nAs he pulled into the driveway of number four, the first thing he \nsaw \u2014 and it didn\u2019t improve his mood \u2014 was the tabby cat he\u2019d \nspotted that morning. It was now sitting on his ga rden wall. He \nwas sure it was the same one; it had the same markings around its \neyes. \n\u201cShoo!\u201d said Mr. Dursley loudly."

Trying to pull himself to-\ngether, he let himself into the house. He was still determined not to mention anything to his wife. \nMrs. Dursley had had a nice, norm al day. She told him over din-\nner all about Mrs. Next Door\u2019s pr oblems with her daughter and how \nDudley had learned a new word (\u201c Won\u2019t!\u201d). Mr. Dursley tried to \nact normally. When Dudley had been put to bed, he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news: \n\u201cAnd finally, bird-watchers everyw here have reported that the \nnation\u2019s owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although \nowls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight, \nthere have been hundreds of sighti ngs of these birds flying in every \ndirection since sunrise.

And now, over to Jim \nMcGuffin with the weather. Going to be any more showers of owls \ntonight, Jim?\u201d \n\u201cWell, Ted,\u201d said the weatherman , \u201cI don\u2019t know about that, but \nit\u2019s not only the owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers as \nfar apart as Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning in to \ntell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday, they\u2019ve had a downpour of shooting stars!

He\u2019d have to say something to her. He cleared \nhis throat nervously. \u201cEr \u2014 Petuni a, dear \u2014 you haven\u2019t heard from \nyour sister lately, have you?\u201d \nAs he had expected, Mrs. Dursle y looked shocked and angry. Af-\nter all, they normally preten ded she didn\u2019t have a sister. \n\u201cNo,\u201d she said sharply. \u201cWhy?\u201d \n\u201cFunny stuff on the news,\u201d Mr . Dursley mumbled. \u201cOwls . . . \nshooting stars . . . and there were a lot of funny-looking people in town today . . .\u201d \n\u201cSo?\u201d snapped Mrs. Dursley. \n\u201cWell, I just thought . . . maybe . . . it was something to do \nwith . . . you know . . . her crowd.\u201d \nMrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley \nwondered whether he dared tell he r he\u2019d heard the name \u201cPotter.\u201d \nHe decided he didn\u2019t da re. Instead he said, as casually as he could, \n\u201cTheir son \u2014 he\u2019d be about Dudley\u2019s age now, wouldn\u2019t he?\u201d \n\u201cI suppose so,\u201d said Mrs. Dursley stiffly. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s his name again?

If it did . . . if it got out th at they were related to \na pair of \u2014 well, he didn\u2019t think he could bear it. \nThe Dursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but \nMr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over in his mind. His last, \ncomforting thought before he fell as leep was that even if the Potters \nwere involved, there was no reason for them to come near him and \nMrs. Dursley. The Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought about them and their kind. . . .

It was \nsitting as still as a statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far cor-\nner of Privet Drive. It didn\u2019t so much as quiver when a car door \nslammed on the next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. \nIn fact, it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all. \nA man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching, ap-\npeared so suddenly and silently you\u2019d have thought he\u2019d just \npopped out of the ground. The cat\u2019s tail twitched and its eyes nar-\nrowed. \nNothing like this man had ever been seen on Privet Drive. He \nwas tall, thin, and very old, judgin g by the silver of his hair and \nbeard, which were both long enough to tuck into his belt. He was \nwearing long robes, a purple cloak that swept the ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and \nsparkling behind half-moon spectacl es and his nose was very long \nand crooked, as though it had been broken at least twice. This \nman\u2019s name was Albus Dumbledore. \nTHE BOY WHO LIVED \n\u0091 9 \u0091 Albus Dumbledore didn\u2019t seem to realize that he had just arrived \nin a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwel-\ncome. He was busy rummaging in his cloak, looking for some-thing. But he did seem to realize he was being watched, because he \nlooked up suddenly at the cat, wh ich was still staring at him from \nthe other end of the street. For so me reason, the sight of the cat \nseemed to amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, \u201cI should have \nknown.\u201d \nHe found what he was looking for in his inside pocket. It \nseemed to be a silver cigarette lighte r. He flicked it open, held it up \nin the air, and clicked it. The near est street lamp went out with a \nlittle pop. He clicked it again \u2014 the next lamp flickered into dark-\nness. Twelve times he clicked the Put-Outer, until the only lights \nleft on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance, \nwhich were the eyes of the cat wa tching him. If anyone looked out \nof their window now, even beady-eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn\u2019t \nbe able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement. \nDumbledore slipped the Put-Outer back inside his cloak and set \noff down the street toward number four, where he sat down on the \nwall next to the cat. He didn\u2019t look at it, but after a moment he \nspoke to it. \n\u201cFancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.\u201d \nHe turned to smile at the tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was \nsmiling at a rather severe-lookin g woman who was wearing square \nglasses exactly the shape of the ma rkings the cat had had around its \neyes. She, too, was wearing a cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair \nwas drawn into a tight bun. Sh e looked distinctly ruffled. \n\u201cHow did you know it was me?\u201d she asked. \n\u201cMy dear Professor, I\u2019ve neve r seen a cat sit so stiffly.\u201d"

He was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least \nfive times as wide. He looked simply too big to be allowed, and so \nwild \u2014 long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his \nface, he had hands the size of tr ash can lids, and his feet in their \nleather boots were like baby dolphins. In his va st, muscular arms he \nwas holding a bund le of blankets. \n\u201cHagrid,\u201d said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. \u201cAt last.

He laid Harry gently on the \ndoorstep, took a letter out of his cloak, tucked it inside Harry\u2019s \nblankets, and then came back to the other two. For a full minute \nthe three of them stood and looked at the little bu ndle; Hagrid\u2019s \nshoulders shook, Professor McGonaga ll blinked furi ously, and the \ntwinkling light that usually shon e from Dumbledore\u2019s eyes seemed \nto have gone out. \n\u201cWell,\u201d said Dumbledore finally, \u201cthat\u2019s that.

G\u2019night, Professor McGonagall \u2014 Professor Dumble-\ndore, sir.\u201d \nWiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung \nhimself onto the motorcycle and ki cked the engine in to life; with a \nroar it rose into the air and off into the night. \n\u201cI shall see you soon, I expect , Professor McGonagall,\u201d said \nDumbledore, nodding to her. Pro fessor McGonagall blew her nose \nin reply. \nDumbledore turned and walked back down the street. On the \ncorner he stopped and took out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it \nonce, and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so \nthat Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a \ntabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street. \nHe could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number \nfour. \n\u201cGood luck, Harry,\u201d he murmured. He turned on his heel and \nwith a swish of his cloak, he was gone. \nTHE BOY WHO LIVED \n\u0091 17 \u0091 A breeze ruffled the neat hedges of Privet Drive, which lay silent \nand tidy under the inky sky, the very last place you would expect \nastonishing things to happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his \nblankets without waking up. One small hand closed on the letter \nbeside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not know-\ning he was famous, not knowing he would be woken in a few hours\u2019 time by Mrs. Dursley\u2019s scream as she opened the front door \nto put out the milk bottles, nor that he would spend the next few \nweeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley. . . . He \ncouldn\u2019t know that at this very moment, people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in \nhushed voices: \u201cTo Harry Po tter \u2014 the boy who lived!\u201d \n \nC H A P T E R T W O \n \n\u0091 18 \u0091 THE V ANISHING GLASS \n \n \n \nearly ten years had passed si nce the Dursleys had woken \nup to find their nephew on the front step, but Privet Drive \nhad hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front gar-\ndens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys\u2019 front door; \nit crept into their living room, which was almost exactly the same \nas it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful \nnews report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantel-\npiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, \nthere had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink \nbeach ball wearing different-colored bonnets \u2014 but Dudley Durs-\nley was no longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large \nblond boy riding his first bicycle, on a carousel at the fair, playing \na computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed by his \nmother. The room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the \nhouse, too. \n N \nThe Vanishing Glass \n\u0091 19 \u0091 Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not \nfor long. His Aunt Petunia was aw ake and it was her shrill voice \nthat made the first noise of the day. \n\u201cUp! Get up! Now!\u201d \nHarry woke with a st art. His aunt rapped on the door again. \n\u201cUp!\u201d she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward the \nkitchen and then the sound of th e frying pan being put on the \nstove. He rolled onto his back an d tried to remember the dream he \nhad been having. It ha d been a good one. Ther e had been a flying \nmotorcycle in it. He had a funny feeling he\u2019d had the same dream \nbefore. \nHis aunt was back outside the door. \n\u201cAre you up yet?\u201d she demanded. \n\u201cNearly,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cWell, get a move on, I want yo u to look after the bacon. And \ndon\u2019t you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect on Duddy\u2019s \nbirthday.\u201d \nHarry groaned. \u201cWhat did you say?\u201d his aunt snapped thro ugh the door. \n\u201cNothing, nothing . . .\u201d \nDudley\u2019s birthday \u2014 how could he have forgotten? Harry got \nslowly out of bed and started look ing for socks. He found a pair \nunder his bed and, after pulling a spider off one of them, put them \non. Harry was used to spiders, because the cupboard under the \nstairs was full of them, an d that was where he slept. \nWhen he was dressed he went dow n the hall into the kitchen. \nThe table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley\u2019s birthday pres-\nents.

Dudley \u2019s favorite punching bag was \nHarry, but he couldn\u2019t often catch h im. Harry didn\u2019t look it, but he \nwas very fast. \nPerhaps it had something to do wi th living in a dark cupboard, \nbut Harry had always been small and skinny for his age. He looked \neven smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to \nwear were old clothes of Dudley \u2019s, and Dudley was about four \ntimes bigger than he was. Harry had a thin face, knobbly knees, \nblack hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held to-\ngether with a lot of Scotch tape because of all the times Dudley had \npunched him on the nose. The on ly thing Harry liked about his \nown appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was \nshaped like a bolt of lightning. He had had it as long as he could re-\nmember, and the first question he could ever remember asking his \nAunt Petunia was how he had gotten it. \n\u201cIn the car crash when your parents died,\u201d she had said. \u201cAnd \ndon\u2019t ask questions.\u201d \nDon\u2019t ask questions \u2014 that was the first rule for a quiet life with \nthe Dursleys. \nUncle Vernon entered the kitche n as Harry was turning over the \nbacon. \n\u201cComb your hair!\u201d he barked, by way of a mo rning greeting. \nAbout once a week, Uncle Vernon looked over the top of his \nnewspaper and shouted that Harr y needed a haircut. Harry must \nhave had more haircuts than the rest of the bo ys in his class put \n \nThe Vanishing Glass \n\u0091 21 \u0091 together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that \nway \u2014 all over the place. \nHarry was frying eggs by the time Dudley arrived in the kitchen \nwith his mother. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle Vernon. He had a \nlarge pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick \nblond hair that lay smoothly on hi s thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia \noften said that Dudley looked like a baby an gel \u2014 Harry often said \nthat Dudley looked like a pig in a wig. \nHarry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table, which was \ndifficult as there wasn\u2019t much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was \ncounting his presen ts. His face fell. \n\u201cThirty-six,\u201d he said, looking up at his mother and father. \n\u201cThat\u2019s two less than last year.\u201d \n\u201cDarling, you haven\u2019t counted Aunt ie Marge\u2019s present, see, it\u2019s \nhere under this big one from Mommy and Daddy.\u201d \n\u201cAll right, thirty-seven then,\u201d said Dudley, going red in the face. \nHarry, who could see a huge Dudl ey tantrum coming on, began \nwolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case Dudley turned the table over. \nAunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said \nquickly, \u201cAnd we\u2019ll buy you another two presents while we\u2019re out \ntoday. How\u2019s that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?\u201d \nDudley thought for a moment. It looked like hard work. Finally \nhe said slowly, \u201cSo I\u2019ll have thirty . . . thirty . . .\u201d \n\u201cThirty-nine, sweetums,\u201d said Aunt Petunia. \n\u201cOh.\u201d Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel. \n\u201cAll right then.\u201d \nUncle Vernon chuckled."

Every year on Dudley\u2019s birthday, his parents took him and a \nfriend out for the day, to adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, \nor the movies. Every year, Harry was left behind with Mrs. Figg, a \nmad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there.

His aunt and uncle \nhadn\u2019t been able to think of anyt hing else to do with him, but be-\nfore they\u2019d left, Uncle Vern on had taken Harry aside. \n\u201cI\u2019m warning you,\u201d he had said, putting his large purple face \nright up close to Harry\u2019s, \u201cI\u2019m warning you now, boy \u2014 any funny \nbusiness, anything at all \u2014 and yo u\u2019ll be in that cupboard from \nnow until Christmas.\u201d \nI\u2019m not going to do anything,\u201d said Harry, \u201chonestly . . .\u201d \nBut Uncle Vernon didn\u2019t beli eve him. No one ever did. \nThe problem was, strange things often happened around Harry \nand it was just no good telling the Dursleys he didn\u2019t make them \nhappen. \nOnce, Aunt Petunia, tired of Harry coming back from the bar-\nbers looking as though he hadn\u2019t been at all, had taken a pair of \nkitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except \nfor his bangs, which she left \u201cto hide that horrible scar.\u201d Dudley \nhad laughed himself silly at Ha rry, who spent a sleepless night \nimagining school the next day, wh ere he was already laughed at for \nhis baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had \ngotten up to find his hair exactly as it had been before Aunt Petu-\nnia had sheared it off. He had b een given a week in his cupboard \nfor this, even though he ha d tried to explain that he couldn\u2019t explain \nhow it had grown back so quickly. \nAnother time, Aunt Petunia had b een trying to force him into a \nrevolting old sweater of Dudley\u2019s (brown with orange puff balls). The harder she tried to pull it ov er his head, the smaller it seemed \nto become, until finally it might have fitted a hand puppet, but \ncertainly wouldn\u2019t fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must \n \nThe Vanishing Glass \n\u0091 25 \u0091 have shrunk in the wash and, to his great relief, Harry wasn\u2019t pun-\nished. \nOn the other hand, he\u2019d gotten into terrible trouble for being \nfound on the roof of the school kitchens. Dudley\u2019s gang had been \nchasing him as usual when, as much to Harry\u2019s surprise as anyone \nelse\u2019s, there he was sitting on the chimney. The Dursleys had re-ceived a very angry letter from Harry\u2019s headmistress telling them \nHarry had been climbing school buildings. But all he\u2019d tried to do \n(as he shouted at Uncle Vernon through the locked door of his cup-\nboard) was jump behind the big trash cans outside the kitchen \ndoors. Harry supposed that the wind must have caught him in \nmid-jump. \nBut today, nothing was going to go wrong. It was even worth be-\ning with Dudley and Piers to be spending the day somewhere that \nwasn\u2019t school, his cupboard, or Mr s. Figg\u2019s cabbage-smelling living \nroom. \nWhile he drove, Uncle Vernon co mplained to Aunt Petunia. He \nliked to complain about things: people at work, Harry, the council, \nHarry, the bank, and Harry were just a few of his favorite subjects. \nThis morning, it was motorcycles. \n\u201c. . . roaring along like maniac s, the young hoodlums,\u201d he said, \nas a motorcycle overtook them. \n\u201cI had a dream about a motorcycle,\u201d said Harry, remembering \nsuddenly. \u201cIt was flying.\u201d \nUncle Vernon nearly crashed into the car in front.

If there was one thing the \nDursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talk-\ning about anything acting in a way it shouldn\u2019t, no matter if it was \nin a dream or even a cartoon \u2014 they seemed to think he might get \ndangerous ideas. \nIt was a very sunny Saturday an d the zoo was crowded with fam-\nilies. The Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams at the entrance and then, because the smiling lady in the \nvan had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him \naway, they bought him a cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn\u2019t bad, either, \nHarry thought, licking it as they watched a gorill a scratching its \nhead who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn\u2019t \nblond. \nHarry had the best morning he\u2019d had in a long time. He was \ncareful to walk a little way apart from the Dursleys so that Dudley \nand Piers, who were starting to get bored with the animals by \nlunchtime, wouldn\u2019t fall back on their favorite hobby of hitting \nhim. They ate in the zoo rest aurant, and when Dudley had a \ntantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn\u2019t have enough ice \ncream on top, Uncle Vernon bo ught him another one and Harry \nwas allowed to finish the first. \nHarry felt, afterward, that he sh ould have known it was all too \ngood to last. \nAfter lunch they went to the rept ile house. It was cool and dark \nin there, with lit windows all along the walls. Behind the glass, all \nsorts of lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits of wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted to see huge, poisonous \n \nThe Vanishing Glass \n\u0091 27 \u0091 cobras and thick, man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found \nthe largest snake in the place. It could have wrapped its body twice \naround Uncle Vernon\u2019s car and crus hed it into a trash can \u2014 but at \nthe moment it didn\u2019t look in the mood. In fact, it was fast asleep. \nDudley stood with his nose presse d against the glass, staring at \nthe glistening brown coils. \n\u201cMake it move,\u201d he whined at his father. Uncle Vernon tapped \non the glass, but the snake didn\u2019t budge. \n\u201cDo it again,\u201d Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the glass \nsmartly with his knuckles, but the snake just snoozed on. \n\u201cThis is boring,\u201d Dudley moaned. He shuffled away. \nHarry moved in front of the tank and looked intently at the \nsnake. He wouldn\u2019t have been surp rised if it had died of boredom \nitself \u2014 no company except stupid people drumming their fingers \non the glass trying to disturb it all day long. It was worse than hav-\ning a cupboard as a bedroom, where the only visitor was Aunt Petu-\nnia hammering on the door to wake you up; at least he got to visit \nthe rest of the house. \nThe snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it \nraised its head until its eyes were on a level with Harry\u2019s. \nIt winked. \nHarry stared. Then he looked quickly around to see if anyone \nwas watching. They weren\u2019t. He looked back at the snake and \nwinked, too. \nThe snake jerked its head towa rd Uncle Vernon and Dudley, \nthen raised its eyes to the ceilin g.

YOU WON\u2019T BELIEVE \nWHAT IT\u2019S DOING!\u201d \nDudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could. \n\u201cOut of the way, you,\u201d he sa id, punching Harry in the ribs. \nCaught by surprise, Harry fell hard on the concrete floor. What \ncame next happened so fast no one saw how it happened \u2014 one \nsecond, Piers and Dudley were lean ing right up close to the glass, \nthe next, they had leapt ba ck with howls of horror. \nHarry sat up and gasped; the glass front of the boa constrictor\u2019s \ntank had vanished. The great snak e was uncoiling itself rapidly, \nslithering out onto the floor. People throughout the reptile house screamed and started ru nning for the exits. \nAs the snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn a low, \nhissing voice said, \u201cBrazil, here I come. . . . Th anksss, amigo.\u201d \nThe keeper of the reptil e house was in shock. \n \nThe Vanishing Glass \n\u0091 29 \u0091 \u201cBut the glass,\u201d he kept sayi ng, \u201cwhere did the glass go?\u201d \nThe zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, \nsweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dud-\nley could only gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the snake hadn\u2019t \ndone anything except snap playfully at their heels as it passed, but \nby the time they were all back in Uncle Vernon\u2019s car, Dudley was \ntelling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was \nswearing it had tried to squeeze him to death. But worst of all, for \nHarry at least, was Piers calmin g down enough to say, \u201cHarry was \ntalking to it, were n\u2019t you, Harry?\u201d \nUncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out of the house be-\nfore starting on Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He \nmanaged to say, \u201cGo \u2014 cupboard \u2014 stay \u2014 no meals,\u201d before he \ncollapsed into a chair, and Aunt Petunia had to run and get him a \nlarge brandy. \n \nHarry lay in his dark cu pboard much later, wishing he had a watch. \nHe didn\u2019t know what time it was and he couldn\u2019t be sure the Durs-\nleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn\u2019t risk sneaking to the kitchen for some food. \nHe\u2019d lived with the Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable \nyears, as long as he could remember, ever since he\u2019d been a baby \nand his parents had died in that car crash. He couldn\u2019t remember \nbeing in the car when his parent s had died. Sometimes, when he \nstrained his memory during long hours in his cupboard, he came up with a strange vision: a blinding flash of green light and a burn-\ning pain on his forehead.

She let Harry watch televisi on and gave him a bit of choco-\nlate cake that tasted as though she\u2019d had it fo r several years. \nThat evening, Dudley paraded ar ound the living room for the \nfamily in his brand-new uniform. Smeltings boys wore maroon \ntailcoats, orange knickerbockers, an d flat straw hats called boaters. \nThey also carried knobbly sticks, used for hitting each other while \nthe teachers weren\u2019t lo oking.

Three \nthings lay on the doormat: a postca rd from Uncle Vernon\u2019s sister \nMarge, who was vacationing on th e Isle of Wight, a brown enve-\nlope that looked like a bill, and \u2014 a letter for Harry. \nHarry picked it up and stared at it, his heart twanging like a gi-\nant elastic band. No one, ever, in his whole life, had written to him. \nWho would? He had no friends, no other relatives \u2014 he didn\u2019t be-\nlong to the library, so he\u2019d never even got rude notes asking for \nbooks back. Yet here it was, a le tter, addressed so plainly there \ncould be no mistake: \n \nMr. H. Potter \nThe Cupboard under the Stairs 4 Privet Drive Little Whinging Surrey \n \nThe envelope was thick and heavy, made of yellowish parchment, \nand the address was written in em erald-green ink. There was no \nstamp. \nTurning the envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw a pur-\nple wax seal bearing a coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badger, and a \nsnake surrounding a large letter H. \n\u201cHurry up, boy!\u201d shouted Uncl e Vernon from the kitchen. \n\u201cWhat are you doing, checking for letter bombs?\u201d He chuckled at \nhis own joke. \nHarry went back to the kitchen, still staring at his letter.

His face went from \nred to green faster than a set of traffic lights. And it didn\u2019t stop \nthere. Within seconds it was the grayish w hite of old porridge. \n\u201cP-P-Petunia!\u201d he gasped. \nDudley tried to grab the letter to read it, but Uncle Vernon held \nit high out of his reach. Aunt Petu nia took it curiously and read the \nfirst line. For a moment it looked as though she might faint. She \nclutched her throat and made a choking noise. \n\u201cVernon! Oh my goodness \u2014 Vernon!\u201d \nThey stared at each other, seeming to have forgotten that Harry \nand Dudley were still in the room. Dudley wasn\u2019t used to being ig-\nnored.

Exactly what he was l ooking for, none of them knew. He \ndrove them into the middle of a forest, got out, looked around, \nshook his head, got back in the car, and off they went again. The \nsame thing happened in the middl e of a plowed field, halfway \nacross a suspension bridge, and at the top of a multilevel parking \ngarage. \n\u201cDaddy\u2019s gone mad, hasn\u2019t he ?\u201d Dudley aske d Aunt Petunia \ndully late that afternoon.

This reminded Harry of something. If it was Mon-\nday \u2014 and you could usually count on Dudley to know the days of \nthe week, because of television \u2014 then tomorrow, Tuesday, was \nHarry\u2019s eleventh birthday. Of course, his birthdays were never ex-actly fun \u2014 last year, the Dursle ys had given him a coat hanger \nand a pair of Uncle Vernon\u2019s old socks. Still, you weren\u2019t eleven \nevery day. \nUncle Vernon was back and he wa s smiling. He was also carry-\ning a long, thin package and didn \u2019t answer Aunt Petunia when she \nasked what he\u2019d bought. \n\u201cFound the perfect place!\u201d he said. \u201cCome on!

One \nthing was certain, there was no television in there. \n\u201cStorm forecast for tonight!\u201d sa id Uncle Vernon gleefully, clap-\nping his hands together. \u201cAnd this gentleman\u2019s kindly agreed to \nlend us his boat!\u201d \nA toothless old man came ambling up to them, pointing, with a \nrather wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing in the iron-gray \nwater below them. \n\u201cI\u2019ve already got us some rations,\u201d said Uncle Vernon, \u201cso all \naboard!\u201d \nIt was freezing in the boat. Ic y sea spray and rain crept down \ntheir necks and a chilly wind whipped their faces. After what \nseemed like hours they reached the rock, where Uncle Vernon, slip-\nping and sliding, led the wa y to the broken-down house. \nThe inside was horrible; it smelle d strongly of seaweed, the wind \nwhistled through the gaps in th e wooden walls, and the fireplace \nwas damp and empty. Ther e were only two rooms. \nUncle Vernon\u2019s rations turned out to be a bag of chips each and \nfour bananas. He tried to start a fire but the empty chip bags just \nsmoked and shriveled up. \n\u201cCould do with some of those letters now, eh?\u201d he said cheer-\nfully. \nHe was in a very good mood. Ob viously he thought nobody \nstood a chance of reaching them here in a storm to deliver mail. \nHarry privately agreed, though th e thought didn\u2019t cheer him up \nat all. \nAs night fell, the promised stor m blew up around them. Spray \nfrom the high waves splattered the walls of the hut and a fierce \n \nTHE LETTERS FROM NO ONE \n\u0091 45 \u0091 wind rattled the filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found a few moldy \nblankets in the second room and made up a bed for Dudley on the \nmoth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle Ve rnon went off to the lumpy bed \nnext door, and Harry was left to find the soft est bit of floor he \ncould and to curl up under the thinnest, most ragged blanket. \nThe storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went \non. Harry couldn\u2019t sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying to get \ncomfortable, his stomach rumbling with hunger. Dudley\u2019s snores \nwere drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near mid-\nnight. The lighted dial of Dudley\u2019s watch, which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wris t, told Harry he\u2019d be eleven in ten \nminutes\u2019 time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, won-\ndering if the Dursleys would reme mber at all, wondering where the \nletter writer was now. \nFive minutes to go. Harry heard something creak outside. He \nhoped the roof wasn\u2019t going to fall in, although he might be \nwarmer if it did. Four minutes to go. Maybe the house in Privet \nDrive would be so full of letters wh en they got back that he\u2019d be \nable to steal one somehow. \nThree minutes to go. Was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock \nlike that? And (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching \nnoise? Was the rock crumbling into the sea? \nOne minute to go and he\u2019d be eleven. Thirty seconds . . . \ntwenty . . . ten . . . nine \u2014 maybe he\u2019d wake Dudley up, just to annoy him \u2014 three . . . two . . . one . . . \nBOOM. The whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring at \nthe door. Someone was outside, knocking to come in. \nC H A P T E R F O U R \n \n\u0091 46 \u0091 THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS \n \n \n \nOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. \n\u201cWhere\u2019s the cannon?\u201d he said stupidly. \nThere was a crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skid-\nding into the room. He was hold ing a rifle in his hands \u2014 now \nthey knew what had been in the lo ng, thin package he had brought \nwith them. \n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d he shouted. \u201cI warn you \u2014 I\u2019m armed!\u201d \nThere was a pause. Then \u2014 SMASH! \nThe door was hit with such forc e that it swung clean off its \nhinges and with a deafening cras h landed flat on the floor. \nA giant of a man was standing in the doorway. His face was al-\nmost completely hidden by a long, shaggy mane of hair and a wild, \ntangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black \nbeetles under all the hair. \n B \nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS \n\u0091 47 \u0091 The giant squeezed his way into the hut, stooping so that his \nhead just brushed the ceiling. He bent down, picked up the door, \nand fitted it easily back into it s frame. The noise of the storm out-\nside dropped a little. He turned to look at them all. \n\u201cCouldn\u2019t make us a cup o\u2019 tea, could yeh? It\u2019s not been an easy \njourney. . . .\u201d \nHe strode over to the sofa wher e Dudley sat frozen with fear. \n\u201cBudge up, yeh great lump,\u201d said the stranger. \nDudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother, who was \ncrouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon. \n\u201cAn\u2019 here\u2019s Harry!\u201d said the giant. \nHarry looked up into the fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that \nthe beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile. \n\u201cLas\u2019 time I saw you, you was only a baby,\u201d said the giant. \u201cYeh \nlook a lot like yer dad, but yeh\u2019ve got yer mom\u2019s eyes.\u201d \nUncle Vernon made a funny rasping noise. \n\u201cI demand that you le ave at once, sir!\u201d he said. \u201cYou are break-\ning and entering!\u201d \n\u201cAh, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,\u201d said the giant; he \nreached over the back of the sofa , jerked the gun out of Uncle Ver-\nnon\u2019s hands, bent it into a knot as easily as if it had been made of \nrubber, and threw it into a corner of the room. \nUncle Vernon made another funny noise, like a mouse being \ntrodden on. \n\u201cAnyway \u2014 Harry,\u201d said the gian t, turning his back on the \nDursleys, \u201ca very happy birthday to yeh.

Inside was a \nlarge, sticky chocolate cake with Happy Birthday Harry written on \nit in green icing. \nHarry looked up at th e giant. He meant to say thank you, but \nthe words got lost on the way to his mouth, and what he said in-\nstead was, \u201cWho are you?\u201d \nThe giant chuckled. \n\u201cTrue, I haven\u2019t introduced mese lf.

He bent down over the fire place; they couldn\u2019t \nsee what he was doing but when he drew back a second later, there was a roaring fire there. It filled the whole damp hut with flickering \nlight and Harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he\u2019d sunk \ninto a hot bath. \nThe giant sat back down on th e sofa, which sagged under his \nweight, and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his \ncoat: a copper kettle, a squashy package of sausages, a poker, a \nteapot, several chipped mugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig fr om before starting to make tea. Soon the hut \nwas full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage. Nobody said a \nthing while the giant was working, but as he slid the first six fat, \njuicy, slightly burnt sausages from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a lit-\ntle. Uncle Vernon said sharply, \u201cDon \u2019t touch anything he gives you, \nDudley.\u201d \nThe giant chuckled darkly. \nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS \n\u0091 49 \u0091 \u201cYer great puddin\u2019 of a son don\u2019 need fattenin\u2019 anymore, Durs-\nley, don\u2019 worry.\u201d \nHe passed the sausages to Harr y, who was so hungry he had \nnever tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn\u2019t take his \neyes off the giant. Finally, as no body seemed about to explain any-\nthing, he said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry, but I st ill don\u2019t really know who you are.\u201d \nThe giant took a gulp of tea an d wiped his mouth with the back \nof his hand. \n\u201cCall me Hagrid,\u201d he said, \u201cevery one does.

As Ha-\ngrid\u2019s story came to a close, he saw again the blinding flash of green \nlight, more clearly th an he had ever rememb ered it before \u2014 and \nhe remembered something else, for th e first time in his life: a high, \ncold, cruel laugh. \nHagrid was watching him sadly. \n\u201cTook yeh from the ruined hous e myself, on Dumbledore\u2019s or-\nders. Brought yeh ter this lot . . .\u201d \n\u201cLoad of old tosh,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had \nalmost forgotten that the Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon cer-\ntainly seemed to have got back his courage. He was glaring at Ha-\ngrid and his fists were clenched. \n\u201cNow, you listen here, boy,\u201d he sn arled, \u201cI accept there\u2019s some-\nthing strange about you, probably nothing a good beating wouldn\u2019t \nhave cured \u2014 and as for all this about your parents, well, they were \nweirdos, no denying it, and the worl d\u2019s better off without them in \nmy opinion \u2014 asked for all they got, getting mixed up with these \nwizarding types \u2014 just what I expected, always knew they\u2019d come \nto a sticky end \u2014\u201d \nBut at that moment, Hagrid leap t from the sofa and drew a bat-\ntered pink umbrella from inside his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon like a sword, he said, \u201cI\u2019m warning you, Dursley \u2014 I\u2019m warning you \u2014 one mo re word . . .\u201d \nIn danger of being speared on the end of an umbrella by a \nbearded giant, Uncle Vernon\u2019s cour age failed again; he flattened \nhimself against the wall and fell silent. \n \nTHE KEEPER OF THE KEYS \n\u0091 57 \u0091 \u201cThat\u2019s better,\u201d said Hagrid, br eathing heavily and sitting back \ndown on the sofa, which this time sagged right down to the floor. \nHarry, meanwhile, still had questions to ask, hundreds of them. \n\u201cBut what happened to Vol- , sorry \u2014 I mean, You-Know-\nWho?\u201d \n\u201cGood question, Harry. Disappear ed. Vanished. Same night he \ntried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That\u2019s the biggest \nmyst\u2019ry, see . . . he was gettin\u2019 more an\u2019 more powerful \u2014 why\u2019d \nhe go? \n\u201cSome say he died. Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he \nhad enough human left in him to die. Some say he\u2019s still out there, \nbidin\u2019 his time, like, but I don\u2019 believe it. People who was on his \nside came back ter ours. Some of \u2019em came outta kinda trances. \nDon\u2019 reckon they could\u2019ve do ne if he was comin\u2019 back. \n\u201cMost of us reckon he\u2019s still out there somewhere but lost his \npowers. Too weak to carry on. \u2019Cause somethin\u2019 about you finished \nhim, Harry. There was somethin\u2019 goin\u2019 on that night he hadn\u2019t \ncounted on \u2014 I dunno what it was, no one does \u2014 but somethin\u2019 \nabout you stumped him, all right.\u201d \nHagrid looked at Harry with wa rmth and respect blazing in his \neyes, but Harry, instead of feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure \nthere had been a horrible mistake. A wizard? Him? How could he \npossibly be? He\u2019d spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bul-\nlied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Ve rnon; if he was really a wizard, \nwhy hadn\u2019t they been turned into warty toads every time they\u2019d tried to lock him in his cupboard? If he\u2019d once defeated the great-\nest sorcerer in the world, how co me Dudley had al ways been able \nto kick him around like a football?"

They were in a narrow stone \npassageway lit with flaming torches. It sloped steeply down-\nward and there were little railwa y tracks on the floor.

The ra ttling cart seemed to know its \nown way, because Griphook wasn\u2019t steering. \nHarry\u2019s eyes stung as the cold air rushed past them, but he kept \nthem wide open. Once, he thought he saw a burst of fire at the end \nof a passage and twisted around to see if it was a dragon, but too \nlate \u2014 they plunged even deeper , passing an underground lake \nwhere huge stalactites and stalag mites grew from the ceiling and \nfloor. \n\u201cI never know,\u201d Harry called to Hagrid over the noise of the \ncart, \u201cwhat\u2019s the difference between a stalagmite and a stalactite?\u201d \n\u201cStalagmite\u2019s got an \u2018m\u2019 in it,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAn\u2019 don\u2019 ask me \nquestions just now, I think I\u2019m gonna be sick.\u201d \nDIAGON ALLEY \n\u0091 75 \u0091 He did look very green , and when the cart st opped at last beside \na small door in the passage wall, Hagrid got out and had to lean \nagainst the wall to stop his knees from trembling. \nGriphook unlocked the door. A lot of green smoke came billow-\ning out, and as it cleared, Har ry gasped. Inside were mounds of \ngold coins. Columns of silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts. \n\u201cAll yours,\u201d smiled Hagrid. \nAll Harry\u2019s \u2014 it was incredible. The Dursleys couldn\u2019t have \nknown about this or they\u2019d have had it from him faster than blink-ing. How often had they complain ed how much Harry cost them \nto keep? And all the time there ha d been a small fo rtune belonging \nto him, buried deep under London. \nHagrid helped Harry pile some of it into a bag. \n\u201cThe gold ones are Galleons,\u201d he explained. \u201cSeventeen silver \nSickles to a Galleon and twenty- nine Knuts to a Sickle, it\u2019s \neasy enough. Right, that should be enough fer a couple o\u2019 terms, \nwe\u2019ll keep the rest safe for yeh. \u201d He turned to Griphook. \u201cVault \nseven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?\u201d \n\u201cOne speed only,\u201d said Griphook. \nThey were going even deeper no w and gathering speed. The air \nbecame colder and colder as they hurtled round tight corners. They \nwent rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over the side to try to see what was down at the dark bottom, but Ha-\ngrid groaned and pulled him back by the scruff of his neck. \nVault seven hundred and th irteen had no keyhole. \n\u201cStand back,\u201d said Griphook im portantly.

Tell yeh what, I\u2019ll get yer animal. Not a \ntoad, toads went outta fashion year s ago, yeh\u2019d be laughed at \u2014 an\u2019 \nI don\u2019 like cats, they make me sneeze. I\u2019ll get yer an owl. All the kids \nwant owls, they\u2019re dead useful, carry yer mail an\u2019 everythin\u2019.\u201d \nTwenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which \nhad been dark and full of rustling and flickering, jewel-bright eyes. \nHarry now carried a large cage that held a beautiful snowy owl, fast \nasleep with her head under her wi ng. He couldn\u2019t stop stammering \nhis thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell. \n\u201cDon\u2019 mention it,\u201d said Hagrid gr uffly. \u201cDon\u2019 expect you\u2019ve had \na lotta presents from them Dursle ys.

A \nsingle wand lay on a faded purple cushion in the dusty window. \nA tinkling bell rang somewhere in the depths of the shop as they \nstepped inside. It was a tiny pl ace, empty except for a single, \nspindly chair that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry felt strangely as \nthough he had entered a very strict library; he swallowed a lot of \nnew questions that had just occurr ed to him and looked instead at \nthe thousands of narrow boxes piled neatly right up to the ceiling. \nFor some reason, the back of his neck prickled. The very dust and \nsilence in here seemed to ting le with some secret magic. \n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d said a soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid \nmust have jumped, too, because there was a loud crunching noise \nand he got quickly of f the spindly chair. \nAn old man was standing before them, his wide, pa le eyes shin-\ning like moons through the gloom of the shop. \n\u201cHello,\u201d said Harry awkwardly. \u201cAh yes,\u201d said the man. \u201cYes, yes.

Those silvery ey es were a bit creepy. \n\u201cYour father, on the other ha nd, favored a mahogany wand. \nEleven inches. Pliable. A little mo re power and excellent for trans-\nfiguration.

Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, \nand in the wrong hands . . . well, if I\u2019d known what that wand was \ngoing out into the wo rld to do. . . .\u201d \nHe shook his head and then, to Harry\u2019s relief, spotted Hagrid. \u201cRubeus! Rubeus Hagrid ! How nice to see you again. . . . Oak, \nsixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\u201cIt was, sir, yes,\u201d said Hagrid. \n\u201cGood wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it in half \nwhen you got expelled?\u201d said Mr .

Harry noticed he gripped his \npink umbrella very ti ghtly as he spoke. \n\u201cHmmm,\u201d said Mr. Ollivander, gi ving Hagrid a piercing look. \n\u201cWell, now \u2014 Mr. Potter.

And of course, \nyou will never get such good results with another wizard\u2019s wand.\u201d \nHarry suddenly realized that the tape measure, which was mea-\nsuring between his nostrils, was doing this on its own.

Hagrid whooped and clap ped and Mr. Ollivander cried, \n\u201cOh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well . . . how curious . . . how very curious . . .\u201d \nHe put Harry\u2019s wand back into its box and wrapped it in brown \npaper, still muttering, \u201cCur ious . . . curious . . .\u201d \n\u201cSorry,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut what\u2019s curious?\u201d \nMr. Ollivander fixed Harr y with his pale stare. \n\u201cI remember every wand I\u2019ve ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single \nwand. It so happens that the phoeni x whose tail feather is in your \nwand, gave another feather \u2014 just one other.

After \nall, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things \u2014 terrible, yes, but great.\u201d \nHarry shivered. He wasn\u2019t sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too \nmuch.

Half terrified, half \nfurious, they acted as though an y chair with Harry in it were \nempty. Although this was an improvement in many ways, it did be-come a bit depressing after a while. \nHarry kept to his room, with hi s new owl for company. He had \ndecided to call her Hedwig, a name he had found in A History of \nMagic. His school books were very in teresting.

He was \nstarting to attract a lot of funny looks, because of Hedwig. He\u2019d \nhave to ask someone. \nHe stopped a passing guard, but didn\u2019t dare mention platform \nnine and three-quarters. The guard had never heard of Hogwarts \nand when Harry couldn\u2019t even tell hi m what part of the country it \nwas in, he started to get annoyed, as though Harr y was being stu-\npid on purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked for the train that \nleft at eleven o\u2019clock, but the guar d said there wasn\u2019t one. In the end \nthe guard strode away, mutterin g about time wasters. Harry was \nnow trying hard not to panic.

While you are at Hog-\nwarts, your triumphs will earn yo ur House points, while any rule-\nbreaking will lose House points.

They finally \nmanaged to find their way down to the Great Hall for breakfast \nwithout getting lost once. \n\u201cWhat have we got today?\u201d Harry asked Ron as he poured sugar \non his porridge. \n\u201cDouble Potions with the Slytherins,\u201d said Ron. \u201cSnape\u2019s Head \nof Slytherin House. They say he al ways favors them \u2014 we\u2019ll be able \nto see if it\u2019s true.\u201d \n\u201cWish McGonagall favored us,\u201d said Harry. Professor McGona-\ngall was head of Gryffindor House, but it hadn\u2019t stopped her from \ngiving them a huge pile of homework the day before. \nJust then, the mail arrived. Ha rry had gotten used to this by \nnow, but it had given him a bit of a shock on the first morning, \nwhen about a hundred owls had suddenly streamed into the Great \nHall during breakfast, circling the tables until they saw their own-\ners, and dropping letters an d packages onto their laps. \nHedwig hadn\u2019t brought Harry an ything so far. She sometimes \nflew in to nibble his ear and have a bit of toast before going off to \nsleep in the owlery with the other school owls. This morning, how-\never, she fluttered down between the marmalade and the sugar \nbowl and dropped a note onto Harry\u2019s plate. Harry tore it open at once. It said, in a very untidy scrawl: \n \nDear Harry, \nI know you get Friday aftern oons off so would you like \nto come and have a cup of tea with me around three?"

Send us an \nanswer back with Hedwig. \nHagrid \n \nHarry borrowed Ron\u2019s quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later on \nthe back of the note, and sent Hedwig off again. \nIt was lucky that Harry had tea wi th Hagrid to look forward to, \nbecause the Potions lesson turned out to be the worst thing that \nhad happened to him so far. \nAt the start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten the idea that \nProfessor Snape disliked him. By the end of the first Potions lesson, \nhe knew he\u2019d been wrong. Sn ape didn\u2019t dislike Harry \u2014 he hated \nhim. \nPotions lessons took place down in one of the dungeons. It was \ncolder here than up in the main castle, and would have been quite \ncreepy enough without the pickled an imals floating in glass jars all \naround the walls. \nSnape, like Flitwick, started the class by taking the roll call, and \nlike Flitwick, he paus ed at Harry\u2019s name. \n\u201cAh, yes,\u201d he said softly, \u201cHarry Potter. Our new \u2014 celebrity. \u201d \nDraco Malfoy and his friends Cr abbe and Goyle sniggered be-\nhind their hands. Snape finished calling the names and looked up \nat the class. His eyes were black like Hagrid\u2019s, but they had none of \nHagrid\u2019s warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think \nof dark tunnels. \n\u201cYou are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potion-\nmaking,\u201d he began. He spoke in barely more than a whisper, but \nthey caught every word \u2014 like Professor McGonagall, Snape had \n \nTHE POTIONS MASTER \n\u0091 137 \u0091 the gift of keeping a class silent without effort. \u201cAs there is little \nfoolish wand-waving here, many of you will hardly believe this is \nmagic. I don\u2019t expect you will really understand the beauty of the \nsoftly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate \npower of liquids that creep thro ugh human veins, bewitching the \nmind, ensnaring the senses. . . . I can teach you how to bottle fame, \nbrew glory, even stopper death \u2014 if you aren\u2019t as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach.\u201d \nMore silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron ex-\nchanged looks with raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on the \nedge of her seat and looked desp erate to start proving that she \nwasn\u2019t a dunderhead. \n\u201cPotter!\u201d said Snape suddenly. \u201cWhat would I get if I added \npowdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?\u201d \nPowdered root of what to an infusion of what ? Harry glanced at \nRon, who looked as stumped as he was; Hermione\u2019s hand had shot \ninto the air. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir,\u201d said Harry. Snape\u2019s lips curled into a sneer. \n\u201cTut, tut \u2014 fame clearly isn\u2019t everything.\u201d \nHe ignored Hermione\u2019s hand. \n\u201cLet\u2019s try again. Potter, where wo uld you look if I told you to \nfind me a bezoar?\u201d \nHermione stretched her hand as high into the air as it would go \nwithout her leaving her seat, but Ha rry didn\u2019t have the faintest idea \nwhat a bezoar was. He tried not to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking with laughter. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know, sir.\u201d"

He had looked through his books at the Dursleys\u2019, but did \nSnape expect him to remember everything in One Thousand Mag-\nical Herbs and Fungi ? \nSnape was still ignoring He rmione\u2019s quivering hand. \n\u201cWhat is the differen ce, Potter, between monkshood and wolfs-\nbane?\u201d \nAt this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward the \ndungeon ceiling. \n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said Harry quietly. \u201cI think Hermione does, \nthough, why don\u2019t you try her?\u201d \nA few people laughed; Harry caug ht Seamus\u2019s eye, and Seamus \nwinked.

Snape put them all into pairs and set them to mixing up a simple potion to cure boils.

Neville had somehow managed \nto melt Seamus\u2019s cauldron into a twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across the stone floor, burning holes in people\u2019s shoes. Within seconds, the whole class wa s standing on their stools while \nNeville, who had been drenched in the potion when the cauldron \ncollapsed, moaned in pain as angry red boils sp rang up all over his \narms and legs. \n\u201cIdiot boy!\u201d snarled Snape, cleari ng the spilled potion away with \none wave of his wand. \u201cI suppose you added the porcupine quills \nbefore taking the caul dron off the fire?\u201d \nNeville whimpered as boils starte d to pop up all over his nose. \n\u201cTake him up to the hospital wing ,\u201d Snape spat at Seamus. Then \nhe rounded on Harry and Ron, who had been working next to \nNeville. \n\u201cYou \u2014 Potter \u2014 why didn\u2019t you tell him not to add the quills? \nThought he\u2019d make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? \nThat\u2019s another point you\u2019ve lost for Gryffindor.\u201d \nThis was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth to argue, but \nRon kicked him behi nd their cauldron. \n\u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d he muttered, \u201cI\u2019ve heard Snape can turn very \nnasty.\u201d \nAs they climbed the steps out of the dungeon an hour later, \nHarry\u2019s mind was racing and his sp irits were low.

He complained \nloudly about first years never getting on the House Quidditch \nteams and told long, boastful stor ies that always seemed to end \nwith him narrowly escaping Muggles in helicopters. He wasn\u2019t the \nonly one, though: the way Seamus Fi nnigan told it, he\u2019d spent most \nof his childhood zooming around the countryside on his broom-\nstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who\u2019d listen about the time he\u2019d \nalmost hit a hang glider on Charlie\u2019s old broom. Everyone from \nwizarding families talked about Quidditch constantly. Ron had al-\nready had a big argument with Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, about soccer. Ron couldn\u2019t see what was exciting about \na game with only one ball where no one was allowed to fly. Harry \nhad caught Ron prodding Dean\u2019s poster of West Ham soccer team, \ntrying to make the players move. \nNeville had never been on a broom stick in his life, because his \ngrandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she\u2019d \nhad good reason, because Neville managed to have an extraordi-\nnary number of accidents even wi th both feet on the ground. \nHermione Granger was almost as nervous about flying as Neville \nwas. This was something you couldn\u2019t learn by heart out of a book \u2014 not that she hadn\u2019t tried. At breakfast on Thursday she \nbored them all stupid with flying tips she\u2019d gotten out of a library \nbook called Quidditch Through the Ages.

He wa s going to be expelled, he just \nknew it. He wanted to say someth ing to defend himself, but there \nseemed to be something wrong wi th his voice. Professor McGona-\ngall was sweeping along without even looking at him; he had to jog \nto keep up. Now he\u2019d done it. He hadn\u2019t even lasted two weeks. \nHe\u2019d be packing his bags in ten minutes. What would the Dursleys \nsay when he turned up on the doorstep? \nUp the front steps, up the marble staircase inside, and still Pro-\nfessor McGonagall didn\u2019t say a wo rd to him. She wrenched open \ndoors and marched along corridors with Harry trotting miserably \nbehind her. Maybe she was taking him to Dumbledore. He thought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed to stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps \nhe could be Hagrid\u2019s assistant. Hi s stomach twisted as he imagined \nit, watching Ron and the others becoming wizards while he \nstumped around the grounds carrying Hagrid\u2019s bag. \nProfessor McGonagall stopped outside a classroom. She opened \nthe door and poked her head inside. \n\u201cExcuse me, Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a mo-\nment?\u201d \nWood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she was go-\ning to use on him? \nBut Wood turned out to be a pers on, a burly fifth-year boy who \ncame out of Flitwick\u2019s class looking confused. \n \nTHE MIDNIGHT DUEL \n\u0091 151 \u0091 \u201cFollow me, you two,\u201d said Professor McGonagall, and they \nmarched on up the co rridor, Wood looking curiously at Harry. \n\u201cIn here.\u201d \nProfessor McGonagall pointed th em into a classroom that was \nempty except for Peeves, who was busy writing rude words on the \nblackboard. \n\u201cOut, Peeves!\u201d she barked. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, \nwhich clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed the door behind him and turned to face the \ntwo boys. \n\u201cPotter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood \u2014 I\u2019ve found you a Seeker.\u201d \nWood\u2019s expression ch anged from puzzleme nt to delight. \n\u201cAre you serious, Professor?\u201d \n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d said Professor McGo nagall crisply. \u201cThe boy\u2019s a \nnatural. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. Was that your first time on \na broomstick, Potter?\u201d \nHarry nodded silently. He didn\u2019t ha ve a clue what was going on, \nbut he didn\u2019t seem to be being expelled, and some of the feeling \nstarted coming back to his legs. \n\u201cHe caught that thing in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,\u201d Profes-\nsor McGonagall told Wood. \u201cDidn\u2019t even scratch himself.

Filch must have hur-\nried off to look for them somewh ere else, because they didn\u2019t see \nhim anywhere, but they hardly cared \u2014 all they wanted to do was \nput as much space as possible between them and that monster. \nThey didn\u2019t stop running until they reached the portrait of the Fat \nLady on the seventh floor. \n\u201cWhere on earth have you all been ?\u201d she asked, looking at their \nbathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces. \n\u201cNever mind that \u2014 pig snout, pig snout,\u201d panted Harry, and \nthe portrait swung forward. They scrambled into the common \nroom and collapsed, trem bling, into armchairs. \nIt was a while before any of them said anything.

All Neville cared \nabout was never going near the dog again. \nHermione was now refusing to sp eak to Harry and Ron, but she \nwas such a bossy know-it-all that they saw this as an added bonus. \nAll they really wanted now was a wa y of getting back at Malfoy, and \nto their great delight, just such a thing arrived in the mail about a \nweek later. \nAs the owls flooded into the Grea t Hall as usual, everyone\u2019s at-\ntention was caught at once by a long, thin package carried by six \nlarge screech owls. Harry wa s just as interested as everyone else to \nsee what was in this large parcel , and was amazed when the owls \nsoared down and dropped it right in front of him, knocking his ba-\ncon to the floor. They had hardly fluttered out of the way when an-\nother owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel. \nHarry ripped open the letter first, which was lucky, because it \nsaid: \n \nDO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE TABLE. \nIt contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don\u2019t want everybody knowing you\u2019ve got a broomstick or they\u2019ll \nall want one.

Malfoy \nseized the package from Harry and felt it. \n\u201cThat\u2019s a broomstick,\u201d he said, thro wing it back to Harry with a \nmixture of jealousy and spite on his face. \u201cYou\u2019ll be in for it this time, Potter, first years aren\u2019t allowed them.\u201d \nRon couldn\u2019t resist it. \u201cIt\u2019s not any old broomstick,\u201d he said, \u201cit\u2019s a Nimbus Two Thou-\nsand. What did you say you\u2019ve go t at home, Malfoy, a Comet Two \nSixty?\u201d Ron grinned at Harry. \u201cCom ets look flashy, but they\u2019re not \nin the same league as the Nimbus.\u201d \n\u201cWhat would you know about it, Weasley, you couldn\u2019t afford \nhalf the handle,\u201d Malfoy snapped back. \u201cI suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig.\u201d \nBefore Ron could answer, Profes sor Flitwick appeared at Mal-\nfoy\u2019s elbow. \n\u201cNot arguing, I hope, boys?\u201d he squeaked. \n\u201cPotters been sent a broomstick, Professor,\u201d said Malfoy quickly. \n\u201cYes, yes, that\u2019s right,\u201d said Pr ofessor Flitwick, beaming at Harry. \n\u201cProfessor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances, Potter.

It kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broom-\nstick was lying under his bed, or straying off to the Quidditch \nfield where he\u2019d be learning to play that night. He bolted his din-\nner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then \nrushed upstairs with Ron to unwr ap the Nimbus Two Thousand at \nlast. \n\u201cWow,\u201d Ron sighed, as the broom stick rolled onto Harry\u2019s bed-\nspread. \nEven Harry, who knew nothin g about the different brooms, \nthought it looked wonderful. Sl eek and shiny, with a mahogany \nhandle, it had a long tail of ne at, straight twigs and Nimbus Two \nThousand written in gold near the top. \nAs seven o\u2019clock drew nearer, Har ry left the castle and set off in \nthe dusk toward the Quidditch fiel d. He\u2019d never been inside the \nstadium before. Hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the \nfield so that the spectators were high enough to s ee what was going \non. At either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on \nthe end. They reminded Harry of the little plastic sticks Muggle \n \nHALLOWEEN \n\u0091 167 \u0091 children blew bubbles through, ex cept that they were fifty feet \nhigh. \nToo eager to fly again to wait for Wood, Harry mounted his \nbroomstick and kicked off from the ground. What a feeling \u2014 he \nswooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down \nthe field. The Nimbus Two Thousa nd turned wherever he wanted \nat his lightest touch. \n\u201cHey, Potter, come down!\u201d Oliver Wood had arrived. He was carrying a large wooden crate \nunder his arm. Harry landed next to him. \n\u201cVery nice,\u201d said Wood, his eyes glinting. \u201cI see what McGona-\ngall meant . . . you really are a natural. I\u2019m just going to teach you \nthe rules this evening, then you\u2019ll be joining team practice three \ntimes a week.\u201d \nHe opened the crate. Inside we re four different-sized balls. \n\u201cRight,\u201d said Wood. \u201cNow, Quidditch is easy enough to under-\nstand, even if it\u2019s not too easy to play. There are seven players on \neach side. Three of them are called Chasers.\u201d \n\u201cThree Chasers,\u201d Harry repeated, as Wood took out a bright red \nball about the size of a soccer ball. \n\u201cThis ball\u2019s called th e Quaffle,\u201d said Wood. \u201cThe Chasers throw \nthe Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the \nhoops to score a goal. Ten points every time the Quaffle goes \nthrough one of the hoops. Follow me?\u201d \n\u201cThe Chasers throw the Quaffle an d put it through the hoops to \nscore,\u201d Harry recited. \u201cSo \u2014 that\u2019s sort of like basketball on \nbroomsticks with six hoops, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s basketball?\u201d said Wood curiously."

Okay, got that. \nSo what are they for?\u201d He pointed at the three balls left inside the \nbox. \n\u201cI\u2019ll show you now,\u201d said Wood. \u201cTake this.\u201d He handed Harry a small club, a bit like a short baseball bat. \n\u201cI\u2019m going to show you what the Bludgers do,\u201d Wood said. \n\u201cThese two are the Bludgers.\u201d \nHe showed Harry two identical balls, jet blac k and slightly \nsmaller than the red Quaffle.

That\u2019s why you have two \nBeaters on each team \u2014 the Weasle y twins are ours \u2014 it\u2019s their job \nto protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them \ntoward the other team.

We\u2019ve had a couple of broken jaws but \nnothing worse than that. Now, the last member of the team is the \nSeeker. That\u2019s you. And you don\u2019t have to worry about the Quaffle \nor the Bludgers \u2014\u201d \n\u201c\u2014 unless they crack my head open.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry, the Weasleys are more than a match for the \nBludgers \u2014 I mean, they\u2019re like a pair of human Bludgers them-\nselves.\u201d \nWood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last \nball. Compared with the Quaffle and the Bludgers, it was tiny, \nabout the size of a larg e walnut. It was bright gold and had little \nfluttering silver wings. \n\u201cThis, \u201d said Wood, \u201cis the Golden Sn itch, and it\u2019s the most im-\nportant ball of the lot. It\u2019s very ha rd to catch because it\u2019s so fast and \ndifficult to see. It\u2019s the Seeker\u2019s jo b to catch it. You\u2019ve got to weave \nin and out of the Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it \nbefore the other team\u2019s Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches \nthe Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they \nnearly always win. That\u2019s why Seekers get fouled so much. A game of Quidditch only ends when the Snit ch is caught, so it can go on \nfor ages \u2014 I think the record is three months, they had to keep \nbringing on substitu tes so the players co uld get some sleep."

The troll didn\u2019t even seem to notice \nthe pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard the yell and paused again, \nturning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time to \nrun around it. \n\u201cCome on, run, run!\u201d Harry yelled at Hermione, trying to pull \nher toward the door, but she couldn\u2019t move, she was still flat against \nthe wall, her mouth open with terror. \nThe shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll"

The troll couldn\u2019t feel Harry \nhanging there, but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of \nwood up its nose, and Harry\u2019s wand had still been in his hand when \nhe\u2019d jumped \u2014 it had gone straight up one of the troll\u2019s nostrils. \nHowling with pain, the troll twisted and flailed its club, with \nHarry clinging on for dear life; any second, the troll was going to \nrip him off or catch him a te rrible blow wi th the club. \nHermione had sunk to the floor in fright ; Ron pulled out his \nown wand \u2014 not knowing what he was going to do he heard him-\nself cry the first spell that came into his head: \u201c Wingardium \nLeviosa !\u201d \nThe club flew suddenly out of th e troll\u2019s hand, rose high, high \nup into the air, turned slowly ov er \u2014 and dropped, with a sicken-\ning crack, onto its owner\u2019s head. The troll swayed on the spot and \nthen fell flat on its face, with a thud that made the whole room \ntremble. \nHarry got to his feet. He was shaking and out of breath. Ron was \nstanding there with his wand stil l raised, staring at what he had \ndone. \nIt was Hermione who spoke first. \u201cIs it \u2014 dead?\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI think it\u2019s just been knocked out.\u201d \nHe bent down and pulled his wand out of the troll\u2019s nose.

They hadn\u2019t realized what a racket they had been making, \nbut of course, someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll\u2019s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape, with Quirrell \nbringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a \nfaint whimper, and sat quickly do wn on a toilet, clutching his \nheart. \nSnape bent over the troll. Pro fessor McGonagall was looking at \nRon and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips \nwere white. Hopes of winning fi fty points for Gryffindor faded \nquickly from Harry\u2019s mind. \n\u201cWhat on earth were you thinking of?\u201d said Professor McGona-\ngall, with cold fury in her voice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still \nstanding with his wand in the air. \u201cYou\u2019re lucky you weren\u2019t killed. \nWhy aren\u2019t you in your dormitory?\u201d \nSnape gave Harry a swift, pierci ng look.

The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating \nthe food that had been sent up. He rmione, however, stood alone by \nthe door, waiting for them. There was a very embarrassed pause. \nThen, none of them looking at each other, they all said \u201cThanks,\u201d \nand hurried off to get plates. \nBut from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their \nfriend. There are some things yo u can\u2019t share without ending up \nliking each other, and knocking ou t a twelve-foot mountain troll is \none of them. \nC H A P T E R E L E V E N \n \n\u0091 180 \u0091 QUIDDITCH \n \n \n \ns they entered November, the weather turned very cold. The \nmountains around the school became icy gray and the \nlake like chilled steel. Every morning the ground was covered in frost. Hagrid could be seen from the upstairs windows defrost-\ning broomsticks on the Quidditch field, bundled up in a long \nmoleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin \nboots. \nThe Quidditch season had begun. On Saturday, Harry would be \nplaying in his first match after weeks of training: Gryffindor versus \nS l y t h e r i n . I f G r y f f i n d o r w o n , t h e y w o u l d m o v e u p i n t o s e c o n d \nplace in the House Championship. \nHardly anyone had seen Harry pl ay because Wood had decided \nthat, as their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But \nthe news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and \nHarry didn\u2019t know which was worse \u2014 people telling him he\u2019d be \n A \nQUIDDITCH \n\u0091 181 \u0091 brilliant or people te lling him they\u2019d be running around under-\nneath him holding a mattress. \nIt was really lucky that Harry no w had Hermione as a friend. He \ndidn\u2019t know how he\u2019d have gotten through all his homework with-\nout her, what with all the last -minute Quidditch practice Wood \nwas making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through the \nAges, which turned out to be a very interesting read. \nHarry learned that there were seven hundred ways of commit-\nting a Quidditch foul and that al l of them had happened during a \nWorld Cup match in 1473; that S eekers were usually the smallest \nand fastest players, and that mo st serious Quidditch accidents \nseemed to happen to them; that although people rarely died play-\ning Quidditch, referees had been known to vanish and turn up \nmonths later in th e Sahara Desert. \nHermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules \nsince Harry and Ron had saved her from the mountain troll, and \nshe was much nicer for it. The day before Harry\u2019s first Quidditch \nmatch the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during \nbreak, and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could \nbe carried around in a jam jar. Th ey were standing with their backs \nto it, getting warm, when Snape cr ossed the yard. Harry noticed at \nonce that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved \ncloser together to block the fire from view; they were sure it \nwouldn\u2019t be allowed. Unfortunatel y, something about their guilty \nfaces caught Snape\u2019s eye. He limp ed over. He hadn\u2019t seen the fire, \nbut he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that you\u2019ve got there, Potter?\u201d \nIt was Quidditch Through the Ages.

His broom gave a sud-\nden, frightening lurch. For a spli t second, he thought he was going \nto fall. He gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and \nknees. He\u2019d never felt anything like that. \nIt happened again. It was as though the broom was trying to \nbuck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly de-\ncide to buck their riders off. Ha rry tried to turn back toward the \nGryffindor goal posts \u2014 he had ha lf a mind to ask Wood to call \ntime-out \u2014 and then he realized that his broom was completely \nout of his control. He couldn\u2019t turn it . He couldn\u2019t direct it at all. It \nwas zigzagging through the air, an d every now and then making vi-\nolent swishing movements that almost unseated him. \nLee was still commentating. \n\u201cSlytherin in possession \u2014 Fl int with the Quaffle \u2014 passes \nSpinnet \u2014 passes Bell \u2014 hit hard in the face by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose \u2014 only joking, Pr ofessor \u2014 Slytherins score \u2014 oh \nno . . .\u201d \nThe Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed to have noticed \nthat Harry\u2019s broom was behaving strangely It wa s carrying him \nslowly higher, away from the ga me, jerking and twitching as it \nwent. \n\u201cDunno what Harry thinks he\u2019s doing,\u201d Hagrid mumbled. He \nstared through his binoculars. \u201cIf I didn\u2019 know better, I\u2019d say he\u2019d lost control of his broom . . . but he can\u2019t have. . . .\u201d \nSuddenly, people were pointing up at Harry all over the stands."

One morning in mid-December, Hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow. \nThe lake froze solid and the Weasley twins were punished for be-witching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, \nbouncing off the back of his turb an. The few owls that managed to \nbattle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be \nnursed back to health by Hagrid before they could fly off again. \nNo one could wait for the holida ys to start. While the Gryf-\nfindor common room and the Great Hall had roaring fires, the \ndrafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the \nwindows in the classrooms. Worst of all were Professor Snape\u2019s \nclasses down in the dungeons, where their breath rose in a mist \nbefore them and they kept as clos e as possible to their hot caul-\ndrons. \n\u201cI do feel so sorry,\u201d said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, \u201cfor all \n C \nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \n\u0091 195 \u0091 those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because \nthey\u2019re not wanted at home.\u201d \nHe was looking over at Harry as he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle \nchuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine of lion-\nfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than \nusual since the Quidditch match. Di sgusted that the Slytherins had \nlost, he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a wide-mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry as Seeker next. Then he\u2019d real-\nized that nobody found this funn y, because they were all so im-\npressed at the way Harry had mana ged to stay on his bucking \nbroomstick. So Malfoy, jealous an d angry, had gone back to taunt-\ning Harry about having no proper family. \nIt was true that Harry wasn\u2019t going back to Privet Drive for \nChristmas. Professor McGonagall had come around the week be-\nfore, making a list of students who would be staying for the holi-\ndays, and Harry had signed up at once. He didn\u2019t feel sorry for \nhimself at all; this would probably be the best Christmas he\u2019d ever \nhad. Ron and his brothers were st aying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. \nWeasley were going to Romania to visit Charlie. \nWhen they left the dungeons at the end of Potions, they found \na large fir tree blocking the co rridor ahead. Two enormous feet \nsticking out at the bottom and a lo ud puffing sound told them that \nHagrid was behind it. \n\u201cHi, Hagrid, want any help?\u201d Ron asked, sticking his head \nthrough the branches. \n\u201cNah, I\u2019m all right, thanks, Ron.\u201d \n\u201cWould you mind moving out of the way?\u201d came Malfoy\u2019s cold \ndrawl from behind them. \u201cAre you trying to earn some extra"

Harry wandered over to \nthe Restricted Section. He had been wondering for a while if \nFlamel wasn\u2019t somewhere in there. Unfortunately, you needed a specially signed note from one of th e teachers to look in any of the \nrestricted books, and he knew he \u2019d never get one. These were the \nbooks containing powerful Dark Magic never taught at Hogwarts, \nand only read by older studen ts studying advanced Defense \nAgainst the Dark Arts. \n\u201cWhat are you looking for, boy?\u201d \n\u201cNothing,\u201d said Harry. Madam Pince the librarian brandish ed a feather duster at him. \n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out, then. Go on \u2014 out!\u201d \nWishing he\u2019d been a bit quicker at thinking up some story, \nHarry left the library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed \nthey\u2019d better not ask Madam Pinc e where they could find Flamel. \nThey were sure she\u2019d be able to tell them, but they couldn\u2019t risk \nSnape hearing what they were up to. \nHarry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had \nfound anything, but he wasn\u2019t very hopeful. They had been look-\ning for two weeks, after all, but as they only had odd moments be-\ntween lessons it wasn\u2019t surprising they\u2019d found not hing. What they \nreally needed was a nice long search without Madam Pince breath-ing down their necks. \nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \n\u0091 199 \u0091 Five minutes later, Ron and He rmione joined him, shaking their \nheads. They went off to lunch. \n\u201cYou will keep looking while I\u2019m away, won\u2019t you?\u201d said \nHermione. \u201cAnd send me an owl if you find anything.\u201d \n\u201cAnd you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,\u201d \nsaid Ron. \u201cIt\u2019d be safe to ask them.\u201d \n\u201cVery safe, as they\u2019re both dentists,\u201d said Hermione. \n \nOnce the holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too \ngood a time to think much abou t Flamel. They had the dormitory \nto themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual, \nso they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire. They sat by \nthe hour eating anything they co uld spear on a toasting fork \u2014 \nbread, English muffins, marshmallows \u2014 and plotting ways of get-ting Malfoy expelled, which were fun to talk about even if they \nwouldn\u2019t work. \nRon also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly \nlike Muggle chess except that the figures were alive, which made \nit a lot like directing troops in battle. Ron\u2019s set was very old and battered.

Harry pi cked it up and felt it. It was \nvery light. He unwrapped it. \nSomething fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor \nwhere it lay in gleami ng folds.

Had it really once belonged to his father? \nBefore he could say or think anything else, the dormitory door \nwas flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry \nstuffed the cloak quickly out of sigh t. He didn\u2019t feel like sharing it \nwith anyone else yet. \n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d \n\u201cHey, look \u2014 Harry\u2019s got a Weasley sweater, too!\u201d \nFred and George were wearing bl ue sweaters, one with a large \nyellow F on it, the other a G. \n\u201cHarry\u2019s is better than ours, though,\u201d said Fred, holding up \nHarry\u2019s sweater. \u201cShe obviously makes more of an effort if you\u2019re \nnot family.\u201d \n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you wearing yours, Ron?\u201d George demanded. \n\u201cCome on, get it on, they\u2019re lovely and warm.\u201d \n\u201cI hate maroon,\u201d Ron moaned half heartedly as he pulled it over \nhis head. \n\u201cYou haven\u2019t got a letter on your s,\u201d George observed. \u201cI suppose \nshe thinks you don\u2019t forget your name. But we\u2019re not stupid \u2014 we \nknow we\u2019re called Gred and Forge.\u201d \nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \n\u0091 203 \u0091 \u201cWhat\u2019s all this noise?\u201d \nPercy Weasley stuck his head th rough the door, looking disap-\nproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his \npresents as he, too, carried a lu mpy sweater over his arm, which \nFred seized. \n\u201cP for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we\u2019re all wearing ours, \neven Harry got one.\u201d \n\u201cI \u2014 don\u2019t \u2014 want \u2014\u201d said Perc y thickly, as the twins forced \nthe sweater over his head, kn ocking his glasses askew. \n\u201cAnd you\u2019re not sitting with the prefects today, either,\u201d said \nGeorge. \u201cChristmas is a time for family.\u201d \nThey frog-marched Percy from the room, his arms pinned to his \nside by his sweater. \n \nHarry had never in all his life ha d such a Christmas dinner. A hun-\ndred fat, roast turkeys; mountain s of roast and boiled potatoes; \nplatters of chipolatas; tureens of bu ttered peas, silver boats of thick, \nrich gravy and cranberry sauce \u2014 and stacks of wizard crackers \nevery few feet along the table. Th ese fantastic party favors were \nnothing like the feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usually bought, \nwith their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. \nHarry pulled a wizard cracker with Fr ed and it didn\u2019t just bang, it \nwent off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud \nof blue smoke, while from the in side exploded a rear admiral\u2019s hat \nand several live, whit e mice. Up at the Hi gh Table, Dumbledore \nhad swapped his pointe d wizard\u2019s hat for a flowered bonnet, and \nwas chuckling merrily at a joke Pro fessor Flitwick had just read him. \nFlaming Christmas puddings followed the turkey. Percy nearly \nbroke his teeth on a silver Sick le embedded in his slice. Harry"

Th e white mice had disappeared and \nHarry had a nasty feelin g they were going to end up as Mrs. Nor-\nris\u2019s Christmas dinner. \nHarry and the Weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furi-\nous snowball fight on the ground s. Then, cold, wet, and gasping \nfor breath, they returned to the fire in the Gryffindor common \nroom, where Harry broke in his ne w chess set by losing spectacu-\nlarly to Ron. He suspected he wouldn\u2019t have lost so badly if Percy \nhadn\u2019t tried to he lp him so much. \nAfter a meal of turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christ-\nmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chas e Fred and George all over \nGryffindor Tower because they\u2019d stolen his prefect badge. \nIt had been Harry\u2019s best Christ mas day ever. Yet something had \nbeen nagging at the back of his mi nd all day. Not until he climbed \ninto bed was he free to think abou t it: the Invisibility Cloak and \nwhoever had sent it. \nRon, full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to \nbother him, fell asleep almost as soon as he\u2019d drawn the curtains of his four-poster. Harry leaned ov er the side of his own bed and \npulled the cloak out from under it. \n \nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \n\u0091 205 \u0091 His father\u2019s . . . this had been his father\u2019s. He let the material \nflow over his hands, smoother than silk, light as air. Use it well, the \nnote had said. \nHe had to try it, now. He slip ped out of bed and wrapped the \ncloak around himself. Looking down at his legs, he saw only moon-\nlight and shadows. It was a very funny feeling. \nUse it well. \nSuddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole of Hogwarts was \nopen to him in this cloak. Exci tement flooded through him as he \nstood there in the dark and silence. He could go anywhere in this, \nanywhere, and Filch would never know. \nRon grunted in his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something \nheld him back \u2014 his fath er\u2019s cloak \u2014 he felt that this time \u2014 the \nfirst time \u2014 he wanted to use it alone. \nHe crept out of the dormitory, down the stairs, across the com-\nmon room, and climbed thro ugh the portrait hole. \n\u201cWho\u2019s there?\u201d squawked the Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He \nwalked quickly do wn the corridor. \nWhere should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. \nAnd then it came to him. The Re stricted Section in the library. \nHe\u2019d be able to read as long as he liked, as long as it took to find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing the Invisibility Cloak tight around him as he walked. \nThe library was pitch-black and ve ry eerie. Harry lit a lamp to \nsee his way along the rows of books. The lamp looked as if it was \nfloating along in midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm \nsupporting it, the sigh t gave him the creeps. \nThe Restricted Section was right at the back of the library.

Thei r peeling, faded gold letters \nspelled words in languages Harry couldn\u2019t understand. Some had \nno title at all. One book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly \nlike blood. The hairs on the back of Harry\u2019s neck prickled. Maybe \nhe was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books, as though they knew someone was \nthere who shouldn\u2019t be. \nHe had to start somewhere. Setting the lamp down carefully \non the floor, he looked along th e bottom shelf for an interesting-\nlooking book. A la rge black and silver volume caught his eye. He \npulled it out with difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balanc-\ning it on his knee, let it fall open. \nA piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split the silence \u2014 the book \nwas screaming! Harry sn apped it shut, but the shriek went on and \non, one high, unbroken, earsplitti ng note. He stumbled backward \nand knocked over his lamp, which w ent out at once. Panicking, he \nheard footsteps coming down the corridor outside \u2014 stuffing the \nshrieking book back on the shelf, he ran for it. He passed Filch in \nthe doorway; Filch\u2019s pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, \nand Harry slipped under Filch\u2019s outstretched arm and streaked off \nup the corridor, the book\u2019s shrieks still ringing in his ears. \nHe came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor. He had \nbeen so busy getting away from the library, he hadn\u2019t paid attention to where he was going. Perhaps be cause it was dark, he didn\u2019t rec-\nognize where he was at all. There was a suit of armor near the \nkitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there. \n \nTHE MIRROR OF ERISED \n\u0091 207 \u0091 \u201cYou asked me to come directly to you, Professor, if anyone was \nwandering around at night, and somebody\u2019s been in the library \u2014 \nRestricted Section.\u201d \nHarry felt the blood drain out of his face. Wherever he was, \nFilch must know a shortcut, becaus e his soft, greasy voice was get-\nting nearer, and to his horror, it was Snape who replied, \u201cThe Re-\nstricted Section? Well, they ca n\u2019t be far, we\u2019ll catch them.\u201d \nHarry stood rooted to the spot as Filch and Snape came around \nthe corner ahead. They couldn\u2019t se e him, of course, but it was a nar-\nrow corridor and if they came much nearer they\u2019d knock right into him \u2014 the cloak didn\u2019t stop him from being solid. \nHe backed away as quietly as he could. A door stood ajar to his \nleft. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his \nbreath, trying not to move it, and to his relief he managed to get in-\nside the room withou t their noticing anything. They walked \nstraight past, and Harry leaned ag ainst the wall, breathing deeply, \nlistening to their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very \nclose. It was a few seconds befo re he noticed anything about the \nroom he had hidden in. \nIt looked like an unused classroom. The dark shapes of desks \nand chairs were piled against the walls, and there was an upturned \nwastepaper basket \u2014 but propped against the wall facing him was something that didn\u2019t look as if it belonged there, something \nthat looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the \nway. \nIt was a magnificent mirror, as high as the ceiling, with an ornate \ngold frame, standing on two claw ed feet. There was an inscription \ncarved around the top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi."

He stepped in front of it. \nHe had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from \nscreaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed \u2014 for he had seen not \nonly himself in the mirror, but a whole crowd of people standing \nright behind him. \nBut the room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly \nback to the mirror. \nThere he was, reflected in it , white and scared-looking, and \nthere, reflected behind him, were at least ten others. Harry looked \nover his shoulder \u2014 but still, no one was there. Or were they all in-\nvisible, too? Was he in fact in a room full of invi sible people and \nthis mirrors trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not? \nHe looked in the mirror again. A woman standing right behind \nhis reflection was smiling at hi m and waving. He reached out a \nhand and felt the air behind him. If she was really there, he\u2019d touch \nher, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air \u2014 \nshe and the others existe d only in the mirror. \nShe was a very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her \neyes \u2014 her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging a little \ncloser to the glass. Bright green \u2014 exactly the same shape, but then \nhe noticed that she wa s crying; smiling, but crying at the same \ntime. The tall, thin, black-haired man standing next to her put his \narm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy.

He had a pow-\nerful kind of ache in side him, half joy, ha lf terrible sadness. \nHow long he stood there, he di dn\u2019t know. The reflections did \nnot fade and he looked and look ed until a distant noise brought \nhim back to his senses. He couldn\u2019t stay here, he had to find his way \nback to bed. He tore his eyes aw ay from his mother\u2019s face, whis-\npered, \u201cI\u2019ll come back,\u201d and hurried fr om the room. \n \n\u201cYou could have wo ken me up,\u201d said Ron, crossly. \n\u201cYou can come tonight, I\u2019m goin g back, I want to show you the \nmirror.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019d like to see your mom and dad,\u201d Ron said eagerly. \n\u201cAnd I want to see all your family, all the Weasleys, you\u2019ll be able \nto show me your other brothers and everyone.\u201d \n\u201cYou can see them any old time,\u201d said Ron. \u201cJust come round \nmy house this summer.

He\u2019d just gotten very angry \nwith the Weasleys, who kept di ve-bombing each other and pre-\ntending to fall off their brooms. \n\u201cWill you stop messing around!\u201d he yelled. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly \nthe sort of thing that\u2019ll lose us the match! Snape\u2019s refereeing this \ntime, and he\u2019ll be looking for an y excuse to knock points off \nGryffindor!\u201d \nGeorge Weasley really did fall off his broom at these words. \n\u201cSnape\u2019s refereeing?\u201d he spluttered through a mouthful of mud. \n\u201cWhen\u2019s he ever refere ed a Quidditch match? He\u2019s not going to be \nfair if we might ov ertake Slytherin.\u201d \nThe rest of the team landed next to George to complain, too. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not my fault,\u201d said Wood. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got to make sure we \nplay a clean game, so Snape hasn\u2019t got an excuse to pick on us.\u201d \nNICHOLAS FLAMEL \n\u0091 217 \u0091 Which was all very well , thought Harry, but he had another rea-\nson for not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quid-\nditch. . . . \nThe rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at \nthe end of practice, but Harry head ed straight back to the Gryf-\nfindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing \nchess. Chess was the only thing He rmione ever lost at, something \nHarry and Ron thought wa s very good for her. \n\u201cDon\u2019t talk to me for a moment ,\u201d said Ron when Harry sat \ndown next to him, \u201cI need to concen-\u201d He caught sight of \nHarry\u2019s face. \u201cWhat\u2019s th e matter with you? You look terrible.\u201d \nSpeaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told the \nother two about Snape\u2019s sudden, sini ster desire to be a Quidditch \nreferee. \n\u201cDon\u2019t play,\u201d said Hermione at once. \n\u201cSay you\u2019re ill,\u201d said Ron. \u201cPretend to break your leg,\u201d Hermione suggested. \n\u201cReally break your leg,\u201d said Ron. \n\u201cI can\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a reserve Seeker. If I back out, \nGryffindor can\u2019t play at all.\u201d \nAt that moment Neville toppled into the common room. How \nhe had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone\u2019s \nguess, because his legs had been stuck together with what they \nrecognized at once as the Leg-Lock er Curse. He must have had to \nbunny hop all the way up to Gryffindor Tower. \nEveryone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and \nperformed the countercurse. Neville\u2019 s legs sprang apart and he got \nto his feet, trembling."

At times, he \neven wondered whether Snape was following him, trying to catch \nhim on his own. Potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture, Snape was so horrible to Harry.

A couple of spar ks flew out of its snout. \n\u201cIsn\u2019t he beautiful ?\u201d Hagrid murmured. He reached out a hand \nto stroke the dragon\u2019s head.

As they \nstepped into the corridor, Filch\u2019s face loomed suddenly out of the \ndarkness. \n\u201cWell, well, well,\u201d he whispered, \u201cwe are in trouble.\u201d \nThey\u2019d left the Invisibility Cloak on top of the tower. \nC H A P T E R F I F T E E N \n \n\u0091 242 \u0091 THE FORBIDDEN FOREST \n \n \n \nhings couldn\u2019t ha ve been worse. \nFilch took them down to Professor McGonagall\u2019s study \non the first floor, where they sat and waited without saying a word \nto each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild \ncover-up stories chased each other around Harry\u2019s brain, each more \nfeeble than the last. He couldn\u2019t se e how they were going to get out \nof trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have \nbeen so stupid as to forget the cloak? There was no reason on earth \nthat Professor McGonagall would accept for their being out of bed \nand creeping around the school in the dead of nigh t, let alone be-\ning up the tallest Astronomy Towe r, which was out-of-bounds ex-\ncept for classes. Add Norbert and the Invisibility Cloak, and they might as well be packin g their bags already. \nHad Harry thought that t h i n g s c o u l d n \u2019 t h a v e b e e n w o r s e ? H e \nwas wrong. When Professor McGona gall appeared, she was leading \nNeville. T \nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST \n\u0091 243 \u0091 \u201cHarry!\u201d Neville burst out, the mo ment he saw the other two. \u201cI \nwas trying to find you to warn yo u, I heard Malfoy saying he was \ngoing to catch you, he said you had a drag \u2014\u201d \nHarry shook his head violently to shut Neville up, but Professor \nMcGonagall had seen. She looked mo re likely to br eathe fire than \nNorbert as she towered over the three of them. \n\u201cI would never have believed it of any of you. Mr. Filch says you \nwere up in the Astronomy Tower. It\u2019s one o\u2019clock in the morning. \nExplain yourselves. \u201d \nIt was the first time Hermione had ever failed to answer a \nteacher\u2019s question. She was staring at her slippers, as still as a statue. \n\u201cI think I\u2019ve got a good idea of what\u2019s been going on,\u201d said Pro-\nfessor McGonagall. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a genius to work it out. You fed \nDraco Malfoy some cock-and-bull story about a dragon, trying to \nget him out of bed and into trouble. I\u2019ve already caught him. I sup-\npose you think it\u2019s funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it, too?\u201d \nHarry caught Neville\u2019s eye and tr ied to tell him without words \nthat this wasn\u2019t true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville \u2014 Harry k n e w w h a t i t m u s t h a v e c o s t \nhim to try and find them in the dark, to warn them. \n\u201cI\u2019m disgusted,\u201d said Professor McGonagall. \u201cFour students out \nof bed in one night! I\u2019ve never he ard of such a t hing before! You, \nMiss Granger, I thought you had more sense. As for you, Mr. Pot-ter, I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this. All three of \nyou will receive detentions \u2014 yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, \nnothing gives you the right to walk around school at night, espe-\ncially these days, it\u2019s very danger ous \u2014 and fifty points will be \ntaken from Gryffindor.\u201d"

Harry couldn\u2019t think of any-thing to say to comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was \ndreading the dawn.

And th en the story started to spread: Harry Potter, \nthe famous Harry Potter, their hero of two Quidditch matches, had \nlost them all those points, him an d a couple of other stupid first \nyears. \nFrom being one of the most popu lar and admired people at the \nschool, Harry was suddenly the mo st hated. Even Ravenclaws and \nHufflepuffs turned on him, beca use everyone had been longing to \nsee Slytherin lose the House Cup. Everywhere Harry went, people \nTHE FORBIDDEN FOREST \n\u0091 245 \u0091 pointed and didn\u2019t trou ble to lower their voic es as they insulted \nhim.

He felt so ashamed \nof himself that he went to Wood and offered to resign from the \nQuidditch team. \n\u201cResign ?\u201d Wood thundered. \u201cWhat g ood\u2019ll that do?

Wa lking back from the library on \nhis own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering from a \nclassroom up ahead. As he drew closer, he heard Quirrell\u2019s voice. \n\u201cNo \u2014 no \u2014 not again, please \u2014\u201d It sounded as though someon e was threatening him.

At last, he said, \u201cThe \nforest hides many secrets.\u201d \nA movement in the trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his \nbow again, but it was only a second centaur, black-haired and -bodied and wilder-loo king than Ronan. \n\u201cHullo, Bane,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cAll right?\u201d \n\u201cGood evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?\u201d \u201cWell enough.

They had just passed a bend in the path when Her-\nmione grabbed Hagrid\u2019s arm. \n\u201cHagrid! Look!

Their ears seemed sharper than usual. \nHarry\u2019s seemed to be picking up every sigh of the wind, every \ncracking twig. What was going on? Where were the others? \nAt last, a great crunching noise announced Hagrid\u2019s return. Mal-\nfoy, Neville, and Fang were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, \nit seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him as a \njoke. Neville had panicked and sent up the sparks. \n\u201cWe\u2019ll be lucky ter catch anythin\u2019 now, with the racket you two \nwere makin\u2019.

They walked for nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper into \nthe forest, until the path became almost impossible to follow be-\ncause the trees were so thick. Ha rry thought the bl ood seemed to \nbe getting thicker. There were splashes on the roots of a tree, as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close \nby. Harry could see a clearing ahead, through the tangled branches of an ancient oak. \n\u201cLook \u2014\u201d he murmured, holding out his arm to stop Malfoy. \nSomething bright white was gl eaming on the ground. They \ninched closer. \nIt was the unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never \nseen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck"

A bush on the edge of the clear-\ning quivered. . . . Then, out of the shadows, a hooded figure came \ncrawling across the ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. The cloa ked figure reached the unicorn, \nlowered its head over the wound in the animals side, and began to \ndrink its blood. \n\u201cAAAAAAAAAAARGH!\u201d Malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted \u2014 so did Fang.

Yet \nthe days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still \nalive and well behind the locked door. \nIt was sweltering hot, especial ly in the large classroom where \nthey did their written papers. Th ey had been given special, new \nquills for the exams, which had been bewitched with an Anti-\nCheating spell. \nThey had practical exams as well. Professor Flitwick called them \none by one into his clas s to see if they could make a pineapple tap-\ndance across a desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn a mouse into a snuffbox \u2014 points were given for how pretty the snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them \nall nervous, breathing down their nec ks while they tried to remem-\nber how to make a Forgetfulness potion. I \nTHROUGH THE TRAPDOOR \n\u0091 263 \u0091 Harry did the best he could, trying to ignore the stabbing pains \nin his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip \ninto the forest. Neville thought Harry had a bad case of exam nerves because Harry couldn\u2019t sleep, but the truth was that Harry \nkept being woken by his old nigh tmare, except that it was now \nworse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood \nin it. \nMaybe it was because they hadn \u2019t seen what Harry had seen in \nthe forest, or because th ey didn\u2019t have scars burning on their fore-\nheads, but Ron and Hermione didn\u2019t seem as worried about the Stone as Harry. The idea of Vold emort certainly scared them, but \nhe didn\u2019t keep visiting them in dreams, and they were so busy with \ntheir studying they didn\u2019t have much time to fret about what Snape \nor anyone else might be up to. \nTheir very last exam was Histo ry of Magic. One hour of an-\nswering questions about batty old wizards who\u2019d invented self-\nstirring cauldrons and they\u2019d be free, free for a whole wonderful \nweek until their exam results came out. When the ghost of Profes-\nsor Binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn\u2019t he lp cheering wi th the rest. \n\u201cThat was far easier than I thought it would be,\u201d said Hermione \nas they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds. \u201cI \nneedn\u2019t have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or \nthe uprising of Elfric the Eager.\u201d \nHermione always liked to go through their exam papers after-\nward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down \nto the lake and flopped under a tree. The Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid, which was bask-\ning in the warm shallows."

Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself from \ntheir bodies, and they we re able to pull free. \n\u201cLucky you pay attention in Herbology, Hermione,\u201d said Harry \nas he joined her by the wall, wiping sweat off his face. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, \u201cand lucky Harry doesn\u2019t lose his head in a cri-\nsis \u2014 \u2018there\u2019s no wood,\u2019 honestly. \u201d \n\u201cThis way,\u201d said Harry, pointing down a stone passageway, which \nwas the only way forward. \nAll they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip \nof water trickling down the wall s. The passageway sloped down-\nward, and Harry was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpleasant \njolt of the heart, he remembered the dragons said to be guarding \nvaults in the wizards\u2019 bank.

It was \nfull of small, jewel-bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around \nthe room. On the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy \nwooden door. \n\u201cDo you think they\u2019ll attack us if we cross the room?\u201d said Ron. \n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Harry. \u201cThey don \u2019t look very vicious, but I sup-\npose if they all swooped down at once . . . well, there\u2019s no other \nchoice . . .

He expect ed to feel sharp beaks and claws \ntearing at him any second, but nothing happened. He reached the \ndoor untouched. He pulled the handle, but it was locked. \nThe other two followed him. They tugged and heaved at the \ndoor, but it wouldn\u2019t budge, no t even when Hermione tried her \nAlohomora Charm. \n\u201cNow what?\u201d said Ron. \n\u201cThese birds . . . they can\u2019t be here just for decoration,\u201d said \nHermione. \nThey watched the birds soaring overhead, glittering \u2014 glitter-\ning? \n\u201cThey\u2019re not birds!\u201d Harry said suddenly. \u201cThey\u2019re keys !

Ron and Hermione\u2019s cheers echoed \naround the high chamber. \nThey landed quickly, and Harry ran to the door, the key strug-\ngling in his hand.

The moment the lock had clicked open, the key took \nflight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice. \n\u201cReady?\u201d Harry asked the other two, his hand on the door han-\ndle. They nodded. He pulled the door open. \nThe next chamber was so dark they couldn\u2019t see anything at all. \nBut as they stepped into it, ligh t suddenly flooded the room to re-\nveal an astonishing sight. \nThey were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard, behind \nthe black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved \nfrom what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across the \nchamber, were the white pieces.

Should I \nbreak it?\u201d \nHarry\u2019s mind was racing. What I want more than anything else in th e world at the moment , \nhe thought, is to find the Stone before Qu irrell does. So if I look in \nthe mirror, I should see myself finding it \u2014 which means I\u2019ll see where \nit\u2019s hidden ! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I\u2019m \nup to ? \nHe tried to edge to the left, to get in front of the glass without \nQuirrell noticing, but the ropes ar ound his ankles we re too tight: \nhe tripped and fell over . Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking \nto himself."

Use the boy . . .\u201d \nQuirrell rounded on Harry. \u201cYes \u2014 Potter \u2014 come here.\u201d \nHe clapped his hands once, and th e ropes binding Harry fell off. \nHarry got slowly to his feet. \n\u201cCome here,\u201d Quirrell repeated. \u201cL ook in the mirror and tell me \nwhat you see.\u201d \nHarry walked toward him. \nI must lie, he thought desperately. I must look and lie about what \nI see, that\u2019s all. \nQuirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed in the funny \nsmell that seemed to come from Quirrell\u2019s turban. He closed his \neyes, stepped in fron t of the mirror, and opened them again. \nHe saw his reflection, pale and sc ared-looking at first. But a mo-\nment later, the reflection smiled at him. It put its hand into its \npocket and pulled out a blood-red stone. It winked and put the \nStone back in its pocket \u2014 and as it did so, Harry felt something \nheavy drop into his real pocket. Somehow \u2014 incredibly \u2014 he\u2019d \ngotten the Stone. \n\u201cWell?\u201d said Quirrell impa tiently. \u201cWhat do you see?\u201d \nHarry screwed up his courage. \n\u201cI see myself shaking hands wi th Dumbledore,\u201d he invented. \n\u201cI \u2014 I\u2019ve won the House Cup for Gryffindor.\u201d \nQuirrell cursed again. \n \nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES \n\u0091 293 \u0091 \u201cGet out of the way,\u201d he said.

He lies . . .\u201d \n\u201cPotter, come back here!\u201d Quirrell shouted. \u201cTell me the truth! \nWhat did you just see?\u201d \nThe high voice spoke again. \u201cLet me speak to him . . . face-to-face. . . .\u201d \n\u201cMaster, you are no t strong enough!\u201d \n\u201cI have strength enough . . . for this. . . .\u201d \nHarry felt as if Devil\u2019s Snare wa s rooting him to the spot. He \ncouldn\u2019t move a muscle. Petrified, he watched as Quirrell reached \nup and began to unwrap his turb an. What was going on? The tur-\nban fell away. Quirrell\u2019s head looked strangely small without it. \nThen he turned slowly on the spot. \nHarry would have screamed, but he couldn\u2019t make a sound. \nWhere there should have been a ba ck to Quirrell\u2019s head, there was \na face, the most terrible face Harr y had ever seen. It was chalk white \nwith glaring red eyes and slits for nostrils, like a snake. \n\u201cHarry Potter . . .\u201d it whispered. \nHarry tried to take a step backward but his legs wouldn\u2019t move. \n\u201cSee what I have become?\u201d the fa ce said. \u201cMere shadow and va-\npor . . .

The Snitch! He tried \nto catch it, but his arms were too heavy. \nHe blinked. It wasn\u2019t the Snitch at all. It was a pair of glasses. \nHow strange. \nHe blinked again.

If there is one thing Voldemort \ncannot understand, it is love. He didn\u2019t realize that love as power-ful as your mother\u2019s for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, no \nvisible sign . . . to ha ve been loved so deeply, even though the per-\nson who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is \nin your very skin.

A huge banner showing the Sl ytherin serpent covered the wall \nbehind the High Table. \nWhen Harry walked in there was a sudden hush, and then \neverybody started talking loudly at once. He slipped into a seat be-\ntween Ron and Hermione at the Gryffindor table and tried to ig-nore the fact that people were standing up to look at him. \nFortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. The babble \ndied away. \n\u201cAnother year gone!\u201d Dumbledore said cheerfully. \u201cAnd I must \ntrouble you with an old man\u2019s wheez ing waffle before we sink our \nteeth into our delicious feast.

Harry could see Draco Malf oy banging his goblet on the \ntable. It was a sickening sight. \n\u201cYes, yes, well done, Slytherin,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cHowever, re-\ncent events must be taken into account.\u201d \nThe room went very still. The Slytherins\u2019 smiles faded a little. \n\u201cAhem,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cI have a few last-minute points to \ndish out. Let me see.

The room \nwent deadly quiet. \u201c. . . for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I \naward Gryffindor House sixty points.\u201d \nThe din was deafening. Those wh o could add up while yelling \nthemselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred \nand seventy-two points \u2014 exactly th e same as Slytherin. They had \ntied for the House Cup \u2014 if only Dumbledore had given Harry just \none more point. \nDumbledore raised his hand. The room gradually fell silent. \n\u201cThere are all kinds of courage, \u201d said Dumbledore, smiling. \u201cIt \ntakes a great deal of bravery to st and up to our enemies, but just as \nmuch to stand up to our friends. I therefore award ten points to \nMr. Neville Longbottom.\u201d \nSomeone standing outside the Great Hall might well have \nthought some sort of explosion ha d taken place, so loud was the \nnoise that erupted from the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up to yell and cheer as Neville, white with shock, \ndisappeared under a pile of people hugging him. He had never won so much as a point for Gryffindor before.

In an instant, the green hangings became \nscarlet and the silver became gold; the huge Slytherin serpent van-ished and a towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was \n \nTHE MAN WITH TWO FACES \n\u0091 307 \u0091 shaking Professor McGo nagall\u2019s hand, with a horrible, forced \nsmile. He caught Harry\u2019s eye and Harry knew at once that Snape\u2019s \nfeelings toward him hadn\u2019t changed one jot. This didn\u2019t worry \nHarry. It seemed as though life wo uld be back to normal next year, \nor as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts. \nIt was the best evening of Harry\u2019 s life, better than winning at \nQuidditch, or Christmas, or knocki ng out mountain trolls . . . he \nwould never, ever forget tonight. \n \nHarry had almost forgotten that the exam results were still to come, but come they did. To their great surprise, both he and Ron \npassed with good marks; Hermione, of course, had the best grades \nof the first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbol-\nogy mark making up for his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped \nthat Goyle, who was almost as stupid as he was mean, might be \nthrown out, but he ha d passed, too. It was a shame, but as Ron \nsaid, you couldn\u2019t have everything in life. \nAnd suddenly, their wardrobes we re empty, their trunks were \npacked, Neville\u2019s toad was found lurk ing in a corner of the toilets; \nnotes were handed out to all st udents, warning them not to use \nmagic over the holidays (\u201cI always hope they\u2019ll forget to give us \nthese,\u201d said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there to take them \ndown to the fleet of boats that sa iled across the lake; they were \nboarding the Hogwarts Express; ta lking and laughing as the coun-\ntryside became greener and tidier; eating Bertie Bott\u2019s Every Flavor \nBeans as they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard \nrobes and putting on jackets and coats; pulling into platform nine \nand three-quarters at King\u2019s Cross station."

Un cle Vernon had even padlocked \nHarry\u2019s owl, Hedwig, in side her cage, to stop her from carrying \nmessages to an yone in the wizarding world. \nHarry looked nothing like the re st of the family. Uncle Vernon \nwas large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt \nPetunia was horse-faced and bony ; Dudley was blond, pink, and \nporky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with bril-\nliant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore \nround glasses, and on his forehe ad was a thin, lightning-shaped \nscar. \nIt was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for \na wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry\u2019s very mysterious \npast, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys\u2019 doorstep \neleven years before. \nAt the age of one year old, Harry had some how survived a curse \nfrom the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose \nname most witches and wizards st ill feared to speak. Harry\u2019s par-\nents had died in Voldemort\u2019s a ttack, but Harry had escaped with \nhis lightning scar, and somehow \u2014 nobody understood why \u2014 \nVoldemort\u2019s powers had been destro yed the instant he had failed to \nkill Harry. \nSo Harry had been brought up by his dead mother\u2019s sister and her \nhusband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never un-\nderstanding why he kept maki ng odd things happen without \nmeaning to, believing the Dursleys\u2019 story that he had got his scar in the car crash that ha d killed his parents. \nAnd then, exactly a year ago, Ho gwarts had written to Harry, \n \nTHE WORST BIRTHDAY \n\u0091 5 \u0091 and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at \nwizard school, where he and his scar were famous . . . but now the \nschool year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the \nsummer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in some-\nthing smelly. \nThe Dursleys hadn\u2019t even rememb ered that today happened to \nbe Harry\u2019s twelfth birthday. Of co urse, his hopes hadn\u2019t been high; \nthey\u2019d never given him a real present, let alon e a cake \u2014 but to ig-\nnore it completely . . . \nAt that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly \nand said, \u201cNow, as we all know, today is a very important day.\u201d \nHarry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. \n\u201cThis could well be the day I ma ke the biggest deal of my ca-\nreer,\u201d said Uncle Vernon. \nHarry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un-\ncle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He\u2019d been talk-\ning of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife \nwere coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge \norder from him (Uncle Vernon \u2019s company made drills). \n\u201cI think we should run through the schedule one more time,\u201d \nsaid Uncle Vernon. \u201cWe should all be in position at eight o\u2019clock. \nPetunia, you will be \u2014 ?\u201d \n\u201cIn the lounge,\u201d said Aunt Petunia promptly, \u201cwaiting to wel-\ncome them graciously to our home.\u201d \n\u201cGood, good.

Dobby \nmight have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but t he wa y thin gs we re go ing, h e\u2019d pro ba bl y starv e to d eath any-way. \nThe cat-flap rattled and Aunt Pe tunia\u2019s hand appeared, pushing \na bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were \naching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was \nstone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the \nroom to Hedwig\u2019s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bot-\ntom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers \nand gave him a look of deep disgust. \n\u201cIt\u2019s no good turning your beak up at it \u2014 that\u2019s all we\u2019ve got,\u201d \nsaid Harry grimly. \nHe put the empty bowl back on th e floor next to the cat-flap and \nlay back down on the bed, some how even hungrier than he had \nbeen before the soup. \nDOBBY\u2019S WARNING \n\u0091 23 \u0091 Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would \nhappen if he didn \u2019t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent \nto see why he hadn \u2019t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go? \nThe room was growing dark. Ex hausted, stomach rumbling, \nmind spinning over the same un answerable questions, Harry fell \ninto an uneasy sleep. \nHe dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading \nunderage wizard attached to his cage. People goggled through \nthe bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He \nsaw Dobby\u2019s face in th e crowd and shouted ou t, asking for help, \nbut Dobby called, \u201cHarry Potter is safe there, sir!\u201d and vanished. \nThen the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the \ncage, laughing at him. \n\u201cStop it,\u201d Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore \nhead. \u201cLeave me alone . . . cut it out . . . I\u2019m trying to sleep. . . .\u201d \nHe opened his eyes. Moonlight wa s shining through the bars on \nthe window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a \nfreckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone. \nRon Weasley was outs ide Harry\u2019s window. \nC H A P T E R T H R E E \n \n\u0091 24 \u0091 THE BURROW \n \n \n \non!\u201d breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it \nup so they could talk thro ugh the bars. \u201cRon, how did \nyou \u2014 What the \u2014 ?\u201d \nHarry\u2019s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was see-\ning hit him. Ron was leaning ou t of the back window of an \nold turquoise car, which was parked in midair. Grinning at Harry \nfrom the front seats were Fred and George, Ron\u2019s elder twin \nbrothers. \n\u201cAll right, Harry?\u201d asked George. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s been going on?\u201d said Ron. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t you been an-\nswering my letters? I\u2019ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you\u2019d got an official warning for us-ing magic in front of Muggles \u2014\u201d \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t me \u2014 and how did he know?\u201d \n\u201cHe works for the Ministry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou know we\u2019re not sup-\nposed to do spells outside school \u2014\u201d R \nTHE BURROW \n\u0091 25 \u0091 \u201cYou should talk,\u201d sa id Harry, staring at the floating car. \n\u201cOh, this doesn\u2019t count,\u201d said Ro n. \u201cWe\u2019re only borrowing this. \nIt\u2019s Dad\u2019s, we didn\u2019t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those \nMuggles you live with \u2014\u201d \n\u201cI told you, I didn\u2019t \u2014 but it\u2019l l take too long to explain now \u2014 \nlook, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked \nme up and won\u2019t let me come back, and obviously I can\u2019t magic \nmyself out, because the Ministry\u2019ll think that\u2019s the second spell I\u2019ve \ndone in three days, so \u2014\u201d \n\u201c S t o p g i b b e r i n g , \u201d s a i d R o n . \u201c W e \u2019 v e c o m e t o t a k e y o u h o m e \nwith us.\u201d \n\u201cBut you can\u2019t magic me out either \u2014\u201d \n\u201cWe don\u2019t need to,\u201d said Ron, jerking his head toward the front \nseat and grinning. \u201cYou forg et who I\u2019ve got with me.\u201d \n\u201cTie that around the bars,\u201d said Fred, throwing the end of a rope \nto Harry. \n\u201cIf the Dursleys wake up, I\u2019m de ad,\u201d said Harry as he tied the \nrope tightly around a bar an d Fred revved up the car. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d said Fred, \u201cand stand back.\u201d \nHarry moved back into the sh adows next to Hedwig, who \nseemed to have realized how impo rtant this was and kept still and \nsilent. The car revved louder an d louder and suddenly, with a \ncrunching noise, the bars were pu lled clean out of the window as \nFred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to \nsee the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron \nhoisted them up into the car. Ha rry listened anxiou sly, but there \nwas no sound from th e Dursleys\u2019 bedroom. \nWhen the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred re-\nversed as close as possible to Harry\u2019s window."

I\u2019ve \nnever seen a de-gnoming \u2014\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s very sweet of you, dear, but it\u2019s dull work,\u201d said Mrs. \nWeasley. \u201cNow, let\u2019s see what Lockhart\u2019s got to say on the \nsubject \u2014\u201d \nAnd she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. \nGeorge groaned. \n\u201cMum, we know how to de-gnome a garden \u2014\u201d"

    "text": "CHAPTER THREE \n\u0091 36 \u0091 Harry looked at the cover of Mr s. Weasley\u2019s book. Written across \nit in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart\u2019s Guide to \nHousehold Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very \ngood-looking wizard with wavy blon d hair and bright blue eyes. As \nalways in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the \nwizard, who Harry supposed was Gild eroy Lockhart, kept winking \ncheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him. \n\u201cOh, he is marvelous,\u201d she said . \u201cHe knows his household pests, \nall right, it\u2019s a wo nderful book. . . .\u201d \n\u201cMum fancies him,\u201d said Fred, in a very audible whisper. \n\u201cDon\u2019t be so ridiculous, Fred,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks \nrather pink. \u201cAll right, if you t hink you know better than Lockhart, \nyou can go and get on with it, an d woe betide you if there\u2019s a sin-\ngle gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.\u201d \nYawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with \nHarry behind them. The garden was la rge, and in Harry\u2019s eyes, ex-\nactly what a garden should be. Th e Dursleys wouldn\u2019t have liked \nit \u2014 there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting \u2014 \nbut there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had \nnever seen spilling from every flow er bed, and a big green pond full \nof frogs. \n\u201cMuggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,\u201d Harry told Ron \nas they crossed the lawn. \n\u201cYeah, I\u2019ve seen those things they think are gnomes,\u201d said Ron, \nbent double with his head in a peony bush, \u201clike fat little Santa \nClauses with fishing rods. . . .\u201d \nThere was a violent scuffling nois e, the peony bush shuddered, \nand Ron straightened up. \u201c This is a gnome,\u201d he said grimly. \n \nTHE BURROW \n\u0091 37 \u0091 \u201cGerroff me! Gerroff me!\u201d squealed the gnome. \nIt was certainly nothing like Sant a Claus. It was small and leath-\nery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. \nRon held it at arm\u2019s length as it kicked out at him with its horny lit-\ntle feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down. \n\u201cThis is what you have to do,\u201d he said. He raised the gnome \nabove his head (\u201cGerroff me!\u201d) and st arted to swing it in great cir-\ncles like a lasso. Seeing the sh ocked look on Harry\u2019s face, Ron \nadded, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt them \u2014 you\u2019ve just got to make them really \ndizzy so they can\u2019t find their way back to the gnomeholes.\u201d \nHe let go of the gnome\u2019s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air \nand landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. \n\u201cPitiful,\u201d said Fred. \u201cI bet I can get mine beyond that stump.\u201d \nHarry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He \ndecided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the \ngnome, sensing weakness, sank it s razor-sharp teeth into Harry\u2019s \nfinger and he had a hard jo b shaking it off \u2014 until \u2014 \n\u201cWow, Harry \u2014 that must\u2019ve been fifty feet. . . .\u201d \nThe air was soon thick with flying gnomes. \n\u201cSee, they\u2019re not too bright,\u201d sa id George, seizing five or six \ngnomes at once. \u201cThe moment th ey know the de-gnoming\u2019s going \non they storm up to have a look. You\u2019d think they\u2019d have learned by \nnow just to stay put.\u201d \nSoon, the crowd of gnomes in th e field started walking away in \na straggling line, their li ttle shoulders hunched. \n\u201cThey\u2019ll be back,\u201d said Ron as they watched the gnomes disap-\npear into the hedge on the other side of the field. \u201cThey love it \nhere. . . . Dad\u2019s too soft with them ; he thinks they\u2019re funny. . . .\u201d"

He was wearing long \ngreen robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. \n\u201cWhat a night,\u201d he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all \nsat down around him. \u201cNine raids. Nine!

Of course, it\u2019s very hard to convict anyone because no \nMuggle would admit their key keeps shrinking \u2014 they\u2019ll insist \nthey just keep losing it.

There\u2019s a loophole in the law, \nyou\u2019ll find. . . .

Harry \njust caught sight of a pair of br ight brown eyes staring at him be-\nfore it closed with a snap. \n\u201cGinny,\u201d said Ron. \u201cYou don\u2019t know how weird it is for her to be \nthis shy. She never sh uts up normally \u2014\u201d \nThey climbed two more flights until they reached a door with \npeeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying ronald\u2019s room . \nHarry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, \nand blinked. It was like walking in to a furnace: Nearly everything \nin Ron\u2019s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bed-\nspread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of th e shabby wallpape r with posters \nof the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. \n\u201cYour Quidditch team?\u201d said Harry. \u201cThe Chudley Cannons,\u201d said Ron, pointing at the orange bed-\nspread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C\u2019s and a \nspeeding cannonball. \u201cN inth in the league.\u201d \nRon\u2019s school spellbooks were stacke d untidily in a corner, next to \na pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin \nMiggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron\u2019s magic wand was lying on top of a fish \ntank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, \nScabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. \nHarry stepped over a pack of Se lf-Shuffling playing cards on the \nfloor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he \ncould see a gang of gnomes sneaki ng one by one ba ck through the \nWeasleys\u2019 hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watch-\ning him almost nervously, as th ough waiting for his opinion. \n \nTHE BURROW \n\u0091 41 \u0091 \u201cIt\u2019s a bit small,\u201d said Ron quickl y. \u201cNot like that room you had \nwith the Muggles. And I\u2019m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; \nhe\u2019s always banging on the pipes and groaning. . . .\u201d \nBut Harry, grinning widely, said, \u201cT his is the best house I\u2019ve ever \nbeen in.\u201d \nRon\u2019s ears went pink. \nC H A P T E R F O U R \n \n\u0091 42 \u0091 AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS \n \n \nife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet \nDrive. The Dursleys liked ev erything neat and ordered; the \nWeasleys\u2019 house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got \na shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen man-\ntelpiece and it shouted, \u201c Tuck your shirt in, scruffy !\u201d The ghoul in \nthe attic howled and dropped pipe s whenever he felt things were \ngetting too quiet, and small expl osions from Fred and George\u2019s \nbedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found \nmost unusual about life at Ron\u2019s, however, wasn\u2019t the talking mir-ror or the clanking gh oul: It was the fact that everybody there \nseemed to like him. \nMrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force \nhim to eat fourth helpings at ev ery meal. Mr. Weas ley liked Harry \nto sit next to him at the dinner ta ble so that he could bombard him \nwith questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how \nthings like plugs and th e postal service worked. L \nAT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS \n\u0091 43 \u0091 \u201cFascinating !\u201d he would say as Harry talked him through using a \ntelephone. \u201c Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found \nof getting along without magic.\u201d \nHarry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week \nafter he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to \nbreakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting \nat the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny acciden-\ntally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry \nentered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and \nemerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he \nhadn\u2019t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. \nWeasley offered him. \n\u201cLetters from school,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron \nidentical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. \n\u201cDumbledore already knows you\u2019 re here, Harry \u2014 doesn\u2019t miss a \ntrick, that man. You two\u2019ve got th em, too,\u201d he added, as Fred and \nGeorge ambled in, sti ll in their pajamas. \nFor a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. \nHarry\u2019s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from \nKing\u2019s Cross station on September fi rst. There was also a list of the \nnew books he\u2019d need for the coming year. \nsecond-year students will require: \nThe Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 \nby Miranda Goshawk \nBreak with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart \nGadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart \nHolidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart"

Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Mal-\nfoy stepped into the shop. \nThe man who followed could only be Draco\u2019s father. He had the \nsame pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy \ncrossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a \nbell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, \u201cTouch nothing, Draco.\u201d \nMalfoy, who had reached for the gl ass eye, said, \u201cI thought you \nwere going to buy me a present.\u201d \n\u201cI said I would buy you a racing broom,\u201d said his father, drum-\nming his fingers on the counter. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of that if I\u2019m not on the House team?\u201d said \nMalfoy, looking sulky and bad- tempered. \u201cHarry Potter got a \nNimbus Two Thousand last year.

How may I be of assistance? I must show you, \njust in today, and very reasonably priced \u2014\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,\u201d said Mr. Mal-\nfoy. \n\u201cSelling?\u201d The smile faded slig htly from Mr. Borgin\u2019s face. \n\u201cYou have heard, of course, th at the Ministry is conducting \nmore raids,\u201d said Mr. Malfoy, taki ng a roll of parchment from his \ninside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. \u201cI have a \nfew \u2014 ah \u2014 items at home that might embarrass me, if the Min-\nistry were to call. . . .\u201d \nMr. Borgin fixed a pair of pinc e-nez to his nose and looked \ndown the list. \n\u201cThe Ministry wouldn\u2019t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?\u201d \nMr. Malfoy\u2019s lip curled. \n\u201cI have not been visited yet. Th e name Malfoy still commands a \ncertain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. \nThere are rumors about a new Mu ggle Protection Act \u2014 no doubt \nthat flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind \nit \u2014\u201d \nHarry felt a hot surge of anger. \n\u201c\u2014 and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it ap-\npear \u2014\u201d \n\u201cI understand, sir, of course,\u201d sa id Mr. Borgin. \u201cLet me see . . .\u201d \n\u201cCan I have that?\u201d interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered \nhand on its cushion."

The one he\u2019d just left, \nBorgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty \nwindow display of shrunken head s and, two doors down, a large \ncage was alive with gigantic black spiders.

The perfect moment for me to \nmake a little announcement I\u2019ve been sitting on for some time! \n\u201cWhen young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts to-\nday, he only wanted to buy my autobiography \u2014 which I shall \nbe happy to present him now, free of charge \u2014\u201d The crowd \napplauded again. \u201cHe had no idea, \u201d Lockhart continued, giving \nHarry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, \n\u201cthat he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, \nMagical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real \nmagical me. Yes, ladies and gentle men, I have great pleasure and \npride in announcing that this Sept ember, I will be taking up the \npost of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!\u201d \nThe crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being \n \nAT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS \n\u0091 61 \u0091 presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering \nslightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the \nlimelight to the edge of the room , where Ginny was standing next \nto her new cauldron. \n\u201cYou have these,\u201d Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into \nthe cauldron. \u201cI\u2019ll buy my own \u2014\u201d \n\u201cBet you loved that, didn\u2019t you, Potter?\u201d said a voice Harry had \nno trouble recognizing.

It was the \nfirst time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Mal-foy. \n\u201cPotter, you\u2019ve got yourself a girlfriend !\u201d drawled Malfoy. Ginny \nwent scarlet as Ron and Hermio ne fought their way over, both \nclutching stacks of Lockhart\u2019s books. \n\u201cOh, it\u2019s you,\u201d said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were some-\nthing unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. \u201cBet you\u2019re surprised to see \nHarry here, eh?\u201d \n\u201cNot as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,\u201d retorted \nMalfoy. \u201cI suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay \nfor all those.\u201d \nRon went as red as Ginny. He dr opped his books into the caul-\ndron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione \ngrabbed the back of his jacket. \n\u201cRon!\u201d said Mr. Weasley, struggl ing over with Fred and George. \n\u201cWhat are you doing?

At that very \nmoment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a \n \nTHE WHOMPING WILLOW \n\u0091 75 \u0091 charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an \nequally heavy blow hit the roof. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s happen \u2014 ?\u201d \nRon gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked \naround just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into \nit. The tree they had hit was atta cking them. Its trunk was bent al-\nmost double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of \nthe car it could reach. \n\u201cAaargh!\u201d said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent \ninto his door; the windshield wa s now trembling under a hail of \nblows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering \nram was pounding furiously on th e roof, which seemed to be cav-\ning \u2014 \n\u201cRun for it!\u201d Ron shouted, throwi ng his full weight against his \ndoor, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry\u2019s \nlap by a vicious uppercut from another branch. \n\u201cWe\u2019re done for!\u201d he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly \nthe floor of the car was vibratin g \u2014 the engine had restarted. \n\u201cReverse !\u201d Harry yelled, and the car shot backwa rd; the tree was \nstill trying to hit them ; they could hear its roots creaking as it al-\nmost ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sp ed out of reach. \n\u201cThat,\u201d panted Ron, \u201cwas close. Well done, car \u2014\u201d \nThe car, however, had reached th e end of its tether. With two \nsharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip side-\nways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. \nLoud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from \nthe trunk; Hedwig\u2019s cage flew through the air and burst open; she \nrose out of it with an angry screec h and sped off toward the castle"

Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, \nthe car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear li ghts blazing angrily. \n\u201cCome back!\u201d Ron yelled after it , brandishing his broken wand. \n\u201cDad\u2019ll kill me!\u201d \nBut the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its \nexhaust. \n\u201cCan you believe our luck?\u201d said Ron miserably, bending down \nto pick up Scabbers. \u201cOf all the trees we could\u2019ve hit, we had to get \none that hits back.\u201d \nHe glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still \nflailing its branch es threateningly. \n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Harry wearily, \u201cwe\u2019d better get up to the \nschool. . . .\u201d \nIt wasn\u2019t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured.

Ginny \nTHE WHOMPING WILLOW \n\u0091 77 \u0091 was among them, easily visible be cause of her vivid Weasley hair. \nMeanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her \nhair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat \non a stool before the newcomers. \nEvery year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted \nnew students into the four Ho gwarts houses (Gryffindor, Huf-\nflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytheri n). Harry well remembered putting \nit on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as \nit muttered aloud in his ear. Fo r a few horrible seconds he had \nfeared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House \nthat had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any \nother \u2014 but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, \nHermione, and the rest of the We asleys. Last term, Harry and Ron \nhad helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating \nSlytherin for the first time in seven years. \nA very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place \nthe hat on his head. Harry\u2019s eyes wandered past him to where Pro-\nfessor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from \nthe staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining \nbrightly in the candlelight. Severa l seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy \nLockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was \nHagrid, huge and hair y, drinking deeply from his goblet. \n\u201cHang on . . .\u201d Harry muttered to Ron. \u201cThere\u2019s an empty chair \nat the staff table. . . . Where\u2019s Snape?\u201d \nProfessor Severus Snape was Harry\u2019s least favorite teacher. Harry \nalso happened to be Snape\u2019s least fa vorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, \nand disliked by everybody except the students from his own House \n(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. \n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s ill!\u201d said Ron hopefully."

He told \nDumbledore everything except th at Mr. Weasley owned the be-\nwitched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened \nto find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumble-\ndore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no \nquestions about the car.

The red envelope , which had dropped \nfrom Ron\u2019s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry \nand Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over \nthem. A few people laug hed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke \nout again. \nHermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the \ntop of Ron\u2019s head. \nGILDEROY LOCKHART \n\u0091 89 \u0091 \u201cWell, I don\u2019t know what you expected, Ron, but you \u2014\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t tell me I deserved it,\u201d snapped Ron. \nHarry pushed his porridge away. Hi s insides were burning with \nguilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and \nMrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer . . . \nBut he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was \nmoving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. \nHarry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the \nHufflepuffs first. \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the \nvegetable patch, and made for th e greenhouses, where the magical \nplants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: \nHermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough \nand was being perfectly friendly again. \nAs they neared the greenhouses th ey saw the rest of the class \nstanding outside, waiting for Pr ofessor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and \nHermione had only just joined th em when she came striding into \nview across the lawn, accompanie d by Gilderoy Lockhart. Profes-\nsor Sprout\u2019s arms were full of band ages, and with another twinge of \nguilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several \nof its branches now in slings. \nProfessor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat \nover her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on \nher clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia \nfaint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping \nrobes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly posi-\ntioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. \n\u201cOh, hello there!\u201d he called, beaming around at the assembled"

They had only ever worked in \ngreenhouse one before \u2014 greenhouse three housed far more in-teresting and dangerous plants. Pr ofessor Sprout took a large key \nfrom her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, \numbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to \nfollow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart\u2019s hand shot out. \n\u201cHarry! I\u2019ve been wanting a word \u2014 you don\u2019t mind if he\u2019s a \ncouple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?\u201d \nJudging by Professor Sprout\u2019s sc owl, she did mind, but Lockhart \nsaid, \u201cThat\u2019s the ticket ,\u201d and closed the gree nhouse door in her \nface. \n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Lockhart, his larg e white teeth gleaming in the \nsunlight as he shook his he ad. \u201cHarry, Harry, Harry.\u201d \nCompletely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. \n\u201cWhen I heard \u2014 well, of course , i t w a s a l l m y f a u l t .

Natural to want a bit more once you\u2019ve \nhad that first taste \u2014 and I blame myself for giving you that, be-\ncause it was bound to go to your head \u2014 but see here, young man, \nyou can\u2019t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm \ndown, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you\u2019re older.

In fact, I\u2019 d say I was even \nmore of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven\u2019t \nthey? All that business with He -Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!\u201d He \nglanced at the lightning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead. \u201cI know, I \nknow \u2014 it\u2019s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly\u2019s Most-\nCharming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have \u2014 but it\u2019s a \nstart, Harry, it\u2019s a start. \u201d \nHe gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood \nstunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to \nbe in the greenhouse, he open ed the door and slid inside. \nProfessor Sprout was standing be hind a trestle bench in the cen-\nter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear-muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place \nbetween Ron and Hermione, she sa id, \u201cWe\u2019ll be repotting Man-\ndrakes today.

A hundred or so tufty little \nplants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Har ry, who didn\u2019t ha ve the slightest \nidea what Hermione meant by the \u201ccry\u201d of the Mandrake. \n\u201cEveryone take a pair of earm uffs,\u201d said Professor Sprout. \nThere was a scramble as everyone tr ied to seize a pair that wasn\u2019t \npink and fluffy. \n\u201cWhen I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are com-\npletely covered,\u201d said Professor Sprout. \u201cWhen it is safe to remove \nthem, I will give you the th umbs-up.

Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. \n \nGILDEROY LOCKHART \n\u0091 93 \u0091 Harry let out a gasp of surpri se that no one could hear. \nInstead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby \npopped out of the earth. The leav es were growing right out of his \nhead. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at \nthe top of his lungs. \nProfessor Sprout took a large pl ant pot from under the table and \nplunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp com-\npost until only the tu fted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout \ndusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed \nher own earmuffs. \n\u201cAs our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won\u2019t kill yet,\u201d \nshe said calmly as though she\u2019d just done nothing more exciting \nthan water a begoni a. \u201cHowever, they will knock you out for sev-\neral hours, and as I\u2019m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you \nwork.

The \nMandrakes didn\u2019t like coming out of the earth, but didn\u2019t seem to \nwant to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their \nsharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole \nminutes trying to squash a part icularly fat one into a pot. \nBy the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, \naching, and covered in earth. Everyo ne traipsed back to the castle \nfor a quick wash and then the Gry ffindors hurried off to Transfig-\nuration. \nProfessor McGonagall\u2019s classes we re always hard work, but today \nwas especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was \nsupposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed \n \nGILDEROY LOCKHART \n\u0091 95 \u0091 to do was give his beetle a lot of exer cise as it scuttled over the desk-\ntop avoiding his wand. \nRon was having far worse prob lems. He had pa tched up his \nwand with some borrowed Spellotape , but it seemed to be damaged \nbeyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and \nevery time Ron tried to transfigur e his beetle it engulfed him in \nthick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what \nhe was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his el-\nbow and had to ask for a new on e. Professor McGonagall wasn\u2019t \npleased. \nHarry was relieved to hear the lu nch bell. His brain felt like a \nwrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and \nRon, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk. \n\u201cStupid \u2014 useless \u2014 thing \u2014\u201d \u201cWrite home for another one,\u201d Harry suggested as the wand let \noff a volley of bangs like a firecracker. \n\u201cOh, yeah, and get another Howler back,\u201d said Ron, stuffing the \nnow hissing wand into his bag. \u201c \u2018 It\u2019s your own fault your wand got \nsnapped \u2014\u2019 \u201d \nThey went down to lunch, wher e Ron\u2019s mood was not improved \nby Hermione\u2019s showing them the ha ndful of perfec t coat buttons \nshe had produced in Transfiguration. \n\u201cWhat\u2019ve we got this afternoon?\u201d said Harry, hastily changing \nthe subject. \n\u201cDefense Against the Dark Arts ,\u201d said Hermione at once. \n\u201cWhy, \u201d demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, \u201chave you outlined \nall Lockhart\u2019s lessons in little hearts?\u201d \nHermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously."

It is my jo b to arm you against the foulest \ncreatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing \nyour worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall \nyou whilst I am here.

The pixies shot in every direction like \nrockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into \nthe air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the \nback row with broken glass. The re st proceeded to wreck the class-\nroom more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class wi th them, shredded books and pa-\npers, tore pictures from the wa lls, up-ended the waste basket, \ngrabbed bags and books and thre w them out of the smashed win-\ndow; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and \nNeville was swinging from the ir on chandelier in the ceiling. \n\u201cCome on now \u2014 round them up, round them up, they\u2019re only \npixies,\u201d Lockhart shouted. \nHe rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, \n\u201cPeskipiksi Pesternomi !\u201d \nIt had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and \nthrew it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under \nhis own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as th e chandelier gave way. \nThe bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the \nrelative calm that followed, Lock hart straightened up, caught sight \nof Harry, Ron, and Hermione, wh o were almost at the door, and \nsaid, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into \ntheir cage.\u201d He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind \nhim. \n \nGILDEROY LOCKHART \n\u0091 103 \u0091 \u201cCan you believe him?\u201d roared Ron as on e of the remaining pix-\nies bit him painfully on the ear. \n\u201cHe just wants to give us so me hands-on experience,\u201d said \nHermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing \nCharm and stuffing them back into their cage. \n\u201cHands on ?\u201d said Harry, who was tryi ng to grab a pixie dancing \nout of reach with its tongue out. \u201cHermione, he didn\u2019t have a clue \nwhat he was doing \u2014\u201d \n\u201cRubbish,\u201d said Hermione. \u201cYou\u2019v e read his books \u2014 look at all \nthose amazing thin gs he\u2019s done \u2014\u201d \n\u201cHe says he\u2019s done,\u201d Ron muttered. \nC H A P T E R S E V E N \n \n\u0091 104 \u0091 MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS \n \n \narry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging \nout of sight whenever he sa w Gilderoy Lockhart coming \ndown a corridor.

Nothing seemed to give \nColin a bigger thrill than to say, \u201cAll right, Harry?\u201d six or seven \ntimes a day and hear, \u201cHello, Co lin,\u201d back, however exasperated \nHarry sounded when he said it. \nHedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car \njourney and Ron\u2019s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself \non Friday morning by shooting ou t of Ron\u2019s hand in Charms and \nhitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creat-\ning a large, throbbing green boil wh ere it had struck. So with one \nthing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, \nRon, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday \nmorning. Harry, however, was shak en awake several hours earlier \n H \nMUDBLOODS AND MURMURS \n\u0091 105 \u0091 than he would have liked by Ol iver Wood, Captain of the Gryf-\nfindor Quidditch team. \n\u201cWhassamatter?\u201d said Harry groggily. \n\u201cQuidditch practice!\u201d said Wood. \u201cCome on!\u201d \nHarry squinted at the window.

He was a ta ll and burly sixth year and, at \nthe moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. \u201cIt\u2019s \npart of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and \nlet\u2019s go,\u201d said Wood heartily. \u201cNone of the other teams have started \ntraining yet; we\u2019re going to be first off the mark this year \u2014\u201d \nYawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and \ntried to find his Quidditch robes. \n\u201cGood man,\u201d said Wood. \u201cMeet you on the field in fifteen min-\nutes.\u201d \nWhen he\u2019d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak \nfor warmth, Harry scribbled a no te to Ron explaining where \nhe\u2019d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common \nroom, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just \nreached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down th e spiral staircase, his camera \nswinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his \nhand. \n\u201cI heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry!

There are two Beaters \n \nMUDBLOODS AND MURMURS \n\u0091 107 \u0091 on each team who carry clubs to be at the Bludgers away from their \nside.

He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the \narrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood \nlaunched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley\u2019s head \ndrooped right onto Al icia Spinnet\u2019s shoulder and he began to \nsnore. \nThe first board took nearly twent y minutes to explain, but there \nwas another board under that, an d a third under that one. Harry \nsank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. \n\u201cSo,\u201d said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fan-\ntasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very mo-\nment up at the castle. \u201cIs that clear?

Okay, let\u2019s go \nand put our new theories into prac tice!\u201d Wood shouted, seizing his \nbroomstick and leading the way ou t of the locker rooms. Stiff-\nlegged and still yawning, his team followed. \nThey had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up \ncompletely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in \nthe stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Her-\nmione sitting in the stands. \n\u201cAren\u2019t you finished yet?\u201d called Ron incredulously. \n\u201cHaven\u2019t even started,\u201d said Harry , looking jealously at the toast \nand marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. \u201cWood\u2019s been te aching us new moves.\u201d \nHe mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring \nup into the air. The cool mornin g air whipped his face, waking him \nfar more effectively than Wood\u2019s lo ng talk. It felt wonderful to be \nback on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, raci ng Fred and George. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that funny clicking noise? \u201d called Fred as they hurtled \naround the corner. \nHarry looked into the stands.

Hagrid didn\u2019t seem perturbed by \nRon\u2019s slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered \nRon into a chair. \n\u201cBetter out than in,\u201d he said ch eerfully, plunking a large copper \nbasin in front of him. \u201cGet \u2019em all up, Ron.\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to do except wait for it to stop,\u201d \nsaid Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. \n\u201cThat\u2019s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a bro-\nken wand \u2014\u201d \nHagrid was bustling around maki ng them tea. His boarhound, \nFang, was slobbering over Harry. \n\u201cWhat did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?\u201d Harry asked, \nscratching Fa ng\u2019s ears. \n\u201cGivin\u2019 me advice on gettin\u2019 kelpies out of a well,\u201d growled \n \nMUDBLOODS AND MURMURS \n\u0091 115 \u0091 Hagrid, moving a half-plucked ro oster off his scrubbed table and \nsetting down the teapot. \u201cLike I don\u2019 know. An\u2019 bangin\u2019 on about \nsome banshee he banished. If one wo rd of it was true, I\u2019ll eat my \nkettle.\u201d \nIt was most unlike Hagrid to cr iticize a Hogwarts teacher, and \nHarry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a \nvoice somewhat higher than usual, \u201cI think you\u2019re being a bit un-\nfair. Professor Dumbledore obviousl y thought he was the best man \nfor the job \u2014\u201d \n\u201cHe was the on\u2019y man for the job,\u201d said Hagrid, offering them a \nplate of treacle toffee, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. \n\u201cAn\u2019 I mean the on\u2019y one. Gettin\u2019 very difficult ter find anyone fer \nthe Dark Arts job. People aren\u2019t to o keen ter take it on, see. They\u2019re \nstartin\u2019 ter think it\u2019s jinxed.

Feel-\ning dazed, Harry left. \nIt was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost \nempty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn\u2019t back \nyet.

Half an \nhour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong \nsmell of polish into the darkened room. \n\u201cMy muscles have all seized up,\u201d he groaned, sinking on his bed. \n\u201cFourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before he \nwas satisfied.

Madam Po mfrey, the nurs e, was kept \nbusy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her \nPepperup Potion worked instantly, th ough it left the drinker smok-\ning at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had \nbeen looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The \nsteam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that \nher whole head was on fire. \nRaindrops the size of bullets th undered on the castle windows \nfor days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy \nstreams, and Hagrid\u2019s pumpkins swe lled to the size of garden sheds. \nOliver Wood\u2019s enthusiasm for regula r training sessions, however, \nwas not dampened, which was why Harr y was to be found, late one \nstormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning \nto Gryffindor Tower, drenched to th e skin and splattered with mud. \n O \nTHE DEATHDAY PARTY \n\u0091 123 \u0091 Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn\u2019t been a happy prac-\ntice session. Fred and George, wh o had been spying on the Slyth-\nerin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus \nTwo Thousand and Ones. They repo rted that the Slytherin team \nwas no more than seve n greenish blurs, shooting through the air \nlike missiles. \nAs Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across \nsomebody who looked ju st as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Head-\nless Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out \nof a window, muttering under his breath, \u201c. . . don\u2019t fulfill their re-quirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .\u201d \n\u201cHello, Nick,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cHello, hello,\u201d said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking \nround. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was al-\nmost completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. \n\u201cYou look troubled, young Potte r,\u201d said Nick, folding a trans-\nparent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet. \n\u201cSo do you,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cAh,\u201d Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, \u201ca matter of \nno importance. . . . It\u2019s not as though I really wanted to join. . . . \nThought I\u2019d apply, but apparently I \u2018don\u2019t fulfill requirements\u2019 \u2014\u201d \nIn spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on \nhis face. \n\u201cBut you would think, wouldn\u2019t you,\u201d he erupted suddenly, \npulling the letter back out of his pocket, \u201cthat getting hit forty-five \ntimes in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?\u201d"

However \u2014\u201d \nNearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously: \n \n\u201c\u2018We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have \nparted company with their bodies. You will appreciate \nthat it would be impossible otherwise for members to \nparticipate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-\nJuggling and Head Polo.

He looked down and \nfound himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was \nMrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Ar-\ngus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students. \n\u201cYou\u2019d better get out of here, Ha rry,\u201d said Nick quickly. \u201cFilch \nTHE DEATHDAY PARTY \n\u0091 125 \u0091 isn\u2019t in a good mood \u2014 he\u2019s got th e flu and some third years acci-\ndentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. \nHe\u2019s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all \nover the place \u2014\u201d \n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. \nNorris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysteri-\nous power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch \nburst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry\u2019s righ t, wheezing and \nlooking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple. \n\u201cFilth!\u201d he shouted, his jowls aquiver, hi s eyes popping alarm-\ningly as he pointed at the mudd y puddle that ha d dripped from \nHarry\u2019s Quidditch robe s. \u201cMess and muck ev erywhere! I\u2019ve had \nenough of it, I tell yo u! Follow me, Potter!\u201d \nSo Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and \nfollowed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy \nfootprints on the floor. \nHarry had never been inside Filch\u2019s office before; it was a place \nmost students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by \na single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried \nfish lingered about th e place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around \nthe walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained de-\ntails of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George \nWeasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished col-\nlection of chains and manacles hu ng on the wall behind Filch\u2019s desk. \nIt was common knowle dge that he was always begging Dumbledore \nto let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. \nFilch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling \naround looking for parchment."

Hope-fully, whatever Peeves had done (a nd it sounded as though he\u2019d \nwrecked something very big this ti me) would distract Filch from \nHarry. \nT h i n k i n g t h a t h e s h o u l d p r o b a b l y w a i t f o r F i l c h t o c o m e b a c k , \nHarry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only \none thing on it apart from his half -completed form: a large, glossy, \nTHE DEATHDAY PARTY \n\u0091 127 \u0091 purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick \nglance at the door to check that Filch wasn\u2019t on his way back, Harry \npicked up the envelope and read: \n \nKWIKSPELL \nA Correspondence Course in Beginners\u2019 Magic \n Intrigued, Harry flicked the env elope open and pulled out the \nsheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front \npage said: \n \nFeel out of step in the world of mo dern magic? Find yourself making \nexcuses not to perform simple spells?

Did \nthis mean he wasn \u2019t a proper wi zard? Harry was just reading \u201cLes-\nson One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)\u201d when shuffling \nfootsteps outside told him Filch was coming back.

Harry braced himself for a tidal \nwave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the en-\nvelope, and threw it into a drawer. \n\u201cHave you \u2014 did you read \u2014 ?\u201d he sputtered. \n\u201cNo,\u201d Harry lied quickly. \nFilch\u2019s knobbly hands were twisting together. \n\u201cIf I thought you\u2019d read my private \u2014 not that it\u2019s mine \u2014 for a \nfriend \u2014 be that as it may \u2014 however \u2014\u201d \nHarry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked mad-\nder.

To escape from Filch\u2019s office without punish-\nment was probably some kind of school record. \n\u201cHarry! Harry! Di d it work?\u201d \nNearly Headless Nick came glid ing out of a classroom. Behind \nhim, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabi-\nnet that appeared to have been dropped from a great height. \n\u201cI persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch\u2019s office,\u201d said \nNick eagerly. \u201cThought it might distract him \u2014\u201d \n\u201cWas that you?\u201d said Harry gratefully. \u201cYeah, it worked, I didn\u2019t \neven get detention.

Nearly Headless Nick, \nHarry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick\u2019s re jection letter. \n\u201cI wish there was something I could do for you about the Head-\nless Hunt,\u201d Harry said. \nNearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked \nright through him. He wished he hadn\u2019t; it was like stepping through \nan icy shower. \n\u201cBut there is something you could do for me,\u201d said Nick ex-\ncitedly. \u201cHarry \u2014 would I be asking too much \u2014 but no, you \nwouldn\u2019t want \u2014\u201d \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cWell, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,\u201d said \nNearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified. \n\u201cOh,\u201d said Harry, not sure whet her he should look sorry or \nhappy about this. \u201cRight.\u201d \n\u201cI\u2019m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. \nFriends will be coming from all over the country.

The rest of the school was \nhappily anticipating their Hallowee n feast; the Great Hall had been \ndecorated with the usua l live bats, Hagrid\u2019s vast pumpkins had \nbeen carved into lanterns large en ough for three men to sit in, and \nthere were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of danc-ing skeletons for the entertainment. \n\u201cA promise is a promise,\u201d He rmione reminded Harry bossily. \n\u201cYou said you\u2019d go to the deathday party.\u201d \nSo at seven o\u2019clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight \npast the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering \ninvitingly with gold plates and ca ndles, and directed their steps in-\nstead toward the dungeons. \nThe passageway leading to Near ly Headless Nick\u2019s party had \nbeen lined with candles, too, though the effe ct was far from cheer-\nful: These were long, thin, jet-blac k tapers, all burning bright blue, \ncasting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered \nand drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like \na thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard."

They passed a group \nof gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, \na cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an \narrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn\u2019t surprised to see \nthat the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered \nin silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other \nghosts. \n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Hermione, stoppi ng abruptly. \u201cTurn back, turn \nback, I don\u2019t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle \u2014\u201d \n\u201cWho?\u201d said Harry as th ey backtracked quickly. \n\u201cShe haunts one of the toilets in the girls\u2019 bathroom on the first \nfloor,\u201d said Hermione. \n\u201cShe haunts a toilet ?\u201d \nTHE DEATHDAY PARTY \n\u0091 133 \u0091 \u201cYes.

They approached it eagerly but next moment had \nstopped in their tracks, horrified . The smell was quite disgusting. \nLarge, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, \nburned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great \nmaggoty haggis, a slab of cheese co vered in furry green mold and, \nin pride of place, an enormous gr ay cake in the shape of a tomb-\nstone, with tar-like ic ing forming the words, \n \nSir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington \ndied 31st October, 1492 \n \nHarry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, \ncrouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that \nit passed through one of the stinking salmon. \n\u201cCan you taste it if you walk through it?\u201d Harry asked him. \n\u201cAlmost,\u201d said the ghost sa dly, and he drifted away. \n\u201cI expect they\u2019ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,\u201d said Her-\nmione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look \nat the putrid haggis. \n\u201cCan we move?

Then he saw Mrs. \nNorris and fell back, clut ching his face in horror. \n\u201cMy cat! My cat!

Dumbledore \nlaid Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione exchange d tense looks an d sank into \nchairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching. \nThe tip of Dumbledore\u2019s long, crook ed nose was barely an inch \nfrom Mrs. Norris\u2019s fur.

But then disagreements sprang \nup between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the \nothers. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students ad-\nmitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be \nkept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Mug-\ngle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy.

The story go es that Slytherin had built a \n \nTHE WRITING ON THE WALL \n\u0091 151 \u0091 hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew \nnothing. \n\u201cSlytherin, according to the lege nd, sealed the Chamber of Se-\ncrets so that none would be able to open it until hi s own true heir \narrived at the school. The heir al one would be able to unseal the \nChamber of Secrets, un leash the horror within, and use it to purge \nthe school of all who were unworthy to study magic.\u201d \nThere was silence as he finished te lling the story, but it wasn\u2019t the \nusual, sleepy silence that filled Pr ofessor Binns\u2019s classes. There was \nunease in the air as everyone cont inued to watch him, hoping for \nmore. Professor Binns l ooked faintly annoyed. \n\u201cThe whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cNatu-\nrally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, \nmany times, by the most learned witches and wizards.

I\u2019m drinking nothing with Crabbe\u2019s \ntoenails in it \u2014\u201d \nHermione continued as thou gh she hadn\u2019t heard him. \n\u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about th at yet, though, because we add \nthose bits last. . . .\u201d \nRon turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry. \n\u201cD\u2019you realize how mu ch we\u2019re going to have to steal, Her-\nmione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that\u2019s definitely not in the \nstudents\u2019 cupboard. What\u2019re we goin g to do, break into Snape\u2019s pri-\nvate stores? I don\u2019t know if this is a good idea. . . .\u201d \nHermione shut the book with a snap. \n\u201cWell, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,\u201d she said. There \nwere bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter \nthan usual. \u201c I don \u2019t want to break rules, you know. I think threat-\nening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult po-\ntion. But if you don\u2019t want to find ou t if it\u2019s Malfoy, I\u2019ll go straight \nto Madam Pince now and hand the book back in \u2014\u201d"

But not toenails, \nokay?\u201d \n\u201cHow long will it take to make, anyway?\u201d said Harry as Her-\nmione, looking happier, opened the book again. \n\u201cWell, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon \nand the lacewings have got to be st ewed for twenty-one days . . . I\u2019d \nsay it\u2019d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.\u201d \n\u201cA month?\u201d said Ron. \u201cMalfoy could have attacked half the \nMuggle-borns in the school by then!\u201d But Hermione\u2019s eyes nar-\nrowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, \u201cBut it\u2019s the best plan we\u2019ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.\u201d \nHowever, while Hermione was chec king that the coast was clear \nfor them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, \u201cIt\u2019ll be a \nlot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomor-\nrow.\u201d \n \nHarry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while think-\ning about the coming Quidditch ma tch. He was nervous, mainly at \nthe thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at \nthe idea of facing a team mounted on the fa stest racing brooms \ngold could buy. He had never want ed to beat Slytherin so badly. \nAfter half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got \nup, dressed, and went down to brea kfast early, where he found the \nrest of the Gryffindor team huddl ed at the long, empty table, all \nlooking uptight and not speaking much. \nAs eleven o\u2019clock approached, the whole school st arted to make \nits way down to the Quidditch stadiu m. It was a muggy sort of day \n \nTHE ROGUE BLUDGER \n\u0091 167 \u0091 with a hint of thunder in the ai r. Ron and Hermione came hurry-\ning over to wish Harry good luck as he entered th e locker rooms. \nThe team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down \nto listen to Wood\u2019s us ual pre-match pep talk. \n\u201cSlytherin has better brooms than us,\u201d he began. \u201cNo point de-\nnying it. But we\u2019ve got better people on our brooms. We\u2019ve trained \nharder than they have, we\u2019ve been flying in all weathers \u2014\u201d (\u201cToo \ntrue,\u201d muttered George Weasley. \u201cI haven\u2019t been properly dry since \nAugust\u201d) \u201c\u2014 and we\u2019re going to make them rue the day they let \nthat little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.\u201d \nChest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. \u201cIt\u2019ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to \nhave something more than a rich fa ther. Get to that Snitch before \nMalfoy or die trying, Harry, becaus e we\u2019ve got to win today, we\u2019ve \ngot to.\u201d \n\u201cSo no pressure, Harry,\u201d sa id Fred, winking at him. \nAs they walked out onto the field, a roar of noise greeted them; \nmainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to \nsee Slytherin beaten, but the Slyt herins in the crowd made their \nboos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, \nasked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each \nother threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was neces-\nsary. \n\u201cOn my whistle,\u201d said Madam Hooch. \u201cThree . . . two . . . \none . . .\u201d \nWith a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen \nplayers rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting arou nd for the Snitch."

At that very moment, a heavy black \nBludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that \nhe felt it ruffle hi s hair as it passed. \n\u201cClose one, Harry!\u201d said George, streaking past him with his \nclub in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slyth-\nerin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the \ndirection of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in \nmidair and shot straig ht for Harry again. \nHarry dropped quickly to avoid it , and George managed to hit \nit hard toward Malfoy.

Madam Hooch\u2019s whistle \nrang out and Harry, Fred, and Geor ge dived for the ground, still \ntrying to avoid the mad Bludger. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled \ntogether, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. \u201cWe\u2019re being flat-\ntened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped \nAngelina scoring?\u201d \n\u201cWe were twenty feet above he r, stopping the other Bludger \nfrom murdering Harry, Oliver,\u201d said George angrily. \u201cSomeone\u2019s \nfixed it \u2014 it won\u2019t leave Harry alone. It hasn\u2019t gone for anyone else \nall game.

Shivering, Harry \nwalked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching \nsnatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was \nshouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend \ninto a badger.

Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry \ncould see that their heads were close together and they were hav-ing what looked like an absorbin g conversation.

He was walking toward them \nwhen something of what they were saying met his ears, and he \npaused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section. \n\u201cSo anyway,\u201d a stout boy was saying, \u201cI told Justin to hide up in \nour dormitory.

They called \nSlytherin himself Serpent-tongue.\u201d \nThere was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, \n\u201cRemember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Be-\nware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, \nFilch\u2019s cat\u2019s attacked.

In the end, \nProfessor McGonagall conjured a la rge fan out of thin air, which \nshe gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick \nup the stairs. This Ernie did, fann ing Nick along like a silent black \nhovercraft.

This wa s evidently a password, because \nthe gargoyle sprang suddenly to li fe and hopped aside as the wall \nbehind him split in two. Even fu ll of dread for what was coming, \nHarry couldn\u2019t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral stair-\ncase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and \nProfessor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud \nclosed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and \nhigher, until at last, slightly di zzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door \nahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin. \nHe knew now where he was bein g taken.

One thing was certain: of all the teachers\u2019 \noffices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore\u2019s was by far the most interesting. If he hadn\u2019t been scared out of his wits that he \nwas about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very \npleased to have a chance to look around it. \nIt was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little \nnoises. A number of curious silv er instruments stood on spindle-\nlegged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls \nwere covered with portraits of ol d headmasters and headmistresses, \nall of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an \nenormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a \nshabby, tattered wi zard\u2019s hat \u2014 the Sorting Hat. T"

Just to see . . . just to make sure it had \nput him in the right House \u2014 \nHe walked quietly around the desk , lifted the hat from its shelf, \nand lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and \nslipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he\u2019d put \nit on. Harry stared at the black in side of the hat, waiting. Then a \nsmall voice said in his ear, \u201cBee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?\u201d \n\u201cEr, yes,\u201d Harry muttered. \u201cEr \u2014 sorry to bother you \u2014 I \nwanted to ask \u2014\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,\u201d \nsaid the hat smartly. \u201cYes . . . you we re particularly difficult to place. \nBut I stand by what I said befo re\u201d \u2014 Harry\u2019s heart leapt \u2014 \u201cyou \nwould have done well in Slytherin \u2014\u201d \nHarry\u2019s stomach plummeted.

Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging \nnoise behind him made him wheel around. \nHe wasn\u2019t alone after all. Standi ng on a golden perch behind the \ndoor was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked \nturkey. Harry stared at it and th e bird looked balefully back, mak-\ning its gagging noise again. Harry thou ght it looked very ill.

Harry stepped for-\nward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold \nhim back. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cAre you crazy?\u201d said Ron. \u201cIt could be dangerous.\u201d \n\u201cDangerous ?\u201d said Harry, laughing. \u201cC ome off it, how could it be \ndangerous?\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d said Ron, who was looking apprehensively \nat the book. \u201cSome of the book s the Ministry\u2019s confiscated \u2014 \nDad\u2019s told me \u2014 there was one that burned your ey es out. And \n \nTHE VERY SECRET DIARY \n\u0091 231 \u0091 everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the \nrest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you \ncould never stop reading ! You just had to wander around with your \nnose in it, trying to do ev erything one-handed. And \u2014\u201d \n\u201cAll right, I\u2019ve got the point,\u201d said Harry. \nThe little book lay on the fl oor, nondescript and soggy. \n\u201cWell, we won\u2019t find out unless we look at it,\u201d he said, and he \nducked around Ron and pick ed it up off the floor. \nHarry saw at once that it was a di ary, and the faded year on the \ncover told him it was fifty years ol d. He opened it eagerly. On the \nfirst page he could just make out the name \u201cT. M. Riddle\u201d in smudged ink. \n\u201cHang on,\u201d said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was \nlooking over Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cI know that name. . . . T. M. Rid-\ndle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.\u201d \n\u201cHow on earth d\u2019you know that?\u201d said Harry in amazement. \u201cBecause Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in de-\ntention,\u201d said Ron resentfully. \u201cT hat was the one I burped slugs all \nover. If you\u2019d wiped slime off a na me for an hour, you\u2019d remember \nit, too.\u201d \nHarry peeled the wet pages apart. They were comp letely blank. \nThere wasn\u2019t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even \nAuntie Mabel\u2019s birthday, or dentist, half-past three. \n\u201cHe never wrote in it,\u201d sa id Harry, disappointed. \n\u201cI wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?\u201d said Ron cu-\nriously. \nHarry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed \nname of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London."

He\u2019d never had friends before \nHogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. \nNevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about \nRiddle, so next day at break, he he aded for the trophy room to ex-\namine Riddle\u2019s special award, accompanied by an interested Her-\nmione and a thoroughly unconvin ced Ron, who to ld them he\u2019d \nseen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. \nRiddle\u2019s burnished gold shield wa s tucked away in a corner cab-\ninet.

Perhaps the \nmonster, whatever it was, was ev en now settling itself down to hi-\nbernate for another fifty years. . . . \nErnie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn \u2019t take this cheerful view. He \nwas still convinced that Harry wa s the guilty one, that he had \n\u201cgiven himself away\u201d at the Duelin g Club.

Harry overheard him te lling Professor McGonagall so \nwhile the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. \n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019ll be any mo re trouble, Minerva,\u201d he said, \ntapping his nose knowingly and winking. \u201cI think the Chamber has been locked for good this time.

His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against \nthe little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was \ntilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, \ninto a whirl of color and shadow. \nHe felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the \nblurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus. \nHe knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the \nsleeping portraits was Dumbledore\u2019s office \u2014 but it wasn\u2019t \nDumbledore who was sitting behin d the desk. A wizened, frail-\nlooking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was read-\ning a letter by candleli ght.

The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his \nthumbs, watching the door. \nHarry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix \u2014 no \nwhirring silver contraptions.

The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of \nSlytherin \u2014 why don\u2019t th ey just chuck all the Slytherins out?\u201d he \nroared, to nods and scattered applause. \nPercy Weasley was sitting in a chai r behind Lee, but for once he \ndidn\u2019t seem keen to ma ke his views heard. He was looking pale and \nstunned. \n\u201cPercy\u2019s in shock,\u201d George told Harry quietly. \u201cThat Ravenclaw \ngirl \u2014 Penelope Clearwater \u2014 she\u2019s a prefect. I don\u2019t think he \nthought the monster wo uld dare attack a prefect. \u201d \nBut Harry was only half-listening. He didn\u2019t seem to be able to \nget rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as \nthough carved out of st one. And if the culprit wasn\u2019t caught soon, \nhe was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle \nhad turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a \nMuggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly \nhow he had felt. \n\u201cWhat\u2019re we going to do?\u201d said Ron quietly in Harry\u2019s ear. \n\u201cD\u2019you think they suspect Hagrid?\u201d \nCORNELIUS FUDGE \n\u0091 259 \u0091 \u201cWe\u2019ve got to go and talk to him,\u201d said Harry, making up his \nmind. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it\u2019s him this time, but if he set the monster \nloose last time he\u2019ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that\u2019s a start.\u201d \n\u201cBut McGonagall said we\u2019ve got to stay in our tower unless we\u2019re \nin class \u2014\u201d \n\u201cI think,\u201d said Harry, more quietly still, \u201cit\u2019s time to get my dad\u2019s \nold cloak out again.\u201d \n \nHarry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and sil-\nvery Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid with out anyone knowing about it. They \nwent to bed at the usual time, wa ited until Neville, Dean, and Sea-\nmus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally \nfallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over \nthemselves. \nThe journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors \nwasn\u2019t enjoyable. Harry, who had wa ndered the castle at night sev-\neral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach-\ners, prefects, and ghosts were ma rching the corridors in pairs, \nstaring around for any unusual ac tivity. Their Invisibility Cloak \ndidn\u2019t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly \ntense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot \nwhere Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at \nalmost exactly the moment Ron swor e. It was with relief that they \nreached the oak front door s and eased them open. \nIt was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows \nof Hagrid\u2019s house and pulled off the cloak only wh en they were \nright outside his front door."

Fred and George chal lenged Harry and Ron to a few \ngames of Exploding Snap, and Gi nny sat watching them, very sub-\ndued in Hermione\u2019s usua l chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on pur-\npose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well \npast midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. \nHarry and Ron waited for the dist ant sounds of two dormitory \ndoors closing before seizing the cloa k, throwing it over themselves, \nand climbing through the portrait hole. \nIt was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all \nthe teachers. At last th ey reached the entrance hall, slid back the \nlock on the oak front doors, squeez ed between them, trying to stop \nany creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. \n\u201c\u2019 C o u r s e , \u201d s a i d R o n a b r u p t l y a s they strode across the black \ngrass, \u201cwe might get to the forest and find there\u2019s nothing to follow. \nThose spiders might not\u2019ve been going there at all. I know it looked \nlike they were moving in that sort of general direction, but . . .\u201d \nHis voice trailed away hopefully. \nThey reached Hagrid\u2019s house, sad and sorry-looking with its \nblank windows. When Harry push ed the door open, Fang went \nmad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake \neveryone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily \nfed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued \nhis teeth together. \nHarry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid\u2019s table. There would \nbe no need for it in the pitch-dark forest."

Two \nsolitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the \nshade of the trees. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d Ron sighed as though resi gned to the worst, \u201cI\u2019m ready. \nLet\u2019s go.\u201d \nSo, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and \nleaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry\u2019s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They \nwalked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, lis-\ntening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. \nThen, when the trees had become thic ker than ever, so that the stars \noverhead were no longer visible, and Harry\u2019s wand shone alone in \nthe sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path. \nHarry paused, trying to see wher e the spiders were going, but \neverything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He \nhad never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly \nremember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time \nhe\u2019d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders. \n \nARAGOG \n\u0091 273 \u0091 Something wet touched Harry\u2019s ha nd and he jumped backward, \ncrushing Ron\u2019s foot, but it was only Fang\u2019s nose. \n\u201cWhat d\u2019you reckon?\u201d Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could \njust make out, reflecting the light from his wand. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve come this far,\u201d said Ron. \nSo they followed the darting sh adows of the spiders into the \ntrees. They couldn\u2019t move very quickly now; there were tree roots \nand stumps in their way, barely vi sible in the near blackness. Harry \ncould feel Fang\u2019s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crou ch down and find the spiders in \nthe wandlight. \nThey walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their \nrobes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, \nthey noticed that the ground se emed to be sloping downward, \nthough the trees were as thick as ever. \nThen Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making \nboth Harry and Ron jump out of their skins. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Ron loudly, lookin g around into the pitch-dark, \nand gripping Harry\u2019 s elbow very hard. \n\u201cThere\u2019s something moving over there,\u201d Harry breathed. \u201cLis-\nten . . . sounds like something big. . . .\u201d \nThey listened. Some distance to their right, the something big \nwas snapping branches as it ca rved a path through the trees. \n\u201cOh, no,\u201d said Ron. \u201cOh, no, oh, no, oh \u2014\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d said Harry franti cally. \u201cIt\u2019ll hear you.\u201d \n\u201cHear me?\u201d said Ron i n an unn at ura lly high voice. \u201cIt\u2019s already \nheard Fang!\u201d \nThe darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they"

He didn\u2019t move. His eyes were fixed on a point \nsome ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face \nwas livid with terror. \nHarry didn\u2019t even have time to turn around. There was a loud \nclicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize \nhim around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was \nhanging facedown.

Not tiny spiders like thos e surging over the leaves below. \nSpiders the size of carthorses, eigh t-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, \ngigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its \nway down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very \ncenter of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, click-\ning their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load. \nHarry fell to the ground on all fo urs as the spider released him. \nRon and Fang thudded down next to him.

His mouth was stretc hed wide in a kind of silent \nscream and his eyes were popping. \nHarry suddenly realized that th e spider that had dropped him \nwas saying something.

Ron, however, was looking happier than he\u2019d \nlooked in days. \n\u201cIt won\u2019t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!\u201d he said to \nHarry. \u201cHermione\u2019ll probably have all the answers when they wake \nher up! Mind you, she\u2019ll go crazy when she finds out we\u2019ve got ex-ams in three days\u2019 time. She hasn\u2019t studied. It might be kinder to \nleave her where she is till they\u2019r e over.\u201d \nJust then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. \nShe looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands \nwere twisting in her lap. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Ron, helpin g himself to more porridge. \nGinny didn\u2019t say anything, but glanced up and down the \nGryffindor table with a scared l ook on her face that reminded \nHarry of someone, though he couldn\u2019t think who. \n\u201cSpit it out,\u201d said Ron, watching her. \nHarry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rock-\ning backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby \ndid when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden in-\nformation."

While \nRon kept watch he tugged and twis ted, and at last , after several \ntense minutes, the paper came free. \nIt was a page torn from a ve ry old library book. Harry smoothed \nit out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too. \n \nOf the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, \nthere is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, \nknown also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may \nreach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken\u2019s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and ven-\nomous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who \nare fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. \nSpiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. \n \nAnd beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand \nHarry recognized as Hermione\u2019s.

Nick got the full blast of it, \nbut he couldn\u2019t die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw \nprefect were found with a mirror next to them.

Lockhart was standing well \nback, a look of utte r terror on his face. \nIt looked like an or dinary sink. They examined every inch of it, \ninside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: \nScratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake. \n\u201cThat tap\u2019s never worked,\u201d said My rtle brightly as he tried to \nturn it. \n\u201cHarry,\u201d said Ron. \u201cS ay something.

He stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it \nwas real. \n\u201cOpen up,\u201d he said. He looked at Ron, who shook his head. \n\u201cEnglish,\u201d he said. \nHarry looked back at the snake, wi lling himself to believe it was \nalive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though \nit were moving. \n\u201cOpen up,\u201d he said. \nExcept that the words weren\u2019t wh at he heard; a strange hissing \nhad escaped him, and at once the ta p glowed with a brilliant white \nlight and began to spin. Next seco nd, the sink began to move; the \nsink, in fact, sank, righ t out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a \npipe wide enough for a man to slide into. \nHarry heard Ron gasp and looked up again.

White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening. \n\u201cBoys,\u201d he said, his voice feeble. \u201cBoys, what good will it do?\u201d \nHarry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his \nlegs into the pipe. \n\u201cI really don\u2019t think \u2014\u201d he star ted to say, but Ron gave him a \npush, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered \nhimself slowly into the pipe, then let go. \nIt was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could \nsee more pipes branching off in al l directions, but none as large as \ntheirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and \nhe knew that he was falling deep er below the school than even the \ndungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the \ncurves. \nAnd then, just as he had begu n to worry about what would hap-\npen when he hit the ground, the pi pe leveled out, and he shot out \nof the end with a wet thud, landin g on the damp floor of a dark \nstone tunnel large enough to stand in.

The creature \nthat had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. \n\u201cBlimey,\u201d said Ron weakly. \nThere was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lock-\nhart\u2019s knees had given way. \n\u201cGet up,\u201d said Ron sharply, po inting his wand at Lockhart. \nLockhart got to his feet \u2014 then he dived at Ron, knocking him \nto the ground. \nHarry jumped forward, but too la te \u2014 Lockhart was straighten-\ning up, panting, Ron\u2019s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. \n\u201cThe adventure ends here, boys!\u201d he said. \u201cI shall take a bit of \nthis skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her \nmangled body \u2014 say good-by e to your memories!\u201d \nHe raised Ron\u2019s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, \n\u201cObliviate !\u201d \nThe wand exploded with the forc e of a small bomb. Harry flung \nhis arms over his head and ran, sli pping over the coils of snake skin, \nout of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thunder-\ning to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. \n\u201cRon!\u201d he shouted. \u201cAre you okay?

The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry\u2019s \nbody was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet \ndreaded what he\u2019d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept \naround yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two \nentwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting \nemeralds. \nTHE CHAMBER OF SECRETS \n\u0091 305 \u0091 Harry approached, his throat very dry.

Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved \nserpents rose to support a ceilin g lost in darkness, casting long, \nblack shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. \nHis heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill si-\nlence. Could the basilisk be lurk ing in a shadowy corner, behind a \npillar? And where was Ginny? \nHe pulled out his wand and moved forward between the ser-\npentine columns. Every careful f ootstep echoed loudly off the \nshadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them \nshut at the smallest sign of mo vement. The hollow eye sockets of \nthe stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with \na jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. \nThen, as he drew level wi th the last pair of pillars, a statue high as \nthe Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. \n H \nTHE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN \n\u0091 307 \u0091 Harry had to crane his nec k to look up into th e giant face above: \nIt was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell al-\nmost to the bottom of the wizard \u2019s sweeping stone robes, where \ntwo enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And \nbetween the feet, facedow n, lay a small, blac k-robed figure with \nflaming-red hair. \n\u201cGinny !\u201d Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his \nknees. \u201cGinny \u2014 don\u2019t be dead \u2014 please don\u2019t be dead \u2014\u201d He \nflung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny\u2019s shoulders, and turned her \nover.

Dear Tom, I can\u2019t remember what I did \non the night of Hallowee n, but a cat wa s attacked and I\u2019ve got paint \nall down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I\u2019m pale and I\u2019m \nnot myself. I think he suspects me. . . . There was another attack today \n \nTHE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN \n\u0091 311 \u0091 and I don\u2019t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think \nI\u2019m going mad . . . . I think I\u2019m the one attacking everyone, Tom !\u201d \nHarry\u2019s fists were clenched, th e nails digging deep into his \npalms. \n\u201cIt took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting \nher diary,\u201d said Riddle. \u201cBut sh e finally became suspicious and \ntried to dispose of it. And that\u2019s where you came in, Harry. You \nfound it, and I couldn\u2019t have been more delighted. Of all the people \nwho could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most \nanxious to meet. . . .\u201d \n\u201cAnd why did you want to meet me?\u201d said Harry. Anger was \ncoursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady. \n\u201cWell, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,\u201d said Rid-\ndle. \u201cYour whole fascinating history.\u201d His eyes roved over the light-\nning scar on Harry\u2019s forehead, an d their expression grew hungrier. \n\u201cI knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great \noaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust \u2014\u201d \n\u201cHagrid\u2019s my friend,\u201d said Harry, his voice now shaking. \u201cAnd \nyou framed him, didn\u2019t you?

It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I \ncould about the Chambe r of Secrets and disc over the secret en-\ntrance . . . as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power! \n\u201cOnly the Transfiguration teac her, Dumbledore, seemed to \nthink Hagrid was innocent.

What if, even \nworse, I told you who\u2019d been strang ling roosters? So the foolish lit-\ntle brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. \nBut I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin\u2019s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about \nyou, I knew you would go to an y lengths to solve the mystery \u2014 \nparticularly if one of y o u r b e s t f r i e n d s w a s attacked. And Ginny \nhad told me the whole school wa s buzzing because you could speak \nParseltongue. . . . \n\u201cSo I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come \ndown here to wait.

Then, as the music re ached such a pitch that Harry felt \nit vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the \nnearest pillar. \nA crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird \nmusic to the vaulted ceil ing.

On \nthe rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or \nwizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch \nor wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while \nenjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wen-delin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that \nshe allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-\nseven times in various disguises. \n \nHarry put his quill be tween his teeth and reached underneath \nhis pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and \nvery carefully he unscre wed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, \nand began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because \nif any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way \nto the bathroom, he\u2019d probably find himself locked in the cup-\nboard under the stairs for the rest of the summer. \nThe Dursley family of number four , Privet Drive, was the reason \nthat Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, \nAunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley , were Harry\u2019s only living rela-\ntives. They were Muggles, and th ey had a very medieval attitude \ntoward magic. Harry\u2019s dead pare nts, who had been a witch and \nwizard themselves, were never me ntioned under the Dursleys\u2019 roof. \nFor years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they \nkept Harry as downtr odden as possible, they would be able to \nsquash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuc-\ncessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that \nOWL POST \n\u0091 3 \u0091 Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of \nWitchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was \nto lock away Harry\u2019s spellbooks , wand, cauldron, and broomstick \nat the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the \nneighbors. \nThis separation from his spellb ooks had been a real problem for \nHarry, because his teache rs at Hogwarts had given him a lot of hol-\niday work. One of the essays, a pa rticularly nasty one about shrink-\ning potions, was for Harry\u2019s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, \nwho would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention \nfor a month. Harry had therefore seiz ed his chance in the first week \nof the holidays. While Uncle Vern on, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley \nhad gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon\u2019s new \ncompany car (in very lo ud voices, so that th e rest of the street \nwould notice it too), Harry had cr ept downstairs, picked the lock \non the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and \nhidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn\u2019t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need nev er know that he was studying \nmagic by night. \nHarry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and \nuncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad \nmood with him, all beca use he\u2019d received a te lephone call from a \nfellow wizard one week in to the school vacation. \nRon Weasley, who was one of Harry \u2019s best friends at Hogwarts, \ncame from a whole family of wizards.

The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, \nand he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one. \nHarry walked across the dark ro om, past Hedwig\u2019s large, empty \ncage, to the open window.

But then the \nbizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, \nand Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside. \nThrough the window soared three owls, two of them holding up \nthe third, which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a \nsoft flump on Harry\u2019s bed, and the middl e owl, which was large and \ngray, keeled right over and lay mo tionless.

Bill \nsays it\u2019s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn\u2019t reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn \u2019t realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup. \nBye \u2014 \n \n \nHarry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it \nstood quite still, balanced on it s point, reflecting the luminous \nhands of his clock. He looked at it happily for a fe w seconds, then \npicked up the parcel Hedwig had brought. \nOWL POST \n\u0091 11 \u0091 Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, \nthis time from Hermione. \n \nDear Harry, \nRon wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your \nUncle Vernon. I do hope you\u2019re all right. \nI\u2019m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn\u2019t \nknow how I was going to send this to you \u2014 what if they\u2019d \nopened it at customs? \u2014 but then Hedwig turned up! I \nthink she wanted to make sure you got something for your \nbirthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I\u2019ve \nbeen getting it delivered; it \u2019s so good to keep up with what \u2019s going on in the wizarding world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ag o? I bet he\u2019s learning loads. \nI\u2019m really jealous \u2014 the ancient Egyptian wizards were fas-\ncinating. \nThere\u2019s some interesting local history of witchcraft here, \ntoo. I\u2019ve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I\u2019ve found out. I hope it\u2019s not too long \u2014 \nit\u2019s two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for. \nRon says he \u2019s going to be in London in the last week of the \nholidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If no t, I\u2019ll see you on the Hogwarts \nExpress on September first! Love from \nHermonie"

Knowing Hermione, he was sure it \nwould be a large book full of very difficult spells \u2014 but it wasn \u2019 t. \nHis heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a \nsleek black leather case, with silv er words stamped across it, reading \nBroomstick Servicing Kit. \n\u201cWow, Hermione!\u201d Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look \ninside. \nThere was a large jar of Fleetwood \u2019s High-Finish Handle Polish, \na pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to \nclip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-\nYourself Broomcare. \nApart from his friends, the th ing that Harry missed most about \nHogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world \u2014 highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broom-sticks. Harry happened to be a ve ry good Quidditch player; he had \nbeen the youngest person in a cent ury to be picked for one of the \nHogwarts House teams. One of Ha rry\u2019s most prized possessions \nwas his Nimbus Two Thou sand racing broom. \nHarry put the leather case aside an d picked up his last parcel. He \nrecognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this \nwas from Hagrid, the Hogwarts ga mekeeper. He to re off the top \nlayer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but be-fore he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, \nand whatever was inside it snap ped loudly \u2014 as though it had \njaws. \nOWL POST \n\u0091 13 \u0091 Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him any-\nthing dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn\u2019t have a normal \nperson\u2019s view of what was dang erous. Hagrid had been known to \nbefriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in \npubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin. \nHarry poked the parcel n e r v o u s l y .

The book toppled off the bed wi th a loud clunk and shuffled \nrapidly across the room. Harry followe d it stealthily. The book was \nhiding in the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and \nreached toward it. \n\u201cOuch!\u201d \nThe book snapped shut on his ha nd and then flapped past him, \nstill scuttling on its covers.

The \nMonster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, \nso Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for Hagrid\u2019s card."

It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade \non weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he \nhad never set foot there. But ho w on earth was he going to per-\nsuade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form? \nHe looked over at the alarm cloc k. It was now two o\u2019clock in the \nmorning. \nDeciding that he\u2019d worry abou t the Hogsmeade form when he \nwoke up, Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off an-\nother day on the char t he\u2019d made for himse lf, counting down the \ndays left until his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses \nand lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday cards. \nExtremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter \nfelt just like everyone else \u2014 glad, for the first time in his life, that \nit was his birthday. \nC H A P T E R T W O \n \n\u0091 16 \u0091 AUNT MARGE\u2019S BIG MISTAKE \n \n \narry went down to breakfast th e next morning to find the \nthree Dursleys already sittin g around the kitchen table. \nThey were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-\nthe-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly \nabout the long walk between the frid ge and the television in the liv-\ning room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling \nas he ate continually. \nHarry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, \nbeefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from \nwishing Harry a happy birthday, no ne of the Dursleys made any \nsign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far \ntoo used to this to care. He help ed himself to a piece of toast and \nthen looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway \nthrough a report on an escaped convict: \n\u201c. . .

Look at his hair!\u201d \nHe shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had \nalways been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Com-\npared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was \nsurrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well \ngroomed indeed. \nThe reporter had reappeared. \n\u201cThe Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce to-\nday \u2014\u201d \n\u201cHang on!\u201d barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the re-\nporter. \u201cYou didn\u2019t tell us where that maniac\u2019s escaped from!

She didn\u2019t often stay at Privet Drive, because she \ncouldn\u2019t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood \nout horribly vividly in Harry\u2019s mind. \nAt Dudley\u2019s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked \nHarry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musica l statues. A few years later, she had turned \nup at Christmas with a computer ized robot for Dudley and a box \nof dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry \nstarted at Hogwarts, Harry had acci dentally trodden on the tail of \nher favorite dog.

Aunt \nMarge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, \nso that she could boom out sugge stions for his improvement. She \ndelighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge plea-\nsure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as \nthough daring him to ask why he hadn\u2019t got a present too. She also \nkept throwing out dark hints ab out what made Harry such an un-\nsatisfactory person. \n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t blame yourself for the way the boy\u2019s turned out, \nVernon,\u201d she said over lunch on th e third day. \u201cIf there\u2019s something \nrotten on the inside, there\u2019s nothing anyone can do about it.\u201d \nHarry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and \nhis face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form , he told \nhimself. Think about Hogsmeade. Don\u2019 t say anything. Don\u2019t rise \u2014 \nAunt Marge reached for her glass of wine. \n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the basic rules of breeding,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see it all \nthe time with dogs. If there\u2019s something wrong with the bitch, there\u2019ll be something wrong with the pup \u2014\u201d \nAt that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding ex-\nploded in her hand.

This worked quite well, though it seemed to \ngive him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the \nopinion that he was mentally subnormal. \nAt last, at long last, the final evening of Marge\u2019s stay arrived. \nAunt Petunia cooked a fancy di nner and Uncle Vernon uncorked \nseveral bottles of wine.

There was a little wiz-\nard gold in the money bag at the bo ttom of his trunk, but the rest \nof the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at \nGringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He\u2019d never be able to drag \nhis trunk all the way to London. Unless . . . \nHe looked down at his wand, whic h he was still clutching in his \nhand.

After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid fo r hot chocolate, but poured it \nall over Harry\u2019s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Angle-sey to Aberdeen.

Harry didn\u2019t ask for the price, but he returned, almost \nevery day after that , just to look at the Firebolt. \nThere were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went \nto the Apothecary to replenish hi s store of potions ingredients, \nand as his school robe s were now several inches too short in the \narm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin\u2019s Robes for All Occasions and \nbought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new \nschoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, \nCare of Magical Crea tures and Divination. \nHarry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. \nInstead of the usual display of go ld-embossed spellbooks the size of \npaving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn \npages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each \nother, locked together in furiou s wrestling matches and snapping \naggressively. \nHarry pulled his bookli st out of his pocket and consulted it for \nthe first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the re-\nquired book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry under-\nstood why Hagrid had said it w o u l d c o m e i n u s e f u l . H e f e l t \nrelieved; he had been wondering wh ether Hagrid wanted help with \nsome terrifying new pet. \nAs Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurry-\ning toward him. \n\u201cHogwarts?\u201d he said abruptly. \u201cCome to get your new books?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry, \u201cI need \u2014\u201d \nTHE LEAKY CAULDRON \n\u0091 53 \u0091 \u201cGet out of the way,\u201d said the manager impatiently, brushing \nH a r r y a s i d e .

I\u2019ve been bitten five times already \nthis morning \u2014\u201d \nA loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had \nseized a third and were pulling it apart. \n\u201cStop it! Stop it!\u201d cried the manager, poking the walking stick \nthrough the bars and knocking the books apart. \u201cI\u2019m never stocking \nthem again, never! It\u2019s been bedlam ! I thought we\u2019d seen the worst \nwhen we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisi-\nbility \u2014 cost a fortune, and we never found them. . . .

A small table was \nstacked with volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate \nYourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn \nFoul. \n\u201cHere you are,\u201d said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps \nto take down a thick, black-bound book. \u201c Unfogging the Future. \nVery good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods \u2014 palm-\nistry, crystal balls, bird entrails \u2014\u201d \nBut Harry wasn\u2019t listening.

Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Th omas, his fellow Gryffindors, in \nQuality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Fire-\nbolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, \nforgetful boy, outside Flourish an d Blotts. Harry di dn\u2019t stop to \nchat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable -looking grandmother. Harry hoped \nshe never found out that he\u2019d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic. \nHarry woke on the last day of the holidays, thin king that he \nwould at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hog-warts Express.

Every inch of wall was hidden \nby cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of \nthese cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. \nThe witch behind the counter was al ready advising a wizard on the \ncare of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, \nexamining the cages. \nA pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting \non dead blowflies. A gi gantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell \nwas glittering near the window. Po isonous orange snails were ooz-\ning slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept \nchanging into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping \nnoise. Then there were cats of ever y color, a noisy cage of ravens, a \nbasket of funny custard-colore d furballs that were humming \nloudly, and on the counter, a vast ca ge of sleek black rats that were \nplaying some sort of skipping ga me using their long, bald tails. \nThe double-ended newt wizard l eft, and Ron approached the \ncounter. \n\u201cIt\u2019s my rat,\u201d he told the witch. \u201cHe been a bit off-color ever \nsince I brought him back from Egypt.\u201d \n\u201cBang him on the counter,\u201d said the witch, pulling a pair of \nheavy black spectacles out of her pocket. \nRon lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next \nto the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look. \nLike nearly everything Ron owned , Scabbers the rat was second-\nhand (he had once belonged to Ron\u2019s brother Percy) and a bit \nTHE LEAKY CAULDRON \n\u0091 59 \u0091 battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially \nwoebegone. \n\u201cHm,\u201d said the witch, picking up Scabbers. \u201cHow old is this \nrat?\u201d \n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Ron. \u201cQuite old. He used to belong to my \nbrother.\u201d \n\u201cWhat powers does he have?\u201d sa id the witch, examining Scab-\nbers closely. \n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the \nfaintest trace of inte resting powers. The witc h\u2019s eyes moved from \nScabbers\u2019s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe miss-\ning, and tutted loudly. \n\u201cHe\u2019s been through the mi ll, this one,\u201d she said. \n\u201cHe was like that when Percy gave him to me,\u201d said Ron defen-\nsively. \n\u201cAn ordinary common or garden rat like this can\u2019t be expected to \nlive longer than three years or so ,\u201d said the witch. \u201cNow, if you \nwere looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might \nlike one of these \u2014\u201d \nShe indicated the blac k rats, who promptly started skipping \nagain.

One by one they \nmade their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were nex t door to Harry. He had just \nclosed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on. \nThe door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting. \n\u201cIt was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing \u2014\u201d \n\u201cI haven\u2019t touched it, all right?\u201d Ron roared back. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s up?\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cMy Head Boy badge is gone,\u201d sa id Percy, rounding on Harry. \n\u201cSo\u2019s Scabbers\u2019s rat tonic,\u201d said Ron, throwing things out of his \ntrunk to look. \u201cI think I might\u2019ve left it in the bar \u2014\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re not going anywhere till you\u2019ve found my badge!\u201d yelled \nPercy. \n\u201cI\u2019ll get Scabbers\u2019s stuff, I\u2019m pack ed,\u201d Harry said to Ron, and he \nwent downstairs. \nHarry was halfway along the passag e to the bar, which was now \nvery dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from \nthe parlor. A second later, he re cognized them as Mr. and Mrs. \n \nTHE LEAKY CAULDRON \n\u0091 65 \u0091 Weasleys\u2019. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he\u2019d heard \nthem arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, \nthen move closer to the parlor door. \n\u201c. . . makes no sense not to tell him,\u201d Mr. Weasley was saying \nheatedly. \u201cHarry\u2019s got a right to kn ow. I\u2019ve tried to tell Fudge, but \nhe insists on treating Harry like a child. He\u2019s thirteen years old \nand \u2014\u201d \n\u201cArthur, the truth would terrify him!\u201d said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \n\u201cDo you really want to send Harry back to school with that hang-\ning over him? For heaven\u2019s sake, he\u2019s happy not knowing!\u201d \n\u201cI don \u2019 t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his \nguard!\u201d retorted Mr. Weasley. \u201cYou know what Harry and Ron are \nlike, wandering off by themselves \u2014 they\u2019ve even ended up in the \nForbidden Forest! But Harry must n\u2019t do that this year! When I \nthink what could have happened to him that night he ran away \nfrom home! If the Knight Bus hadn \u2019t picked him up, I\u2019m prepared \nto bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.\u201d \n\u201cBut he\u2019s not dead, he\u2019s fine, so what\u2019s the point \u2014\u201d \n\u201cMolly, they say Sirius Black\u2019s mad, and maybe he is, but he was \nclever enough to escape from Azka ban, and that\u2019s supposed to be \nimpossible. It\u2019s been a month, an d no one\u2019s seen hide nor hair of \nhim, and I don\u2019t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, \nwe\u2019re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for su re is what Black\u2019s after \u2014\u201d \n\u201cBut Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\u201d \n\u201cWe thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out \nof Azkaban, he can br eak into Hogwarts.\u201d \n\u201cBut no one\u2019s really sure that Black\u2019s after Harry \u2014\u201d"

They didn\u2019t report \nit in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went \nout to Azkaban the night Black es caped. The guards told Fudge \nthat Black\u2019s been talking in his sl eep for a while now. Always the \nsame words: \u2018He\u2019s at Hogwarts . . . he\u2019s at Hogwarts.\u2019 Black is de-ranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks \nmurdering Harry will brin g You-Know-Who back to power.

As quie tly as he could, he hurried \ndown the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door \nopened, and a few seconds later f ootsteps told him that Mr. and \nMrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs. \nThe bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at \nearlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\u2019s bed-\nroom door close, then headed ba ck upstairs with the bottle. \nFred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, \nheaving with laughter as they list ened to Percy dismantling his and \nRon\u2019s room in search of his badge. \n\u201cWe\u2019ve got it,\u201d Fred whispered to Harry. \u201cWe\u2019ve been improv-\ning it.\u201d \nThe badge now read Bighead Boy. \nHarry forced a laugh, went to gi ve Ron the rat tonic, then shut \nhimself in his room and lay down on his bed. \nSo Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge \nhad been lenient with him because he was so re lieved to find him \nalive. He\u2019d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where \nthere were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him.

Sirius Black had murdered \nthirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously \nthought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth.

Only \nthose who had been in the compartment on th e train with Profes-\nsor Lupin clapped hard, Harry among them.

It was common knowledge that Snape \nwanted the Defense Against the Da rk Arts job, but even Harry, \nwho hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, \nsallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that \nexpression only too well; it was th e look Snape wore every time he \nset eyes on Harry. \n\u201cAs to our second new appointment,\u201d Dumbledore continued as \nthe lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away. \u201cWell, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical \nCreatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy \nmore time with his remaining limb s. However, I am delighted to \nsay that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, \nwho has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his \ngamekeeping duties.\u201d \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione star ed at one another, stunned. \nThen they joined in with the ap plause, which was tumultuous at \nthe Gryffindor table in particul ar. Harry leaned forward to see \nHagrid, who was ruby-red in the fa ce and staring down at his enor-\nmous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard. \n\u201cWe should\u2019ve known!\u201d Ron roared , pounding the table. \u201cWho \nelse would have assigned us a biting book?\u201d \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and \nas Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that \nHagrid was wiping his ey es on the tablecloth. \n\u201cWell, I think that\u2019s everything of importance,\u201d said Dumble-\ndore. \u201cLet the feast begin!\u201d \nThe golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with"

Harry, Ro n, and Hermione, how-\never, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. \nThey knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him. \nHagrid wasn\u2019t a fully qualified wi zard; he had been expelled from \nHogwarts in his third year for a crime he ha d not committed. It \nhad been Harry, Ron, and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid\u2019s \nname last year. \nAt long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted \nfrom the golden platte rs, Dumbledore gave the word that it was \ntime for them all to go to be d, and they got their chance. \n\u201cCongratulations, Hagrid!\u201d Hermione squealed as they reached \nthe teachers\u2019 table. \n\u201cAll down ter you three,\u201d said Hagr id, wiping his shining face on \nhis napkin as he looked up at them . \u201cCan\u2019 believe it . . . great man, \nDumbledore . . . came straight down to me hut after Professor \nKettleburn said he\u2019d had enough. . . .

As they passed, Malfoy did a \nridiculous impression of a swoon ing fit and there was a roar of \nlaughter. \n\u201cIgnore him,\u201d said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. \n\u201cJust ignore him, it\u2019s not worth it. . . .\u201d \n\u201cHey, Potter!\u201d shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a \nface like a pug. \u201cPotter!

And he said it was the worst \nplace he\u2019d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking. . . . They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors.

Feeling \nslightly more cheerful, Harry help ed himself to sausages and fried \ntomatoes. \nHermione was examining her new schedule. \n\u201cOoh, good, we\u2019re starting some new subjects today,\u201d she said \nhappily."

It was nothing like a broomstick, \nand Harry knew which one he pr eferred; the hippogriff\u2019s wings \nbeat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his \nlegs and making him feel he was ab out to be thrown off; the glossy \nfeathers slipped under his fingers an d he didn\u2019t dare get a stronger \ngrip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, \nhe now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquar-\nters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings. \nBuckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed \nback to the ground; this was th e bit Harry had been dreading; he \nleaned back as the smooth neck lo wered, feeling he was going to \nslip off over the beak, then felt a he avy thud as the four ill-assorted \nfeet hit the ground. He just manage d to hold on and push himself \nstraight again. \n\u201cGood work, Harry!\u201d roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, \nCrabbe, and Goyle cheered. \u201cO kay, who else wants a go?\u201d \nEmboldened by Harry\u2019s success, the rest of the class climbed \ncautiously into the paddock. Hagr id untied the hippogriffs one by \none, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. \nN e v i l l e r a n r e p e a t e d l y b a c k w a r d f r o m h i s , w h i c h d i d n \u2019 t s e e m t o want to bend its knees.

They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and parchment, an d were talking when he finally en-\ntered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher\u2019s desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked \nhealthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals. \n\u201cGood afternoon,\u201d he said. \u201cWould you please put all your \nbooks back in your bags. Today\u2019s wi ll be a practical lesson. You will \nneed only your wands.\u201d \nA few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their \nbooks. They had never had a prac tical Defense Against the Dark \nArts before, unless you counted th e memorable class last year when \ntheir old teacher had brought a cage ful of pixies to class and set \nthem loose. \n\u201cRight then,\u201d said Professor Lupi n, when everyone was ready. \u201cIf \nyou\u2019d follow me.\u201d \nPuzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Pro-\nfessor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted \n \nTHE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE \n\u0091 131 \u0091 corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was \nPeeves the Poltergeist, who was floa ting upside down in midair and \nstuffing the nearest keyh ole with chewing gum. \nPeeves didn\u2019t look up until Pr ofessor Lupin was two feet away; \nthen he wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song. \n\u201cLoony, loopy Lupin,\u201d Peeves sang . \u201cLoony, loopy Lupin, loony, \nloopy Lupin \u2014\u201d \nRude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually \nshowed some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, \nhe was still smiling. \n\u201cI\u2019d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,\u201d he \nsaid pleasantly. \u201cMr. Filch won\u2019t be able to get in to his brooms.\u201d \nFilch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard \nwho waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. \nHowever, Peeves paid no attentio n to Professor Lupin\u2019s words, ex-\ncept to blow a lo ud wet raspberry. \nProfessor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand. \n\u201cThis is a useful little spell,\u201d he told the class over his shoulder. \n\u201cPlease watch closely.\u201d \nHe raised the wand to shoulder height, said, \u201c Waddiwasi !\u201d and \npointed it at Peeves. \nWith the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of \nthe keyhole and straight down Peeves \u2019s left nostril; he whirled up-\nright and zoomed away, cursing. \n\u201cCool, sir!\u201d said Dean Thomas in amazement. \u201c T h a n k y o u , D e a n , \u201d s a i d P r o f essor Lupin, putting his wand \naway again. \u201cShall we proceed?\u201d"

He led them down a second corridor and \nstopped, right outsid e the staffroom door. \n\u201cInside, please,\u201d said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing \nback. \nThe staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched \nchairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sit-\nting in a low armchair, and he look ed around as the class filed in. \nHis eyes were glittering and ther e was a nasty sneer playing around \nhis mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door \nbehind him, Snape said, \u201cLeave it open, Lupin. I\u2019d rather not wit-ness this.\u201d \nHe got to his feet and strode pa st the class, his black robes bil-\nlowing behind him. At th e doorway he turned on his heel and said, \n\u201cPossibly no one\u2019s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains \nNeville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with \nanything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions \nin his ear.\u201d \nNeville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough \nthat he bullied Neville in his own cl asses, let alone doing it in front \nof other teachers. \nProfessor Lupin had ra ised his eyebrows. \n\u201cI was hoping that Neville would a ssist me with the first stage of \nthe operation,\u201d he said, \u201cand I am sure he will perform it ad-mirably.\u201d \nNeville\u2019s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape\u2019s lip curled, \nbut he left, shutting the door with a snap. \n\u201cNow, then,\u201d said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward \nthe end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe \nTHE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE \n\u0091 133 \u0091 where the teachers kept their spar e robes. As Professor Lupin went \nto stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off \nthe wall. \n\u201cNothing to worry about,\u201d said Professor Lupin calmly because \na few people had jumped backward in alarm. \u201cThere\u2019s a boggart in there.\u201d \nMost people seemed to feel that this was something to worry \nabout. Neville gave Professor Lu pin a look of pure terror, and \nSeamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively. \n\u201cBoggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,\u201d said Professor Lupin. \n\u201cWardrobes, the gap beneath beds , the cupboards under sinks \u2014 \nI\u2019ve even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This \none moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if \nthe staff would leave it to give my third years some practice. \n\u201cSo, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a bog-\ngart?\u201d \nHermione put up her hand. \n\u201cIt\u2019s a shape-shifter,\u201d she said. \u201cI t can take the shape of whatever \nit thinks will frighten us most.\u201d \n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have put it better myse lf,\u201d said Professor Lupin, and \nHermione glowed. \u201cSo the boggart sitting in the darkness within \nhas not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will \nfrighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows \nwhat a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, \nhe will immediately become what ever each of us most fears. \n\u201cThis means,\u201d said Professor Lupi n, choosing to ignore Neville\u2019s \nsmall sputter of terror, \u201cthat we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Ha ve you spotted it, Harry?\u201d \nTrying to answer a question with Hermione next to him,"

Can you see them in your mind\u2019s eye?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering what was \ncoming next. \n\u201cWhen the boggart bursts out of t his wardrobe, Neville, and sees \nyou, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cAnd \nyou will raise your wand \u2014 thus \u2014 and cry \u2018 Riddikulus \u2019 \u2014 and \nconcentrate hard on your grandmot her\u2019s clothes.

The \nstory of the boggart assuming Sn ape\u2019s shape, and the way that \nNeville had dresse d it in his grandmother\u2019 s clothes, had traveled \nthrough the school like wildfire.

He couldn\u2019t like \nProfessor Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bor-\ndering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Laven-\nder Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney\u2019s tower room \nat lunchtimes, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks \non their faces, as though they kn ew things the others didn\u2019t. They \nhad also started using hushed voic es whenever they spoke to Harry, \nas though he were on his deathbed. \nNobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the \naction-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid \nseemed to have lost his confidenc e. They were now spending lesson \nafter lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to \nbe some of the most boring creatures in existence. \n\u201cWhy would anyone bother looking after them?\u201d said Ron, after \nyet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobber-worms\u2019 slimy throats. \nAt the start of October, however, Harry had something else to \noccupy him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his \nFLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY \n\u0091 143 \u0091 unsatisfactory classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and \nOliver Wood, Captain of the G ryffindor team, called a meeting \none Thursday evening to discu ss tactics for the new season. \nThere were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, \nwhose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, \nsoccer-sized ball) thro ugh one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each \nend of the field; two Beaters, wh o were equipped with heavy bats \nto repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around \ntrying to attack the players); a Keeper, who de fended the goal \nposts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catch-\ning the Golden Snitch, a tiny, wi nged, walnut-sized ball, whose \ncapture ended the game and earned the Seeker\u2019s team an extra one \nhundred and fifty points. \nOliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh \nand final year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly \nlocker rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field. \n\u201cThis is our last chance \u2014 my last chance \u2014 to win the Quid-\nditch Cup,\u201d he told them, striding up and down in front of them. \n\u201cI\u2019ll be leaving at the end of this year.

Could \nyou leave it here on the desk for me?\u201d \nSnape set down the smoking gobl et, his eyes wandering between \nHarry and Lupin. \n\u201cI was just showing Harry my grin dylow,\u201d said Lupin pleasantly, \npointing at the tank. \n\u201cFascinating,\u201d said Snape, without looking at it. \u201cYou should \ndrink that dire ctly, Lupin.\u201d \n\u201cYes, yes, I will ,\u201d said Lupin. \n\u201cI made an entire cauldronful, \u201d Snape continued. \u201cIf you need \nmore.\u201d \n\u201cI should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very \nmuch, Severus.\u201d \n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Snape, but th ere was a look in his eye Harry \ndidn\u2019t like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful. \nHarry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled. \n\u201cProfessor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,\u201d he \n \nFLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY \n\u0091 157 \u0091 said. \u201cI have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is \nparticularly complex.\u201d He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. \u201cPity \nsugar makes it useless,\u201d he adde d, taking a sip and shuddering. \n\u201cWhy \u2014 ?\u201d Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the \nunfinished question. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been feeling a bit off-color,\u201d he said. \u201cThis potion is the \nonly thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Pro-\nfessor Snape; there aren\u2019t many wi zards who are up to making it.\u201d \nProfessor Lupin took another si p and Harry had a crazy urge to \nknock the goblet out of his hands. \n\u201cProfessor Snape\u2019s very interested in the Dark Arts,\u201d he blurted \nout. \n\u201cReally?\u201d said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took \nanother gulp of potion. \n\u201cSome people reckon \u2014\u201d Harry hesitated, then plunged reck-\nlessly on, \u201csome people reckon he\u2019d do anything to get the Defense \nAgainst the Dark Arts job.\u201d \nLupin drained the goblet and pulled a face. \n\u201cDisgusting,\u201d he said. \u201cWell, Harry, I\u2019d better get back to work. \nI\u2019ll see you at the feast later.\u201d \n\u201cRight,\u201d said Harry, putt ing down his empty teacup. \nThe empty goblet was still smoking. \n \n\u201cThere you go,\u201d said Ron. \u201cWe go t as much as we could carry.\u201d \nA shower of brilliantly colored sw eets fell into Harry\u2019s lap. It was \ndusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common \nroom, pink-faced from the cold wi nd and looking as though they\u2019d \nhad the time of their lives."

It had been decorated with hundreds \nand hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live \nbats, and many flaming orange st reamers, which were swimming \nlazily across the stormy ceiling like brillian t watersnakes. \nThe food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full \nto bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin \nlooked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he wa s talking animat-\nedly to tiny little Professor Fl itwick, the Charms teacher. Harry \nmoved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was \nhe imagining it, or were Snape\u2019s eyes flickering toward Lupin more \noften than was natural? \nThe feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hog-\nwarts ghosts. They popped out of th e walls and tables to do a bit of \nformation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched be-heading. \nIt had been such a pleasant evening that Ha rry\u2019s good mood \ncouldn\u2019t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the \ncrowd as they all left the hall, \u201cThe dementors send their love, \nPotter!\u201d \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors \nalong the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ende d with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they \nfound it jammed with students. \n\u201cWhy isn\u2019t anyone going in ?\u201d said Ron curiously. \nHarry peered over the heads in front of him.

Now he could definitely he ar voices, not to mention the tin-\nkle of a bell and the openin g and shutting of a door. \nWondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open \nmuch closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs. \n\u201cAnd get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they\u2019ve nearly cleaned \nus out \u2014\u201d said a woman\u2019s voice. \nA pair of feet was coming down th e staircase. Harry leapt behind \nan enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard \nthe man shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get \nanother chance \u2014 \nQuickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place \nand climbed the stairs; looking ba ck, he saw an enormous backside \nand shiny bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the \ntop of the stairs, slipped throug h it, and found himself behind the \ncounter of Honeydukes \u2014 he duck ed, crept sideways, and then \nstraightened up. \n \nTHE MARAUDER\u2019S MAP \n\u0091 197 \u0091 Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts stud ents that no \none looked twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking \naround, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley\u2019s piggy face if he could see where Harry was \nnow. \nThere were shelves upon shelve s of the most succulent-looking \nsweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink \nsquares of coconut ice, fat, hone y-colored toffees; hundreds of dif-\nferent kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitat-\ning sherbert balls that Ron ha d mentioned; along yet another \nw a l l w e r e \u201c S p e c i a l E f f e c t s \u201d s w e e t s : D r o o b l e \u2019 s B e s t B l o w i n g G u m (which filled a room with bluebell- colored bubbles that refused to \npop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (\u201cbreathe fire for your friends!\u201d), Ice Mice \n(\u201chear your teeth chatter and squeak!\u201d), peppermint creams shaped like toads (\u201chop realistically in the stomach!\u201d), fragile sugar-spun \nquills, and exploding bonbons. \nHarry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw \na sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop ( Unusual Tastes ). \nRon and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray \nof blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them. \n\u201cUgh, no, Harry won\u2019t want one of those, they\u2019re for vampires, I \nexpect,\u201d Hermione was saying. \n\u201cHow about these?\u201d said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clus-\nters under Hermione\u2019s nose. \n\u201cDefinitely not,\u201d said Harry. \nRon nearly dropped the jar."

I was Junior Mini ster in the Department of Mag-\nical Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on the scene \nafter Black murdered all those peop le. I \u2014 I will nev er forget it. I \nstill dream about it sometimes. A cr ater in the middle of the street, \nso deep it had cracked the sewe r below. Bodies everywhere. Mug-\ngles screaming.

The murder of \nPettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and \ndesperate man \u2014 cruel . . . pointle ss. Yet I met Black on my last \ninspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there \nsit muttering to themselves in the dark; there\u2019s no sense in \nthem . . . but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He \nspoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You\u2019d have thought he was merely bored \u2014 asked if I\u2019d finished with my newspaper, \ncool as you please, said he misse d doing the crossword. Yes, I was \nastounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having \non him \u2014 and he was one of the mo st heavily guarded in the place, \nyou know. Dementors outsid e his door day and night.\u201d \n\u201cBut what do you think he\u2019s broken out to do?\u201d said Madam \nRosmerta. \u201cGood gracious, Minister, he isn\u2019t trying to rejoin You-\nKnow-Who, is he?\u201d \n\u201cI daresay that is his \u2014 er \u2014 eventual plan,\u201d said Fudge eva-\ns i v e l y . \u201c B u t w e h o p e t o c a t c h B l a c k long before that.

H e d o e s n \u2019 t h a v e t o h e a r m y m u m \nscreaming if they get too close \u2014 \nHarry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back \ninto his cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, \nmaking sure the hangings we re hiding him from view. \nThe dormitory door opened. \n\u201cHarry?\u201d said Ron\u2019s voice uncertainly. \n \nTHE FIREBOLT \n\u0091 213 \u0091 But Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep.

He co uld see Black laughing at him \nthrough the darkness, as though somebody had pasted the picture \nfrom the album over his eyes. He watched, as though somebody \nwas playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Petti-\ngrew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. \nHe could hear (though having no idea what Black\u2019s voice might \nsound like) a low, excited mu tter. \u201cIt has happened, My \nLord . . . the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper. . . .\u201d And \nthen came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that \nHarry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew \nnear. . . . \n \n\u201cHarry, you \u2014 you look terrible.\u201d \nHarry hadn\u2019t gotten to sleep unti l daybreak.

Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and \naimed a misjudged kick at Crooks hanks that hit the trunk at the \nend of Harry\u2019s bed, kn ocking it over and causing Ron to hop up \nand down, howling with pain. \nCrookshanks\u2019s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tinny \nwhistling was filling the room.

And despite Ron\u2019s frequent com-\nTHE FIREBOLT \n\u0091 227 \u0091 plaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron \nwould be very miserable if Scabbers died. \nChristmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the \nGryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut \nCrookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying \nto kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks\u2019s fresh at-\ntempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to \neach other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the commo n room with him. For some \nreason this seemed to annoy Herm ione as well; she didn\u2019t say any-\nthing, but she kept lo oking darkly at the br oom as though it too \nhad been criticizing her cat. \nAt lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the \nHouse tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a sin-\ngle table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors \nDumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown \ncoat and was wearing a very old an d rather moldy-looking tailcoat. \nThere were only three other stud ents, two extremely nervous-looking \nfirst years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year. \n\u201cMerry Christmas!\u201d said Dumb ledore as Harry, Ron, and \nHermione approached th e table. \u201cAs there are so few of us, it \nseemed foolish to use the House ta bles. . . .

It\u2019s the nearest we\u2019ll get \nto a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he \nsees you, so we\u2019ll be able to practice on him.

It is called the Patronus Charm.\u201d \n\u201cHow does it work?\u201d said Harry nervously. \u201cWell, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,\u201d said \nLupin, \u201cwhich is a kind of anti-dementor \u2014 a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.\u201d \nHarry had a sudden vision of himse lf crouching behind a Hagrid-\nsized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, \u201cThe \nPatronus is a kind of positive forc e, a projection of the very things \nthat the dementor feeds upon \u2014 hope, happiness, the desire to \nsurvive \u2014 but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the de-\nmentors can\u2019t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm \nmight be too advanced for you. Ma ny qualified wizards have diffi-\nculty with it.\u201d \n\u201cWhat does a Patronus look li ke?\u201d said Harry curiously. \n\u201cEach one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.\u201d \n\u201cAnd how do you conjure it?\u201d \n\u201cWith an incantation, which will work only if you are concen-\ntrating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.\u201d \nHarry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing \nthat had happened to h im at the Dursleys\u2019 was going to do. Finally, he \nsettled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick. \n\u201cRight,\u201d he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the won-\nderful, soaring sensat ion of his stomach."

You \naren\u2019t passing out anymore, are you?\u201d \n\u201cI thought a Patronus would \u2014 charge the dementors down or \nsomething,\u201d said Harry dispirit edly. \u201cMake them disappear \u2014\u201d \n\u201cThe true Patronus does do that,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cBut you\u2019ve \nachieved a great deal in a very sh ort space of time. If the dementors \nput in an appear ance at your next Quiddi tch match, you will be \nable to keep them at bay long en ough to get back to the ground.\u201d \n\u201cYou said it\u2019s harder if there are loads of them,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI have complete confidence in you,\u201d said Lupin, smiling. \n\u201cHere \u2014 you\u2019ve earned a drink \u2014 something from the Three Broomsticks.

Not \nthat I\u2019m supposed to take sides, as a teacher . . . ,\u201d he added hastily. \nThey drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced some-\nthing he\u2019d been wond ering for a while. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s under a de mentor\u2019s hood?\u201d \n \nTHE PATRONUS \n\u0091 247 \u0091 Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully. \n\u201cHmmm . . . well, the only people who rea lly know are in no \ncondition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to \nuse its last and worst weapon.\u201d \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cThey call it the Dementor\u2019s Kiss,\u201d said Lupin, with a slightly \ntwisted smile. \u201cIt\u2019s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy \nutterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim \nand \u2014 and suck out his soul.\u201d \nHarry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer. \u201cWhat \u2014 they kill \u2014 ?\u201d \n\u201cOh no,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cMuch wors e than that. You can exist with-\nout your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still \nworking. But you\u2019ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, \nno . . . anything. There\u2019s no chance at all of recovery. You\u2019ll just \u2014 \nexist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever . . . lost.\u201d \nLupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, \u201cIt\u2019s the fate that \nawaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The \nMinistry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they \nfind him.\u201d \nHarry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having \ntheir soul sucked out through thei r mouth. But then he thought of \nBlack. \n\u201cHe deserves it,\u201d he said suddenly. \n\u201cYou think so?\u201d said Lupin lightly. \u201cDo you really think anyone \ndeserves that?\u201d \n\u201cYes,\u201d said Harry defi antly. \u201cFor . . . for some things . . .\u201d"

It\u2019s \u2014\u201d \nBut exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never \nfound out. At that precise mome nt, a strangled ye ll echoed down \nthe boys\u2019 staircase. The whole co mmon room fell silent, staring, \npetrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing \nlouder and louder \u2014 and then Ron came leaping into view, drag-\nging with him a bedsheet. \n\u201cLOOK!\u201d he bellowed, striding over to Hermione\u2019s table. \n\u201cLOOK!\u201d he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face. \n\u201cRon, what \u2014 ?\u201d \n\u201cSCABBERS!

Something that looked horribly like \u2014 \n\u201cBLOOD!\u201d Ron yelled into the stunned silence. \u201cHE\u2019S GONE! \nAND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?\u201d \n\u201cN \u2014 no,\u201d said Hermione in a trembling voice. \nRon threw something down onto Hermione\u2019s rune translation. \nHermione and Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs. \nC H A P T E R T H I R T E E N \n \n\u0091 252 \u0091 GR YFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW \n \n \nt looked like the end of Ron and Hermione\u2019s friendship. Each \nwas so angry with the other that Harry couldn\u2019t see how they\u2019d \never make up. \nRon was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks\u2019s \nattempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn\u2019t bothered to keep a close \nenough watch on him, and was stil l trying to pretend that Crook-\nshanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers un-\nder all the boys\u2019 beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely \nthat Ron had no proof that Crook shanks had eaten Scabbers, that \nthe ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that \nRon had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks \nhad landed on Ron\u2019s head in the Magical Menagerie. \nPersonally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scab-\nbers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence \nall pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too. \n I \nGRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW \n\u0091 253 \u0091 \u201cOkay, side with Ron, I knew you would!\u201d she said shrilly. \u201cFirst \nthe Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything\u2019 s my fault, isn\u2019t it! Just leave \nme alone, Harry, I\u2019ve go t a lot of work to do!\u201d \nRon had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed. \n\u201cCome on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers \nwas,\u201d said Fred bracingly \u201cAnd he \u2019s been off-color for ages, he was \nwasting away. It was probably bett er for him to snuff it quickly \u2014 \none swallow \u2014 he probably didn\u2019t feel a thing.\u201d \n\u201cFred!\u201d said Ginny indignantly. \n\u201cAll he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,\u201d said \nGeorge. \n\u201cHe bit Goyle for us once!\u201d Ro n said miserably. \u201cRemember, \nHarry?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true ,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cHis finest hour,\u201d said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. \u201cLet \nthe scar on Goyle\u2019s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. \nOh, come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a \nnew rat, what\u2019s the point of moaning?\u201d \nIn a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to \ncome along to the Gryffindor te am\u2019s final practice before the \nRavenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after \nthey\u2019d finished. This did seem to take Ron\u2019s mind off Scabbers for \na moment (\u201cGreat! Can I try and sh oot a few goals on it?\u201d) so they \nset off for the Quiddi tch field together. \nMadam Hooch, who was still overs eeing Gryffindor practices to \nkeep an eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as \neveryone else had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion."

The \nRavenclaw team, dressed in blue, we re already standing in the mid-\ndle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their \nteam. She was shorter than Harr y by about a head, and Harry \ncouldn\u2019t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely \npretty. She smiled at Harry as th e teams faced each other behind \ntheir captains, and he fe lt a slight lurch in th e region of his stom-\nach that he didn\u2019t think ha d anything to do with nerves. \n\u201cWood, Davies, shake hands,\u201d Ma dam Hooch said briskly, and \nWood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain. \n\u201cMount your brooms . . . on my whistle . . . three \u2014 two \u2014 \none \u2014\u201d \nHarry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher \nand faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium \nand began squinting around for th e Snitch, listening all the while \nto the commentary, which was be ing provided by the Weasley \ntwins\u2019 friend Lee Jordan. \n\u201cThey\u2019re off, and the big excitem ent this match is the Firebolt \nthat Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor.

Averting his eyes from this unpleasant \nsight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible \nyellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid\u2019s wardrobe \ndoor. \n\u201cWhat are they for, Hagrid?\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cBuckbeak\u2019s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o\u2019 Dan-\ngerous Creatures,\u201d said Hagrid. \u201cThis Friday. Him an\u2019 me\u2019ll be \ngoin\u2019 down ter London together. I\u2019ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. . . .\u201d \nHarry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten \nthat Buckbeak\u2019s trial was so near , and judging by the uneasy look \non Ron\u2019s face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise \nabout helping him prepare Buckbeak \u2019s defense; the arrival of the \nFirebolt had driven it cl ean out of their minds. \nHagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, \nbut they knew better than to ac cept; they had had too much expe-\nrience with Hagrid\u2019s cooking. \n\u201cI got somethin\u2019 ter discuss with you two,\u201d said Hagrid, sitting \nhimself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cHermione,\u201d said Hagrid. \n\u201cWhat about her?\u201d said Ron. \n\u201cShe\u2019s in a righ\u2019 state, that\u2019s wh at. She\u2019s bin comin\u2019 down ter visit \nme a lot since Chris\u2019mas. Bin feelin\u2019 lonely. Firs\u2019 yeh weren\u2019 talking"

Parvati whispered somethin g to Lavender, and they both \nglared at Hermione to o. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying \nHermione with unmi stakable anger. \n\u201cI am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this \nclass, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the \nnoble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don\u2019t remember ever \nmeeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.\u201d \nThere was a moment\u2019s silence. Then \u2014 \n\u201cFine!\u201d said Hermio ne suddenly, getting up and cramming Un-\nfogging the Future back into her bag. \u201cFine!\u201d she repeated, swinging \nthe bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. \u201cI give up! I\u2019m leaving!\u201d \n \nTHE QUIDDITCH FINAL \n\u0091 299 \u0091 And to the whole class\u2019s amazemen t, Hermione strode over to \nthe trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of \nsight. \nIt took a few minutes for the clas s to settle down again. Profes-\nsor Trelawney seemed to have fo rgotten all about the Grim. She \nturned abruptly from Harry and Ron\u2019s table, breathing rather heav-\nily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her. \n\u201cOoooo!\u201d said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. \n\u201cOooooo, Professor Trelawney, I\u2019ve just remembered! You saw her \nleaving, didn\u2019t you? Didn\u2019t you, Professor? \u2018 Around Easter, one of our \nnumber will leave us forever !\u2019 You said it ages ago, Professor!\u201d \nProfessor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile. \n\u201cYes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be \nleaving us. One hopes, however, that one might ha ve mistaken the \nSigns. . . . The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know. . . .\u201d \nLavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over \nso that Professor Trelawney co uld join their table instead. \n\u201cSome day Hermione\u2019s having, eh?\u201d Ron muttered to Harry, \nlooking awed. \n\u201cYeah . . .\u201d \nHarry glanced into the crystal ba ll but saw nothing but swirling \nwhite mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? \nWould he? The last thing he need ed was another ne ar-fatal acci-\ndent, with the Qu idditch final drawing ever nearer. \n \nThe Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had \nnever had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn\u2019t the only one."

Even without Div-\nination, she was taking more subj ects than anybody else. She was \nusually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the \nlibrary the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin\u2019s under her \neyes, and seemed constantly close to tears. \nRon had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak\u2019s appeal. When \nhe wasn\u2019t doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psy-\nchology and Fowl or Foul ? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so \nabsorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks. \nHarry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quid-\nditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tac-tics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Ea ster holidays. Slytherin was lead-\ning the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as \nWood constantly reminded his team ) that they needed to win the \nmatch by more than th at amount to win the Cup. It also meant \nthat the burden of winning fell la rgely on Harry, because capturing \nthe Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. \n\u201cSo you must catch it only if we\u2019re more than fifty points up,\u201d \nWood told Harry constantly. \u201cOnly if we\u2019re more than fifty points \nup, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You\u2019ve got that, \nhaven\u2019t you? You must catch the Snitch only if we\u2019re \u2014\u201d \n\u201cI KNOW, OLIVER!\u201d Harry yelled. \nThe whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming \n \nTHE QUIDDITCH FINAL \n\u0091 301 \u0091 match. Gryffindor hadn\u2019t won the Quidditch Cup since the leg-\nendary Charlie Weasley (Ron\u2019s seco nd oldest brother) had been \nSeeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, \nwanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and \nMalfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even \nmore furious that Harry had so mehow wormed his way out of \npunishment. Harry hadn\u2019t forgotten Malfoy\u2019s attempt to sabotage \nhim in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buck-\nbeak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. \nNever, in anyone\u2019s memory, had a match approached in such a \nhighly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, \ntension between the tw o teams and their Hous es was at the break-\ning point. A number of small scu ffles broke out in the corridors, \nculminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year \nand a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks \nsprouting out of their ears. \nHarry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn\u2019t walk \nto class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip \nhim up; Crabbe and Goyle kept po pping up wherever he went, and \nslouching away looking disappo inted when they saw him sur-\nrounded by people. Wood had gi ven instructions that Harry \nshould be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins \ntried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House \ntook up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for \nHarry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerne d for his Firebolt\u2019s"

He was flying at \nTHE QUIDDITCH FINAL \n\u0091 303 \u0091 breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy\u2019s \nsteed\u2019s mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt. He \nfell through the air and woke with a start. \nIt was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match \nhadn\u2019t taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the \nSlytherin team definitely wouldn\u2019t be allowed to play on dragons. \nHe was feeling very thir sty.

No breath of wind disturbed \nthe treetops in the Forbidden Fo rest; the Whomping Willow was \nmotionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the condi-\ntions for the match would be perfect. \nHarry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed \nwhen something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across th e silvery lawn. \nHarry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and \nput them on, then hurried back to the window.

It was \nonly Crookshanks. . . . \nOr was it only Crookshanks? Harry sq uinted, pressing his nose \nflat against the glass.

Even \nFred and George Weasley had been spotted working; they were \nabout to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy \nwas getting ready to take his N.

As Percy \n H \nPROFESSOR TRELAWNEY\u2019S PREDICTION \n\u0091 315 \u0091 hoped to enter the Mini stry of Magic, he needed top grades. He \nwas becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments \nto anybody who disturbed the quie t of the common room in the \nevenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than \nPercy was Hermione. \nHarry and Ron had give n up asking her how she was managing \nto attend several classe s at once, but they co uldn\u2019t restrain them-\nselves when they saw the exam sc hedule she had drawn up for her-\nself.

The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his \nface, it looked like a skull. His ye llow teeth were bared in a grin. It \nwas Sirius Black. \n\u201cExpelliarmus !\u201d he croaked, pointing Ron\u2019s wand at them. \nHarry\u2019s and Hermione\u2019s wands shot out of their hands, high in \nthe air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes \nwere fixed on Harry. \n\u201cI thought you\u2019d come and help your friend,\u201d he said hoarsely. \nHis voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of us-\ning it. \u201cYour father wo uld have done the same for me. Brave of you, \nnot to run for a te acher. I\u2019m grateful . . . it will make everything \nmuch easier. . . .\u201d \nThe taunt about his father rang in Harry\u2019s ears as though Black \nhad bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry\u2019s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back \nin his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack . . . to kill. With-\nout knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but there was \na sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands \ngrabbed him and held him back. . . . \u201cNo, Harr y!\u201d Hermione \ngasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black. \n\u201cIf you want to kill Harry, you\u2019ll have to kill us too!\u201d he said \nfiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of \nstill more color, and he sway ed slightly as he spoke. \nSomething flickered in Black\u2019s shadowed eyes. \n\u201cLie down,\u201d he said quietly to Ro n. \u201cYou will damage that leg \neven more.\u201d \n\u201cDid you hear me?\u201d Ron said weakly, though he was clinging \npainfully to Harry to stay upright. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to kill all three of us!\u201d"

His thin chest rose \nand fell rapidly as he watched Ha rry walking slowly nearer, his \nwand pointing straight at Black\u2019s heart. \n\u201cGoing to kill me, Harry?\u201d he whispered.

Scabbers can\u2019t be Pettigrew . . . it just \ncan\u2019t be true, you kn ow it can\u2019t . . .\u201d \n\u201cWhy can\u2019t it be true?\u201d Lupin said calmly, as though they were in \nclass, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experi-\nment with grindylows. \n\u201cBecause . . . because people would know if Peter Pettigrew \nhad been an Animagus. We did An imagi in class with Professor \nMcGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework \u2014 \nthe Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can \nbecome animals; there\u2019s a register showing what animal they be-\ncome, and their markings and thin gs . . . and I went and looked \nProfessor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew\u2019s name wasn\u2019t on the \nlist \u2014\u201d \nHarry had barely had time to ma rvel inwardly at the effort \nHermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh."

The screams and \nhowls the villagers used to hear were made by me.\u201d \nHe pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a mo-\nment, then said, \u201cThat\u2019s where all of this starts \u2014 with my becom-\ning a werewolf.

My parents \ntried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been maki ng for me is a very recent dis-\ncovery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week \n \nMOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS \n\u0091 353 \u0091 preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. . . . I \nam able to curl up in my office , a harmless wolf, and wait for the \nmoon to wane again. \n\u201cBefore the Wolfsbane Potion wa s discovered, however, I be-\ncame a fully fledged monster once a month. It seem ed impossible \nthat I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren\u2019t \nlikely to want their children exposed to me. \n\u201cBut then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympa-\nthetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there \nwas no reason I shouldn\u2019t come to school. . . .\u201d Lupin sighed, and \nlooked directly at Harry. \u201cI told you, months ago, that the Whomp-\ning Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I c a m e t o H o g w a r t s .

O n c e a m o n t h , I w a s \nsmuggled out of the castle, into th is place, to transform. The tree \nwas placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me \nwhile I was dangerous.\u201d \nHarry couldn\u2019t see where this stor y was going, but he was listen-\ning raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin\u2019s voice \nwas Scabbers\u2019s frightened squeaking. \n\u201cMy transformations in those days were \u2014 were terrible. It is \nvery painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing partic-\nularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . . Even \nnow, when the house has been sil ent for years, the villagers don\u2019t \ndare approach it. . . ."

For the first time ever , I had friends, three \ngreat friends. Sirius Black . . . Peter Pettigrew . . . and, of course, \nyour father, Harr y \u2014 James Potter. \n\u201cNow, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disap-\npeared once a month.

Instead, they did something for \nme that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.\u201d \n\u201cMy dad too?\u201d said Harry, astounded. \u201cYes, indeed,\u201d said Lupin. \u201cIt took them the best part of three \nyears to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the \ncleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the \nAnimagus transformation can go horribly wrong \u2014 one reason the \nMinistry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter \nneeded all the help he could get from James an d Sirius. Finally, in \nour fifth year, they managed it.

Sirius and James transformed into \nsuch large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. \nI doubt whether any Hogwarts stud ents ever found out more about \nthe Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. . . . And that\u2019s \nhow we came to write the Marauder \u2019 s M a p , a n d s i g n i t w i t h o u r \nnicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Pete r is Wormtail.

What if you\u2019d given the others the slip, and bitten \nsomebody?\u201d \n\u201cA thought that still haunts me,\u201d said Lupin heavily. \u201cAnd there \nw e r e n e a r m i s s e s , m a n y o f t h e m .

And I haven\u2019t \nchanged . . . \nLupin\u2019s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. \n\u201cAll this year, I have been battli ng with myself, wondering whether \nI should tell Dumbledore that Siri us was an Animag us. But I didn\u2019t \ndo it. Why? Because I was too co wardly. It would have meant \nadmitting that I\u2019d betr ayed his trust while I was at school, admit-\nting that I\u2019d led others along wi th me . . . and Dumbledore\u2019s trust \nhas meant everything to me.

He \nespecially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James\u2019s talent on the \nQuidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me crossing the \ngrounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward \nthe Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be \u2014 \ner \u2014 amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, an d he\u2019d be able to get in after me. \nWell, of course, Snape tried it \u2014 if he \u2019d got as far as this house, he\u2019d \nhave met a fully grown werewolf \u2014 but your father, who\u2019d heard what Sirius had done, went afte r Snape and pulled him back, at \ngreat risk to his life . . . Snape gl impsed me, though, at the end of \nthe tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but \nfrom that time on he knew what I was. . . .\u201d \n\u201cSo that\u2019s why Snape doesn\u2019t li ke you,\u201d said Harry slowly, \u201cbe-\ncause he thought you we re in on the joke?\u201d \n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d sneered a cold vo ice from the wall behind Lupin. \nSeverus Snape was pulling off the Invisibility Cloak, his wand \npointing directly at Lupin. \nC H A P T E R N I N E T E E N \n \n\u0091 358 \u0091 THE SER V ANT OF LORD VOLDEMOR T \n \n \nermione screamed.

You \nforgot to take your potion tonight, so I took a gobletful along. And \nvery lucky I did . . . lucky for me, I mean. Lying on your desk was \na certain map.

He was quite convinced you were harmless, you \nknow, Lupin . . . a tame werewolf \u2014\u201d \n\u201cYou fool,\u201d said Lupin softly . \u201cIs a schoolboy grudge worth \nputting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?\u201d \nBANG! Thin, snakelike cords bu rst from the en d of Snape\u2019s \nwand and twisted themselves around Lupin\u2019s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With \na roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black\u2019s eyes. \n\u201cGive me a reason,\u201d he whispered. \u201cGive me a reason to do it, \nand I swear I will.\u201d \nBlack stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which \nface showed more hatred. \nHarry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom \nto believe. He glance d around at Ron and Hermione.

Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward \nSnape and said, in a very breathle ss voice, \u201cProfessor Snape \u2014 it \u2014 \nit wouldn\u2019t hurt to hear what they\u2019ve got to say, w \u2014 would it?\u201d \n\u201cMiss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this \nschool,\u201d Snape spat. \u201cYou, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds,"

You agree, Harry?\u201d \nHarry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded \nso that Pettigrew could see him. \n\u201cRight,\u201d said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. \u201cRon, I can\u2019t mend \nbones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it\u2019 s best if \nwe just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital \nwing.\u201d \nHe hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron\u2019s leg with \nhis wand, and muttered, \u201c Ferula. \u201d Bandages spun up Ron\u2019s leg, \n \nTHE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT \n\u0091 377 \u0091 strapping it tightly to a splint.

He hung a few inches ab ove the ground, his limp feet \ndangling.

Ron\u2019s face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers\u2019s \ntrue identity as a personal insult.

Next \ncame Professor Snape, drifting cree pily along, his toes hitting each \nstair as they descende d, held up by his own wand, which was being \npointed at him by Sirius. Harry an d Hermione brought up the rear. \nGetting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and \nRon had to turn sideways to mana ge it; Lupin still had Pettigrew \ncovered with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file. Cr ookshanks was sti ll in the lead. \nHarry went right after Black, wh o was still making Snape drift \nalong ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to \nprevent this. \n\u201cYou know what this means?\u201d Black said abruptly to Harry as they \nmade their slow progress along the tunnel. \u201cTurning Pettigrew in?\u201d H \nTHE DEMENTOR\u2019S KISS \n\u0091 379 \u0091 \u201cYou\u2019re free,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cYes . . . ,\u201d said Black. \u201cBut I\u2019 m also \u2014 I don \u2019 t know if anyone \never told you \u2014 I\u2019m your godfather.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, I knew that,\u201d said Harry. \u201cWell . . . your parents appointed me your guardian,\u201d said Black \nstiffly. \u201cIf anything happened to them . . .\u201d \nHarry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant? \n\u201cI\u2019ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and \nuncle,\u201d said Black. \u201cB ut . . . well . . . thin k about it.

He, Ron, and Hermione had gone . . . but the Harry and \nHermione hidden in the trees coul d now hear what was happening \ninside the cabin through the back door. \n\u201cWhere is the beast?\u201d came the cold voice of Macnair. \u201cOut \u2014 outside,\u201d Hagrid croaked. \nHarry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair\u2019s face appeared at \nHagrid\u2019s window, staring out at Bu ckbeak. Then they heard Fudge. \n\u201cWe \u2014 er \u2014 have to read you the official notice of execution, \nHagrid. I\u2019ll make it quick. And th en you and Macnair need to sign \nit.

The \nhippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still \nten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid\u2019s back door. \n\u201cOne moment, please, Macnair,\u201d came Dumbledore\u2019s voice. \n\u201cYou need to sign too.\u201d The foot steps stopped. Harry heaved on \nthe rope. Buckbeak snapped his be ak and walked a little faster. \nHermione\u2019s white face was stic king out from behind a tree. \n\u201cHarry, hurry!\u201d she mouthed. Harry could still hear Dumbledore\u2019s voice talking from within \nthe cabin. He gave the rope anot her wrench. Buckbeak broke into \na grudging trot. They had reached the trees. . . . \n\u201cQuick! Quick!\u201d Hermione moaned, darting out from behind \nher tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buck-\nbeak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn\u2019t see Hagrid\u2019s garden at all. \n\u201cStop!\u201d he whispered to Hermione. \u201cThey might hear us \u2014\u201d"

He didn\u2019t look surprised to see \nHarry there. \n\u201cYour carriage is at the gates, Remus,\u201d he said. \n\u201cThank you, Headmaster.\u201d \nLupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank. \n\u201cWell \u2014 good-bye, Harry,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cIt has been a \nreal pleasure teaching you.

Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift \nsmile, Lupin le ft the office. \nHarry sat down in his vacated chai r, staring glumly at the floor. \nHe heard the door close and looked up.

A team of doctors \nhad examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Rid-\ndles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangled, suffocated, or (as \nfar as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, \nin a tone of unmistakable bewild erment), the Riddles all appeared \nto be in perfect health \u2014 apart fr om the fact that they were all \ndead. The doctors did note (as th ough determined to find some-\nthing wrong with the bodies) that ea ch of the Riddles had a look of \nterror upon his or her face \u2014 but as the frustrated police said, \nwhoever heard of three people being frightened to death? \nAs there was no proof that the Ri ddles had been murdered at all, \nthe police were forced to let Fran k go. The Riddles were buried in \nthe Little Hangleton churchyard, an d their graves remained objects \nof curiosity for a while. To everyone\u2019s surprise, and amid a cloud of suspicion, Frank Bryce returned to his cottage on the grounds of the \nRiddle House. \n\u201c \u2019S far as I\u2019m concerned, he killed them, and I don\u2019t care what \nthe police say,\u201d said Dot in the Hanged Man. \u201cAnd if he had any \ndecency, he\u2019d leave here, knowing as how we knows he did it.\u201d \nBut Frank did not leave. He stayed to tend the garden for the \nnext family who lived in the Ridd le House, and then the next \u2014 \nfor neither family stayed long. Pe rhaps it was partly because of \nFrank that the new owne rs said there was a na sty feeling about the \nplace, which, in the absence of in habitants, started to fall into \ndisrepair. \n \nThe wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither \nlived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept \nit for \u201ctax reasons,\u201d though nobody was very clear what these might \nTHE RIDDLE HOUSE \n\u0091 5 \u0091 be. The wealthy owner continued to pay Frank to do the garden-\ning, however. Frank was nearing hi s seventy-seventh birthday now, \nvery deaf, his bad leg stiffer than ever, but could be seen pottering \naround the flower beds in fine we ather, even though the weeds were \nstarting to creep up on him, try as he might to suppress them. \nWeeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with ei-\nther. Boys from the village made a h a b i t o f t h r o w i n g s t o n e s \nthrough the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles \nover the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or \ntwice, they broke into the old hous e for a dare. They knew that old \nFrank\u2019s devotion to the house and grounds amounted almost to an \nobsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the gar-\nden, brandishing his stick and yell ing croakily at them. Frank, for \nhis part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, thought him a murderer. So when Frank \nawoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step fur-\nther in their attempts to punish him. \nIt was Frank\u2019s bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse \nthan ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the \nkitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-wa ter bottle to ease the \nstiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he \nlooked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its up-\nper windows. Frank knew at once what was going on. The boys \nhad broken into the house again, and judging by the flickering \nquality of the light, th ey had started a fire. \nFrank had no telephone, and in any case, he had deeply mis-\ntrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning \nabout the Riddles\u2019 deaths. He pu t down the kettle at once, hurried"

He picked up his walking stick, which was \npropped against the wall, and set off into the night. \nThe front door of the Riddle Ho use bore no sign of being \nforced, nor did any of the window s. Frank limped around to the \nback of the house unti l he reached a door al most completely hid-\nden by ivy, took out th e old key, put it into the lock, and opened \nthe door noiselessly. \nHe let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not en-\ntered it for many years; nevertheles s, although it was very dark, he \nremembered where the door into th e hall was, and he groped his \nway toward it, his nostrils full of th e smell of decay, ears pricked for \nany sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the \nhall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned win-\ndows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the \nstairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it \nmuffled the sound of his feet and stick. \nOn the landing, Frank turned right, and saw at once where the \nintruders were: At the very end of the passage a door stood ajar, and \na flickering light shon e through the gap, cast ing a long sliver of \ngold across the black floor. Frank ed ged closer and closer, grasping \nhis walking stick firmly. Several feet from the entrance, he was able to see a narrow slice of the room beyond. \nThe fire, he now saw, had been li t in the grate. This surprised \nhim. Then he stopped moving an d listened intently, for a man\u2019s \nvoice spoke within the room; it sounded timid and fearful. \n\u201cThere is a little more in the bottle, My Lord, if you are still \nhungry.\u201d \nTHE RIDDLE HOUSE \n\u0091 7 \u0091 \u201cLater,\u201d said a second voice. This too belonged to a man \u2014 but \nit was strangely high-pitched, an d cold as a sudden blast of icy \nwind. Something about that voice made the sparse hairs on the \nback of Frank\u2019s neck stand up. \u201cMove me closer to the fire, \nWormtail.\u201d \nFrank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. \nThere came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard \nsurface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being \ndragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his \nback to the door, pushin g the chair into plac e. He was wearing a \nlong black cloak, and there was a ba ld patch at the back of his head. \nThen he went out of sight again. \n\u201cWhere is Nagini?\u201d sa id the cold voice. \n\u201cI \u2014 I don\u2019t know, My Lord,\u201d said the first voice nervously. \u201cShe \nset out to explore the house, I think. . . .\u201d \n\u201cYou will milk her before we reti re, Wormtail,\u201d said the second \nvoice. \u201cI will need feed ing in the night. The journey has tired me \ngreatly.\u201d \nBrow furrowed, Frank inclined his good ear still closer to the \ndoor, listening very hard. There was a pause, and then the man \ncalled Wormtail spoke again. \n\u201cMy Lord, may I ask how long we are going to stay here?\u201d \n\u201cA week,\u201d said the cold voice. \u201cPerhaps longer. The place is mod-\nerately comfortable, and the plan cannot proceed yet. It would be \nfoolish to act before the Qu idditch World Cup is over.\u201d \nFrank inserted a gnarled finger into his ear and rotated it. Ow-\ning, no doubt, to a buildup of earwax, he had heard the word \n\u201cQuidditch,\u201d which was not a word at all. \n\u201cThe \u2014 the Quidditch World Cup, My Lord?\u201d said Wormtail."

He had distinctly heard \nthe words \u201cMinistry of Magic,\u201d \u201cwizards,\u201d and \u201cMuggles.\u201d Plainly, each of these expressions meant something secret, and Frank could \nthink of only two sorts of people who would speak in code: spies \nand criminals.

The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug. \nAnd then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sit-\nting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He \nopened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so \nloudly that he never he ard the words the thing in the chair spoke as \nit raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, \nand Frank Bryce crumpled.

He \nput them on and his bedroom came in to clearer focus, lit by a faint, \nmisty orange light that was filtering through the curtains from the street lamp outside the window. \nHarry ran his fingers over the scar again. It was still painful. He \nturned on the lamp be side him, scrambled ou t of bed, crossed the \nroom, opened his wardrobe, and peer ed into the mirror on the in-\nside of the door.

He examined \n H \nTHE SCAR \n\u0091 17 \u0091 the lightning-bolt scar of his reflection more closely.

Then he snapped the book shut. Even \nQuidditch \u2014 in Harry\u2019s opinion, the best sport in the world \u2014 \ncouldn\u2019t distract him at the moment. He placed Flying with the \nCannons on his bedside table, cro ssed to the window, and drew \nback the curtains to su rvey the street below. \nPrivet Drive looked exactly as a respectable suburban street \nwould be expected to l ook in the early hours of Saturday morning. \nAll the curtains were closed. As far as Harry could see through the \ndarkness, there wasn\u2019t a living creature in sight, not even a cat. \nAnd yet . . . and yet . . . Harry went restless ly back to the bed \nand sat down on it, running a finger over his scar ag ain. It wasn\u2019t \nthe pain that bothered him; Harry was no stranger to pain and in-\njury. He had lost all the bones from his right arm once and had \nthem painfully regrown in a night. The same arm had been pierced \nby a venomous foot-long fang not long afterward. Only last year \nHarry had fallen fifty feet from an airborne broomstick. He was \nused to bizarre accident s and injuries; they were unavoidable if you \nTHE SCAR \n\u0091 19 \u0091 attended Hogwarts School of Wi tchcraft and Wi zardry and had a \nknack for attracting a lot of trouble. \nNo, the thing that was bothering Harry was that the last time his \nscar had hurt him, it had been because Voldemort had been close \nby. . . . But Voldemort couldn\u2019t be here, now. . . . The idea of \nVoldemort lurking in Privet Drive was absu rd, impossible. . . . \nHarry listened closely to the si lence around him. Was he half-\nexpecting to hear the creak of a st air or the swish of a cloak? And \nthen he jumped slightly as he heard his cousin Dudley give a \ntremendous grunting snor e from the next room. \nHarry shook himself mentally; he was being stupid. There was \nno one in the house with him exce pt Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petunia, \nand Dudley, and they were plainl y still asleep, their dreams un-\ntroubled and painless. \nAsleep was the way Har ry liked the Dursleys best; it wasn\u2019t as \nthough they were ever any help to him awake. Uncle Vernon, Aunt \nPetunia, and Dudley were Harry\u2019s only living relatives. They were Muggles who hated and despised magic in any form, which meant \nthat Harry was about as welcome in their house as dry rot. They \nhad explained away Harry\u2019s long absences at Hogwarts over the last \nthree years by telling everyone that he went to St. Brutus\u2019s Secure \nCenter for Incurably Criminal Boys. They knew perfectly well \nthat, as an underage wizard, Harr y wasn\u2019t allowed to use magic out-\nside Hogwarts, but they were still apt to blame him for anything \nthat went wrong about the house. Harry had never been able to \nconfide in them or tell them anything about hi s life in the wizard-\ning world. The very idea of going to them when they awoke, and \ntelling them about his scar hurt ing him, and about his worries \nabout Voldemort, was laughable."

If it hadn\u2019t been for Voldemort, \nHarry would not have had the lightnin g scar on his forehead. If it \nhadn\u2019t been for Voldemort, Harry wo uld still have ha d parents. . . . \nHarry had been a year old the ni ght that Voldemort \u2014 the most \npowerful Dark wizard for a centu ry, a wizard who had been gain-\ning power steadily for eleven ye ars \u2014 arrived at his house and \nkilled his father and mother. Voldemort had then turned his wand \non Harry; he had perf ormed the curse that ha d disposed of many \nfull-grown witches and wizards in his steady rise to power \u2014 and, \nincredibly, it had not worked. Instead of killing th e small boy, the \ncurse had rebounded upon Voldem ort. Harry had survived with \nnothing but a lightning-shaped cut on his forehead, and Volde-\nmort had been reduced to something barely alive. His powers gone, \nhis life almost extinguished, Vold emort had fled; the terror in \nwhich the secret community of witches and wizards had lived for \nso long had lifted, Voldemort\u2019s fo llowers had disbanded, and Harry \nPotter had become famous. \nIt had been enough of a shock for Harry to discover, on his \neleventh birthday, that he was a wizard; it had been even more dis-\nconcerting to find out that everyone in the hidden wizarding world \nknew his name. Harry had arrived at Hogwarts to find that heads \nturned and whispers followed him wherever he went. But he was used to it now: At the end of this summer, he would be starting his fourth year at Hogwarts, and Har ry was already counting the days \nuntil he would be back at the castle again. \nBut there was still a fortnight to g o b e f o r e h e w e n t b a c k t o \nschool. He looked hopelessly around his room again, and his eye \n \nTHE SCAR \n\u0091 21 \u0091 paused on the birthday cards his two best friends had sent him at \nthe end of July. What would they say if Harry wrote to them and \ntold them about his scar hurting? \nAt once, Hermione Granger\u2019s voice seemed to fill his head, shrill \nand panicky. \n\u201cYour scar hurt ? Harry, that\u2019s really serious. . . . Write to Professor \nDumbledore ! And I\u2019ll go and check Common Magical Ailments and \nAfflictions. . . . Maybe there\u2019s something in there about curse scars. . . .\u201d \nYes, that would be Hermione\u2019s advice: Go straight to the head-\nmaster of Hogwarts, and in the meantime, consult a book. Harry \nstared out of the window at the i n k y b l u e - b l a c k s k y . H e d o u b t e d \nvery much whether a book could help him now. As far as he knew, \nhe was the only living person to have survived a curse like Volde-\nmort\u2019s; it was highly unlikely, th erefore, that he would find his \nsymptoms listed in Common Magical Ailments and Afflictions. As \nfor informing the headmaster, Harry had no idea where Dumble-\ndore went during the summer holi days. He amused himself for a \nmoment, picturing Dumbledore, with his long silver beard, full-\nlength wizard\u2019s robes, and pointe d hat, stretched out on a beach \nsomewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto his long crooked nose. \nWherever Dumbledore was, though , Harry was sure that Hedwig \nwould be able to find him; Harry\u2019 s owl had never yet failed to de-\nliver a letter to anyone, even without an address. But what would \nhe write? \nDear Professor Dumbledore, Sorry to bother you, but my scar hurt \nthis morning. Yours sincerely, Harry Potter. \nEven inside his head th e words sounded stupid. \nAnd so he tried to imagine his ot her best friend, Ron Weasley\u2019s,"

Mrs. Weasley would fuss worse than \nHermione, and Fred an d George, Ron\u2019s sixt een-year-old twin \nbrothers, might think Harry was lo sing his nerve. The Weasleys \nwere Harry\u2019s favorite family in th e world; he was hoping that they \nmight invite him to stay any ti me now (Ron had mentioned some-\nthing about the Quiddi tch World Cup), and he somehow didn\u2019t \nwant his visit punctuated with anxious inquiries about his scar. \nHarry kneaded his forehead with his knuckles. What he really \nwanted (and it felt al most shameful to admit it to himself) was \nsomeone like \u2014 someone like a parent : an adult wizard whose ad-\nvice he could ask without feeling stupid, someone who cared about \nhim, who had had experience with Dark Magic. . . . \nAnd then the solution came to him.

But then, \nperhaps it wasn\u2019t so surprising \u2014 after all, he had only found out \nthat Sirius was his godf ather two months ago. \nThere was a simple reason for Si rius\u2019s complete absence from \nHarry\u2019s life until then \u2014 Sirius ha d been in Azkaban, the terrifying \nwizard jail guarded by creatures ca lled dementors, sightless, soul-\nsucking fiends who had come to search for Sirius at Hogwarts \nwhen he had escaped. Yet Sirius had been innocent \u2014 the murders \nfor which he had been convicte d had been committed by Worm-\ntail, Voldemort\u2019s suppor ter, whom nearly everybody now believed \ndead. Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew otherwise, however; they \nhad come face-to-face with Worm tail only the previous year, \nthough only Professo r Dumbledore had beli eved their story. \nFor one glorious hour, Harry had believed that he was leaving \nthe Dursleys at last, because Sirius had offered him a home once his \nname had been cleared. But the chance had been snatched away \nfrom him \u2014 Wormtail had escaped before they could take him to \nthe Ministry of Magic, and Sirius had had to flee for his life. Harry \nhad helped him escape on the back of a hippogriff called Buckbeak, \nand since then, Sirius had been on the run. The home Harry might \nhave had if Wormtail had not escaped had been haunting him all \nsummer. It had been dou bly hard to return to the Dursleys know-\ning that he had so nearly escaped them forever. \nNevertheless, Sirius had been of so me help to Harry, even if he \ncouldn\u2019t be with him. It was due to Sirius that Harry now had all \nhis school things in his bedroom with him.

But their attitude had changed since they \nhad found out that Harry had a dangerous murderer for a god-\nfather \u2014 for Harry had conveniently forgotten to tell them that \nSirius was innocent. \nHarry had received two letters fr om Sirius since he had been \nback at Privet Drive. Both had been delivered, not by owls (as was \nusual with wizards), but by large, brightly colored tropical birds. \nHedwig had not approved of these flashy intruders; she had been \nmost reluctant to allow them to drink from her wa ter tray before \nflying off again. Harry, on the ot her hand, had liked them; they put \nhim in mind of palm trees and white sand, and he hoped that, \nwherever Sirius was (Sirius never sa id, in case the letters were inter-\ncepted), he was enjoying himself. Somehow, Harry found it hard to \nimagine dementors surviving for lo ng in bright sunlight; perhaps \nthat was why Sirius had gone south. Sirius\u2019s letters, which were now hidden beneath the highly useful loose floorboard under Harry\u2019s bed, sounded cheerful, and in bo th of them he had reminded \nHarry to call on him if ever Harr y needed to. Well, he needed to \nnow, all right. . . . \nHarry\u2019s lamp seemed to grow dimmer as the cold gray light that \nprecedes sunrise slowly crept into the room. Finally, when the sun had risen, when his bedroom wa lls had turned gold, and when \nsounds of movement could be he ard from Uncle Vernon and Aunt \nPetunia\u2019s room, Harry cleared his desk of crumpled pieces of parch-\nment and reread his finished letter. \n \nDear Sirius, \nThanks for your last lett er. That bird was enormous ; it \ncould hardly get through my window. \nTHE SCAR \n\u0091 25 \u0091 \nThings are the same as usual he re. Dudley\u2019s diet isn\u2019t going \ntoo well. My aunt found him smuggling doughnuts into his \nroom yesterday. They told him they\u2019d have to cut his pocket \nmoney if he keeps doing it, so he got really angry and chucked his PlayStation out of the window . That\u2019s a sort of computer \nthing you can play games on. Bit stupid really, now he hasn\u2019t \neven got Mega-Mutilation Part Three to take his mind off \nthings. \nI\u2019m okay, mainly because the Dursleys are terrified you \nmight turn up and turn them all into bats if I ask you to. \nA weird thing happened this morning, though. My scar \nhurt again. Last time that ha ppened it was because Voldemort \nwas at Hogwarts. But I don\u2019t reck on he can be anywhere near \nme now, can he ? Do you know if curse scars sometimes hurt \nyears afterward ? \nI\u2019ll send this with Hedwig when she gets back ; she\u2019s off hunt-\ning at the moment. Say he llo to Buckbeak for me. \n \n \n \nYes, thought Harry, that looked all right. There was no point \nputting in the dream; he didn\u2019t want it to look as though he was too \nworried. He folded up the parchment and laid it aside on his desk, \nready for when Hedwig returned. Then he got to his feet, stretched, \nand opened his wardrobe once more. Without glancing at his re-\nflection, he started to get dressed before going down to breakfast. \nC H A P T E R T H R E E \n \n\u0091 26 \u0091 THE INVITATION \n \n \n \ny the time Harry arrived in th e kitchen, the three Dursleys \nwere already seated around the ta ble. None of them looked up \nas he entered or sat down. Uncle Vernon\u2019s large red face was hidden \nbehind the morning\u2019s Daily Mail, and Aunt Petunia was cutting a \ngrapefruit into quarters, her lips pursed over her horselike teeth. \nDudley looked furious and sulky, and somehow seemed to be \ntaking up even more space than usual. This was saying something, \nas he always took up an entire side of the square table by himself. \nWhen Aunt Petunia put a quarter of unsweetened grapefruit onto \nDudley\u2019s plate with a tremulous \u201cThere you are, Diddy darling,\u201d \nDudley glowered at her. His life had taken a most unpleasant turn since he had come home for th e summer with his end-of-year \nreport. \nUncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had managed to find excuses \nfor his bad marks as us ual: Aunt Petunia alwa ys insisted that Dud-\nley was a very gifted boy whose te achers didn\u2019t understand him, B \nTHE INVITATION \n\u0091 27 \u0091 while Uncle Vernon maintained that \u201che didn\u2019t want some swotty \nlittle nancy boy for a son anyway.\u201d They also skated over the accu-\nsations of bullying in the report \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s a boisterous little boy, but \nhe wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly!\u201d Aunt Petunia had said tearfully. \nHowever, at the bottom of the report there were a few well-\nchosen comments from the school nurse that not even Uncle Ver-\nnon and Aunt Petunia could expl ain away. No matter how much \nAunt Petunia wailed that Dudl ey was big-boned, and that his \npoundage was really puppy fat, and that he was a growing boy who \nneeded plenty of food, the fact rema ined that the school outfitters \ndidn\u2019t stock knickerbockers bi g enough for him anymore. The \nschool nurse had seen what Aunt Pe tunia\u2019s eyes \u2014 so sharp when it \ncame to spotting fingerprints on her gleaming walls, and in ob-\nserving the comings and goings of the neighbors \u2014 simply refused \nto see: that far from needing extra nourishment, Dudley had reached roughly the size and we ight of a young killer whale. \nSo \u2014 after many tantrums, afte r arguments that shook Harry\u2019s \nbedroom floor, and many tears from Aunt Petunia \u2014 the new \nregime had begun. The diet sheet that had been sent by the Smelt-\nings school nurse had been tape d to the fridge, which had been \nemptied of all Dudley\u2019s favorite things \u2014 fizzy drinks and cakes, \nchocolate bars and burgers \u2014 and fi lled instead with fruit and veg-\netables and the sorts of things that Uncle Vernon called \u201crabbit \nfood.\u201d To make Dudley feel better about it all, Aunt Petunia had \ninsisted that the whole family fo llow the diet too. She now passed \na grapefruit quarter to Harry. He no ticed that it was a lot smaller \nthan Dudley\u2019s. Aunt Petunia seemed to feel that the best way to \nkeep up Dudley\u2019s morale was to make sure that he did, at least, get \nmore to eat than Harry."

The moment he had got wind of the fact that he was \nexpected to survive the summer on carrot sticks, Harry had sent \nHedwig to his friends with pleas fo r help, and they had risen to the \noccasion magnificently. Hedwig had returned from Hermione\u2019s \nhouse with a large box stuffed full of sugar-free snacks. (Hermione\u2019s \nparents were dentists.) Hagrid , the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had \nobliged with a sack full of his own homemade rock cakes. (Harry \nhadn\u2019t touched these; he had had too much experience of Hagrid\u2019s \ncooking.) Mrs. Weasley, however, had sent the family owl, Errol, \nwith an enormous fruitcake and assorted meat pies. Poor Errol, who was elderly and feeble, had needed a full five days to recover from \nthe journey. And then on Harry\u2019s bi rthday (which the Dursleys had \ncompletely ignored) he had received four superb birthday cakes, \none each from Ron, Hermione, Ha grid, and Sirius. Harry still had \ntwo of them left, and so, looking fo rward to a real breakfast when he \ngot back upstairs, he ate his grapefruit without complaint. \nUncle Vernon laid aside his pape r with a deep sniff of disap-\nproval and looked down at hi s own grapefruit quarter. \n\u201cIs this it?\u201d he said grumpily to Aunt Petunia. \nAunt Petunia gave him a severe look, and then nodded pointedly \nat Dudley, who had already finished his own grapefruit quarter and was eyeing Harry\u2019s with a very sour look in his piggy little eyes. \nUncle Vernon gave a great sigh, which ruffled his large, bushy \nmustache, and picked up his spoon. \nThe doorbell rang.

Now.\u201d \nBewildered, wondering what on earth he was supposed to have \ndone this time, Harry got up and fo llowed Uncle Vernon out of the \nkitchen and into the next room. Uncle Vernon closed the door \nsharply behind both of them. \n\u201cSo,\u201d he said, marching over to the fireplace and turning to face \nHarry as though he were about to pronounce him under arrest. \u201cSo.\u201d \nHarry would have dearly loved to have said , \u201cSo what?\u201d but he \ndidn\u2019t feel that Uncle Ve rnon\u2019s temper should be tested this early in \nthe morning, especially when it was already under severe strain \nfrom lack of food.

Shaking with anger, he shot a nervous look \nthrough the window, as though expecting to see some of the neigh-\nbors with their ears pressed against the glass. \n\u201cHow many times do I have to te ll you not to mention that un-\nnaturalness under my roof?\u201d he hi ssed, his face now a rich plum \ncolor. \u201cYou stand there, in the clothes Petunia and I have put on \nyour ungrateful back \u2014\u201d \n\u201cOnly after Dudley finished with them,\u201d said Harry coldly, and \nindeed, he was dressed in a sweats hirt so large for him that he had \nhad to roll back the sleeves five ti mes so as to be able to use his \nhands, and which fell past the knees of his extremely baggy jeans. \n\u201cI will not be spoken to like th at!\u201d said Uncle Vernon, trembling \nwith rage. \nBut Harry wasn\u2019t going to stand for this. Gone were the days \nwhen he had been forced to take ev ery single one of the Dursleys\u2019 \nstupid rules. He wasn\u2019t following Dudley\u2019s diet, and he wasn\u2019t going \nto let Uncle Vernon stop him fr om going to the Quidditch World \nCup, not if he could help it. Harry took a d eep, steadying breath \nand then said, \u201cOkay, I can\u2019t se e the World Cup. Can I go now, \nthen? Only I\u2019ve got a letter to Sirius I want to finish. You know \u2014 \nmy godfather.\u201d \nHe had done it. He had said th e magic words. Now he watched \nthe purple recede blotchily from Uncle Vernon\u2019s face, making it \nlook like badly mixed black currant ice cream."

If he told Harry he couldn\u2019t go \nto the Quidditch World Cup, Ha rry would write and tell Sirius, \nwho would know Harry was being mistreat ed. There was only one \nthing for Uncle Vernon to do. Harry could see the conclusion \nforming in his uncle\u2019s mind as though the great mustached face \nwere transparent. Harry tried not to smile, to keep his own face as \nblank as possible. And then \u2014 \n\u201cWell, all right then. Yo u can go to this ruddy . . . this stupid . . . \nthis World Cup thing.

He was going . . . he was \ngoing to the Weasleys\u2019, he was going to watch the Quidditch World Cup! \nOutside in the hall he nearly ran into Dudley, who had been \nlurking behind the door, clearly hoping to overhear Harry being \nTHE INVITATION \n\u0091 35 \u0091 told off. He looked shocked to see the broad grin on Harry\u2019s \nface. \n\u201cThat was an excellent breakfast, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d said Harry. \u201cI feel \nreally full, don\u2019t you?\u201d \nLaughing at the astonished look on Dudley\u2019s face, Harry took \nthe stairs three at a time, and hurled himself back into his \nbedroom. \nThe first thing he saw was that Hedwig was back. She was sitting \nin her cage, staring at Harry wi th her enormous amber eyes, and \nclicking her beak in the way that meant she was annoyed about \nsomething. Exactly what was annoying her became apparent al-most at once. \n\u201cOUCH!\u201d said Harry as what appeared to be a small, gray, \nfeathery tennis ball collided with the side of his head. Harry mas-\nsaged the spot furiously, looking up to see what had hit him, and \nsaw a minute owl, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand, \nwhizzing excitedly around the room like a loose firework. Harry then realized that the owl had dr opped a letter at his feet. Harry \nbent down, recognized Ron\u2019s handwr iting, then tore open the en-\nvelope. Inside was a ha stily scribbled note. \n \nHarry \u2014 DAD GOT THE TICKETS \u2014 Ireland versus \nBulgaria, Monday night. Mum\u2019s writing to the Muggles to ask \nyou to stay.

They\u2019d \nbetter have the decency to put on normal clothes, that\u2019s all.\u201d \nHarry felt a slight sense of foreb oding. He had rarely seen Mr. or \nMrs. Weasley wearing anything that the Dursleys would call \u201cnor-\nmal.\u201d Their children might don Muggle clothing during the holi-\ndays, but Mr. and Mrs. Weasley usually wore long robes in varying states of shabbiness. Harry wasn\u2019t bothered about what the neigh-\nbors would think, but he was anxi ous about how rude the Dursleys \nmight be to the Weasleys if they turned up looking like their worst \nidea of wizards. \nUncle Vernon had put on his best suit. To some people, this \nmight have looked like a gesture of welcome, but Harry knew it was because Uncle Vernon wanted to look impressive and intimi-\ndating. Dudley, on the other hand, looked somehow diminished. This was not because the diet was at last taking effect, but due to \nfright. Dudley had emerged from his last encounter with a fully-\ngrown wizard with a curly pig\u2019s tail poking out of the seat of his \ntrousers, and Aunt Petunia and Uncl e Vernon had had to pay for its \nremoval at a private hospital in London. It wasn\u2019t altogether sur-\nprising, therefore, that Dudley kept running his hand nervously \nover his backside, and walking side ways from room to room, so as \nnot to present the same target to the enemy. \nLunch was an almost silent meal. Dudley didn\u2019t even protest at \nthe food (cottage cheese and grated celery). Aunt Petunia wasn\u2019t \neating anything at all. Her arms were folded, her lips were pursed, \nand she seemed to be chewing her tongue, as though biting back \nthe furious diatribe she lo nged to throw at Harry. \n\u201cThey\u2019ll be driving, of course?\u201d Uncle Vernon barked across the \ntable. \nBACK TO THE BURROW \n\u0091 41 \u0091 \u201cEr,\u201d said Harry. \nHe hadn\u2019t thought of that. How were the Weasleys going to pick \nhim up? They didn\u2019t have a car an ymore; the old Ford Anglia they \nhad once owned was currently running wild in the Forbidden For-est at Hogwarts. But Mr. Weasley had borrowed a Ministry of \nMagic car last year; possibly he would do the same today? \n\u201cI think so,\u201d said Harry. \nUncle Vernon snorted into his mustache. Normally, Uncle Ver-\nnon would have asked what car Mr. Weasley drove; he tended to judge other men by how big and expensive their cars were. But \nHarry doubted whether Uncle Vern on would have taken to Mr. \nWeasley even if he drove a Ferrari. \nHarry spent most of the afternoon in his bedroom; he couldn\u2019t \nstand watching Aunt Petunia peer out through the net curtains every few seconds, as though ther e had been a warning about an es-\ncaped rhinoceros. Finally, at a qu arter to five, Harry went back \ndownstairs and into the living room. \nAunt Petunia was compulsively straightening cushions. Uncle \nVernon was pretending to read the pa per, but his tiny eyes were not \nmoving, and Harry was sure he was really listening with all his \nmight for the sound of an approaching car. Dudley was crammed \ninto an armchair, his porky hand s beneath him, clamped firmly \naround his bottom. Harry couldn\u2019t take the tension; he left the room and went and sat on the stairs in the hall, his eyes on his \nwatch and his heart pumping fast from excitement and nerves. \nBut five o\u2019clock came and then went. Uncle Vernon, perspiring \nslightly in his suit, opened the front door, peered up and down the \nstreet, then withdrew his head quickly. \n\u201cThey\u2019re late!\u201d he snarled at Harry."

Unfortunately, Uncle Ver-non\u2019s bulk, while sufficient to hide bony Aunt Petunia, was \nnowhere near enough to conceal Dudley. \n\u201cAh, this is your cousin, is it , Harry?\u201d said Mr. Weasley, taking \nanother brave stab at making conversation. \n\u201cYep,\u201d said Harry, \u201cthat\u2019s Dudley.\u201d He and Ron exchanged glances and then quickly looked away \nfrom each other; the temptation to burst out laughing was almost overwhelming. Dudley was still clutching his bottom as though afraid it might fall off. Mr. Weas ley, however, seemed genuinely \nconcerned at Dudley\u2019s peculiar behavior. Indeed, from the tone of his voice when he next spoke, Harry was quite sure that Mr. \nWeasley thought Dudley was quite as mad as the Dursleys thought \nhe was, except that Mr. Weasley felt sympathy rather than fear. \nBACK TO THE BURROW \n\u0091 47 \u0091 \u201cHaving a good holiday, Du dley?\u201d he said kindly. \nDudley whimpered.

He had a broad, good-n atured face, which was weather-\nbeaten and so freckly that he l ooked almost tanned; his arms were \nmuscular, and one of them had a large, shiny burn on it. \nBill got to his feet, smiling, and also shook Harry\u2019s hand. Bill \ncame as something of a surprise. Harry knew that he worked for \nthe wizarding bank, Gringotts, and that Bill had been Head Boy at \nHogwarts; Harry had always imagined Bill to be an older version of \nPercy: fussy about rule-breaking and fond of bossing everyone \naround.

The source of the com-\nmotion was revealed as they ente red the garden, and saw that Bill \nand Charlie both had their wands out, and were making two bat-\ntered old tables fly high above the lawn, smashing into each other, \neach attempting to knock the ot her\u2019s out of the air. Fred and \nGeorge were cheering, Ginny was laughing, and Hermione was \nhovering near the hedge, apparently torn between amusement and \nanxiety. \nBill\u2019s table caught Charlie\u2019s wi th a huge bang and knocked one \nof its legs off. There was a cla tter from overhead, and they all \nlooked up to see Percy\u2019s head poking out of a window on the sec-\nond floor. \n\u201cWill you keep it down?!\u201d he bellowed. \n\u201cSorry, Perce,\u201d said Bill, grinning. \u201cHow\u2019re the cauldron bot-\ntoms coming on?\u201d \n\u201cVery badly,\u201d said Percy peevishl y, and he slammed the window \nshut. Chuckling, Bill an d Charlie directed the ta bles safely onto the \ngrass, end to end, and then, with a flick of his wand, Bill reattached \nthe table leg and conjured tablecloths from nowhere. \nBy seven o\u2019clock, the two tables were groaning under dishes and \ndishes of Mrs. Weasley\u2019s excellent cooking, and the nine Weasleys, \nWEASLEYS\u2019 WIZARD WHEEZES \n\u0091 61 \u0091 Harry, and Hermione were settling themselves down to eat beneath \na clear, deep-blue sky. To somebo dy who had been living on meals \nof increasingly stale cake all summer , this was paradise, and at first, \nHarry listened rather than talked as he helped him self to chicken \nand ham pie, boiled potatoes, and salad. \nAt the far end of the table, Perc y was telling his father all about \nhis report on cauldron bottoms. \n\u201cI\u2019ve told Mr. Crouch that I\u2019ll have it ready by Tuesday,\u201d Percy \nwas saying pompously. \u201cThat\u2019s a bit sooner than he expected it, but \nI like to keep on top of things.

Once out of \nearshot of Mr. Roberts, he muttered to Mr. We asley, \u201cBeen having \na lot of trouble with him. Need s a Memory Charm ten times a day \nto keep him happy.

However, here and \nBAGMAN AND CROUCH \n\u0091 79 \u0091 there was a tent so ob viously magical that Harry could hardly be \nsurprised that Mr. Roberts was ge tting suspicious. Halfway up the \nfield stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature \npalace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little \nfarther on they passed a tent th at had three floors and several tur-\nrets; and a short way beyo nd that was a tent that had a front garden \nattached, complete with bird bath, sundial, and fountain. \n\u201cAlways the same,\u201d said Mr. Weasley, smiling. \u201cWe can\u2019t resist \nshowing off when we get together. Ah, here we are, look, this is us.\u201d \nThey had reached the very edge of the wood at the top of the \nfield, and here was an empty space, with a small sign hammered into \nthe ground that read weezly . \n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have a better spot!\u201d said Mr. Weasley happily. \u201cThe \nfield is just on the other side of the wood there, we\u2019re as close as we \ncould be.\u201d He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. \u201cRight,\u201d he \nsaid excitedly, \u201cno magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we\u2019re out in these numbers on Muggle land.

However, he and Hermione \nworked out where most of the poles and pegs should go, and \nthough Mr. Weasley was more of a hindrance than a help, because \nhe got thoroughly overexcited when it came to using the mallet, they finally managed to erect a pair of shabby two-man tents. \nAll of them stood back to admi re their handiwork.

They made \ntheir way slowly through the rows, staring eagerly around. It was \nonly just dawning on Harry how many witches and wizards there must be in the world; he had never really thought much about \nthose in other countries. \nTheir fellow campers were starting to wake up. First to stir were \nthe families with sma ll children; Harry had never seen witches and \nwizards this young before. A tiny boy no older than two was crouched outside a large pyramid- shaped tent, holding a wand and \npoking happily at a slug in the gr ass, which was swelling slowly to \nthe size of a salami. As they drew level with him, his mother came \nhurrying out of the tent. \n\u201cHow many times, Kevin?

The picture was, of \ncourse, moving, but all it did was blink and scowl. \n\u201cKrum,\u201d said Ron quietly. \u201cWhat?\u201d said Hermione. \u201cKrum!\u201d said Ron. \u201cViktor Kr um, the Bulgarian Seeker!\u201d \n\u201cHe looks really grumpy,\u201d said Hermione, looking around at the \nmany Krums blinking and scowling at them. \n\u201c\u2018Really grumpy \u2019?\u201d Ron raised his eyes to the heavens. \u201cWho cares \nwhat he looks like?

Oliver Wood, the old ca ptain of Harry\u2019s House Quidditch \nteam, who had just left Hogwarts, dragged Ha rry over to his par-\nents\u2019 tent to introduce him, and told him excitedly that he had just \nbeen signed to the Puddlemere Un ited reserve team.

He supposed, now that he saw rep-\nresentatives of so many nationalities in the campsite, that he had \nbeen stupid never to realize that Hogwarts couldn \u2019t be the only \none. He glanced at Hermione, wh o looked utterly unsurprised by \nthe information. No doubt she had run across the news about other wizarding schools in some book or other. \n\u201cYou\u2019ve been ages,\u201d said George when they finally got back to \nthe Weasleys\u2019 tents. \n\u201cMet a few people,\u201d said Ron, setting the water down. \u201cYou not \ngot that fire started yet?\u201d \n\u201cDad\u2019s having fun with the matches,\u201d said Fred. \nMr. Weasley was having no success at all in lighting the fire, but \nit wasn\u2019t for lack of trying.

Ludo!\u201d \nLudo Bagman was easily the most noticeable person Harry had \nseen so far, even including old Ar chie in his flow ered nightdress. \nHe was wearing long Quidditch robe s in thick horizontal stripes of \nbright yellow and black. An en ormous picture of a wasp was \nsplashed across his chest. He ha d the look of a powerfully built \nman gone slightly to seed; the robe s were stretched tightly across a \nlarge belly he surely had not had in the days when he had played \nQuidditch for England. His nose was squashed (probably broken by a stray Bludger, Harry thought), but his round blue eyes, short \n \nBAGMAN AND CROUCH \n\u0091 87 \u0091 blond hair, and rosy complexion made him look like a very over-\ngrown schoolboy. \n\u201cAhoy there!\u201d Bagman called happily.

No t much for me to do!\u201d \nBehind him, a group of hagga rd-looking Ministry wizards \nrushed past, pointing at the distant evidence of some sort of a mag-\nical fire that was sending violet sparks twenty feet into the air. \nPercy hurried forward with his hand outstretched.

Barty!\u201d \nA wizard had just Apparated at their fireside, and he could not \nhave made more of a contrast wi th Ludo Bagman, sprawled on the \ngrass in his old Wasp robes. Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, el-\nderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting \nin his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his nar-\nrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a \nslide rule. His shoes were very hi ghly polished.

There were lumi-\nnous rosettes \u2014 green for Ireland, red for Bulgaria \u2014 which were \nsquealing the names of the player s, pointed green hats bedecked \nwith dancing shamrocks, Bulgarian scarves adorned with lions that \nreally roared, flags from both coun tries that played their national \nanthems as they were waved; ther e were tiny models of Firebolts \nthat really flew, and collectible figures of famous players, which \nstrolled across the palm of your hand, preening themselves. \n\u201cBeen saving my pocket money al l summer for this,\u201d Ron told \nHarry as they and Hermione strolle d through the salesmen, buying \nsouvenirs.

At either end of the field stood \nthree goal hoops, fifty feet high; right opposite them, almost at \nHarry\u2019s eye level, was a gigantic blackboard.

Farther still along the \npath, they walked into a patch of silvery li ght, and when they \nlooked through the trees, they sa w three tall and beautiful veela \nstanding in a clearing, surrounded by a gaggle of young wizards, all \nof whom were talking very loudly. \n\u201cI pull down about a hundred sack s of Galleons a year!\u201d one of \nthem shouted. \u201cI\u2019m a dragon killer for the Committee for the Dis-\nposal of Dangerous Creatures.\u201d"

Wheeeeeeeeee!\u201d And \nhe aimed another bomb at a grou p of second years who had just \narrived. \n\u201cI shall call the headmaster!\u201d shouted Professor McGonagall. \n\u201cI\u2019m warning you, Peeves \u2014\u201d \nTHE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT \n\u0091 173 \u0091 Peeves stuck out his tongue, thre w the last of his water bombs \ninto the air, and zoomed off up the marble staircase, cackling \ninsanely. \n\u201cWell, move along, then!\u201d said Professor McGonagall sharply to \nthe bedraggled crow d. \u201cInto the Great Hall, come on!\u201d \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione slippe d and slid across the entrance \nhall and through the double doors on the right, Ron muttering \nfuriously under his brea th as he pushed his sopping hair off his \nface. \nThe Great Hall looked its usual splendid self, decorated for the \nstart-of-term feast. Golden plates and goblets gleamed by the light \nof hundreds and hundreds of candles, floating over the tables in \nmidair. The four long House tables were packed with chattering \nstudents; at the top of the Hall, the staff sat al ong one side of a fifth \ntable, facing their pupils. It was much warmer in here. Harry, Ron, \nand Hermione walked past the Slyt herins, the Ravenclaws, and the \nHufflepuffs, and sat down with the re st of the Gryffindors at the far \nside of the Hall, next to Near ly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor \nghost. Pearly white and semitransparent, Nick was dressed tonight \nin his usual doublet, but with a part icularly large ruff, which served \nthe dual purpose of looking extra-festive, and insuring that his \nhead didn\u2019t wobble too much on his partially severed neck. \n\u201cGood evening,\u201d he said, beaming at them. \u201cSays who?\u201d said Harry, taking off his sneakers and emptying \nthem of water. \u201cHope they hu rry up with the Sorting.

Just then, a highly excited, breath-\nless voice called down the table. \n\u201cHiya, Harry!\u201d \nIt was Colin Creevey, a third year to whom Harry was some-\nthing of a hero. \n\u201cHi, Colin,\u201d said Harry warily. \u201cHarry, guess what? Guess what, Harry? My brother\u2019s starting! \nMy brother Dennis!\u201d \n\u201cEr \u2014 good,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cHe\u2019s really excited!\u201d said Coli n, practically bouncing up and \ndown in his seat. \u201cI just hope he\u2019s in Gryffindor! Keep your fingers \ncrossed, eh, Harry?\u201d \n\u201cEr \u2014 yeah, all right, \u201d said Harry.

He was judging by the Weasleys, all seven of whom ha d been put into Gryffindor. \n\u201cOh no, not necessarily,\u201d said He rmione. \u201cParvati Patil\u2019s twin\u2019s \nin Ravenclaw, and they\u2019re identical . You\u2019d think they\u2019d be together, \nwouldn\u2019t you?\u201d \nHarry looked up at the staff tabl e. There seemed to be rather \nmore empty seats there than usual. Hagrid, of course, was still fight-\ning his way across the lake with the first years; Professor McGonagall \nwas presumably supervising the dryi ng of the entrance hall floor, \nbut there was another empty chair too, and Harry couldn\u2019t think who else was missing. \n\u201cWhere\u2019s the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?\u201d said \nHermione, who was also looking up at the teachers. \nThey had never yet had a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher \nwho had lasted more than three te rms. Harry\u2019s favorite by far had \nTHE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT \n\u0091 175 \u0091 been Professor Lupin, who had resi gned last year. He looked up \nand down the staff table. There was definitely no new face there. \n\u201cMaybe they couldn\u2019t get anyone!\u201d said Hermione, looking \nanxious. \nHarry scanned the table more carefully. Tiny little Professor \nFlitwick, the Charms teacher, was si tting on a large pile of cushions \nbeside Professor Sprout, the He rbology teacher, whose hat was \naskew over her flyaway gray hair. She was talking to Professor Sin-\nistra of the Astronomy department. On Professor Sinistra\u2019s other \nside was the sallow-faced, hook-n osed, greasy-haired Potions mas-\nter, Snape \u2014 Harry\u2019s least favori te person at Hogwarts. Harry\u2019s \nloathing of Snape was matched only by Snape\u2019s hatred of him, a ha-\ntred which had, if possible, inte nsified last year, when Harry had \nhelped Sirius escape right unde r Snape\u2019s overlarge nose \u2014 Snape \nand Sirius had been enemies since their own school days. \nOn Snape\u2019s other side was an empty seat, which Harry guessed \nwas Professor McGonagall\u2019s. Next to it, and in the very center of \nthe table, sat Professor Dumbledo re, the headmaster , his sweeping \nsilver hair and beard shining in the candlelight, his magnificent \ndeep green robes embroidered wi th many stars and moons. The \ntips of Dumbledore\u2019s long, thin fingers were together and he was \nresting his chin upon them, staring up at th e ceiling through his \nhalf-moon spectacles as though lost in thou ght. Harry glanced up \nat the ceiling too. It was enchanted to look like the sky outside, and \nhe had never seen it look this stormy. Black and purple clouds were \nswirling across it, and as another thunderclap sounded outside, a \nfork of lightning flashed across it. \n\u201cOh hurry up,\u201d Ron moaned, be side Harry, \u201cI could eat a \nhippogriff.\u201d"

The coat was so big for \nhim that it looked as though he were draped in a furry black circus \ntent. His small face pr otruded from over the collar, looking almost \npainfully excited.

He looked positively delighted \nabout it. \nProfessor McGonagall now placed a three-legged stool on the \nground before the first years and, on top of it, an extremely old, \ndirty, patched wizard\u2019s hat. The firs t years stared at it. So did every-\none else. For a moment, there was silence. Then a long tear near the \nbrim opened wide like a mouth, and the hat broke into song: \n \nA thousand years or more ago, \nWhen I was newly sewn, \nThere lived four wizards of renown, \nWhose names are still well known: \nBold Gryffindor, from wild moor, \nFair Ravenclaw, from glen, \nSweet Hufflepuff, from valley broad, \nTHE TRIWIZARD TOURNAMENT \n\u0091 177 \u0091 Shrewd Slytherin, from fen. \nThey shared a wish, a hope, a dream, \nThey hatched a daring plan \nTo educate young sorcerers \nThus Hogwarts School began. \nNow each of these four founders \nFormed their own house, for each \nDid value different virtues \nIn the ones they had to teach. \nBy Gryffindor, the bravest were \nPrized far beyond the rest; \nFor Ravenclaw, the cleverest \nWould always be the best; \nFor Hufflepuff, hard workers were \nMost worthy of admission; \nAnd power-hungry Slytherin Loved those of great ambition. \nWhile still alive they did divide \nTheir favorites from the throng, \nYet how to pick the worthy ones \nWhen they were dead and gone? \n\u2018Twas Gryffindor who found the way, \nHe whipped me off his head \nThe founders put some brains in me \nSo I could choose instead! \nNow slip me snug about your ears, \nI\u2019ve never yet been wrong, \nI\u2019ll have a look inside your mind \nAnd tell where you belong!"

As he lifted his arm to drink, his cloak \nwas pulled a few inches from the ground, and Harry saw, below the \ntable, several inches of carved wo oden leg, ending in a clawed foot. \nDumbledore cleared his throat. \u201cAs I was saying,\u201d he said, smilin g at the sea of students before \nhim, all of whom were still gazi ng transfixed at Mad-Eye Moody, \n\u201cwe are to have the honor of host ing a very exciting event over the \ncoming months, an event that has not been held for over a century. \nIt is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tour-\nnament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re JOKING!\u201d said Fred Weasley loudly. \nThe tension that had filled the Hall ever since Moody\u2019s arrival \nsuddenly broke. Nearly everyone laughed, and Dumbledore chuck-\nled appreciatively. \n\u201cI am not joking, Mr. Weasley,\u201d he said, \u201cthough now that you \nmention it, I did hear an excelle nt one over the summer about a \ntroll, a hag, and a leprechaun who all go into a bar . . .\u201d \nProfessor McGonagall clea red her throat loudly. \n\u201cEr \u2014 but maybe this is not the ti me . . . no . . .\u201d said Dumble-\ndore, \u201cwhere was I?

A champion was selected to represent each school, \nand the three champions competed in three magi cal tasks. The \nschools took it in turns to host the tournament once every five \nyears, and it was generally agreed to be a most exce llent way of es-\ntablishing ties between young witc hes and wizards of different na-\ntionalities \u2014 until, that is, the de ath toll mounted so high that the \ntournament was discontinued.\u201d \n\u201cDeath toll ?\u201d Hermione whispered, looking alarmed. But her \nanxiety did not seem to be shared by the majority of students in the \nHall; many of them were whisperi ng excitedly to one another, and \nHarry himself was far more interest ed in hearing about the tourna-\nment than in worrying about deaths that had happened hundreds \nof years ago. \n\u201cThere have been several attempts over the centuries to reinstate \nthe tournament,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201cnone of which has \nbeen very successful. However, our own departments of Interna-\ntional Magical Cooperation and Magical Games and Sports have \ndecided the time is ripe for another attempt. We have worked hard \nover the summer to ensure that t his time, no champion will find \nhimself or herself in mortal danger. \n\u201cThe heads of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving \nwith their short-listed contenders in October, and the selection of \nthe three champions will take pl ace at Halloween. An impartial \njudge will decide which students are most worthy to compete for"

He was \nnot the only person who seemed to be visualizing himself as the \nHogwarts champion. At every Hous e table, Harry could see people \neither gazing raptly at Dumbledore, or else whisperi ng fervently to \ntheir neighbors. But then Dumbledore spoke again, and the Hall \nquieted once more. \n\u201cEager though I know all of you will be to bring the Triwizard \nCup to Hogwarts,\u201d he said, \u201cthe he ads of the participating schools, \na l o n g w i t h t h e M i n i s t r y o f M a g i c , h a v e a g r e e d t o i m p o s e a n a g e \nrestriction on contenders this year .

And \nnow, it is late, and I know how impo rtant it is to you all to be alert \nand rested as you enter your le ssons tomorrow morning. Bedtime! \nChop chop!\u201d \nDumbledore sat down again and turned to talk to Mad-Eye \nMoody. There was a great scraping and banging as all the students \ngot to their feet and swarmed toward the double doors into the en-trance hall. \n\u201cThey can\u2019t do that!\u201d said George Weasley, who had not joined \nthe crowd moving toward the door, but was st anding up and glar-\ning at Dumbledore. \u201cWe\u2019 re seventeen in April, why can\u2019t we have a \nshot?\u201d \n\u201cThey\u2019re not stopping me entering,\u201d said Fred stubbornly, also \nscowling at the top table. \u201cThe champions\u2019ll get to do all sorts of \nstuff you\u2019d never be allowed to do normally. And a thousand \nGalleons prize money!\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Ron, a faraway look on his face. \u201cYeah, a thousand \nGalleons . . .\u201d \n\u201cCome on,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cwe\u2019ll be the only ones left here if \nyou don\u2019t move.\u201d \nHarry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, an d George set off for the en-\ntrance hall, Fred and George debating the ways in which Dumble-\ndore might stop those who were un der seventeen from entering the \ntournament. \n\u201cWho\u2019s this impartial judge wh o\u2019s going to decide who the \nchampions are?\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cDunno,\u201d said Fred, \u201cbut it\u2019s them we\u2019ll have to fool.

A crackling fire warmed the circular com-\nmon room, which was full of sq uashy armchairs and tables.

The owls circled the tables, look-ing for the people to whom their letters and packages were ad-\ndressed. A large tawny owl soared down to Neville Longbottom and \ndeposited a parcel into his lap \u2014 Neville almost always forgot to \npack something.

Indeed, they looked less like plants than thick, black, giant slugs, protruding vertically out of the soil. Each \nwas squirming slightly and had a nu mber of large, shiny swellings \nupon it, which appeared to be full of liquid. \n\u201cBubotubers,\u201d Professor Sprout told them briskly. \u201cThey need \nsqueezing.

Recently under fire for its poor \nMAD-EYE MOODY \n\u0091 203 \u0091 crowd control at the Qu idditch World Cup, and \nstill unable to account fo r the disappearance of one \nof its witches, the Minist ry was plunged into fresh \nembarrassment yesterday by the antics of Arnold \nWeasley, of the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.\u201d \n \nMalfoy looked up. \n\u201cImagine them not even getting his name right, Weasley.

Mr. Weasley appears to have rushed to \nthe aid of \u201cMad-Eye\u201d Moody, the aged ex-Auror \nwho retired from the Ministry when no longer able \nto tell the difference be tween a handshake and at-\ntempted murder. Unsurprisingly, Mr. Weasley \nfound, upon arrival at Mr. Moody\u2019s heavily \nguarded house, that Mr. Moody had once again \nraised a false alarm. Mr. Weasley was forced to modify several memories before he could escape \nfrom the policemen, but refused to answer Daily \nProphet questions about why he had involved the \nMinistry in such an undignified and potentially \nembarrassing scene."

Moody jerked his wand, and th e spider rose onto two of its \nhind legs and went into what was unmistakably a tap dance. \nEveryone was laughing \u2014 everyone except Moody. \n\u201cThink it\u2019s funny, do you?\u201d he growled. \u201cYou\u2019d like it, would \nyou, if I did it to you?\u201d \nThe laughter died away almost instantly. \n\u201cTotal control,\u201d said Moody quietly as the spider balled itself up \nand began to roll over and over. \u201cI could make it jump out of the \nwindow, drown itself, th row itself down one of your throats . . .\u201d \nRon gave an invo luntary shudder. \n\u201cYears back, there were a lot of witches and wizards being con-\ntrolled by the Imperius Curse,\u201d said Moody, and Harry knew he \nwas talking about the days in w hich Voldemort had been all-pow-\nerful. \u201cSome job for the Ministry, trying to sort out who was being \nforced to act, and who was ac ting of their own free will. \n\u201cThe Imperius Curse can be fo ught, and I\u2019ll be teaching you \nhow, but it takes real strength of character, and not everyone\u2019s \ngot it. Better avoid being hit with it if you can. CONSTANT \nVIGILANCE!\u201d he barked, and everyone jumped. \nMoody picked up the somersaulting spider and threw it back \ninto the jar. \n\u201cAnyone else know one? Another illegal curse?\u201d \nHermione\u2019s hand flew into the ai r again and so, to Harry\u2019s slight \nsurprise, did Neville\u2019s. The only class in which Neville usually vol-unteered information was Herbolog y, which was easily his best \nsubject. Neville looked su rprised at his own daring."

The silence was broken, not \nby Ron, who in any case looked a s t h o u g h h e w a s t e m p o r a r i l y \ndumbstruck, but by a soft tap, tap on the window. Harry looked \nacross the now empty common room and saw, illuminated by the \nmoonlight, a snow y owl perched on the windowsill. \n\u201cHedwig!\u201d he shouted, and he la unched himself out of his chair \nand across the room to pull open the window. \nHedwig flew inside, soared across the room, and landed on the \ntable on top of Harry\u2019s predictions. \n\u201cAbout time!\u201d said Har ry, hurrying after her. \n\u201cShe\u2019s got an answer!\u201d said Ron ex citedly, pointing at the grubby \npiece of parchment tied to Hedwig\u2019s leg. \nHarry hastily untied it and sa t down to read, whereupon Hed-\nwig fluttered onto his knee, hooting softly."

Harry read it aloud: \n \nHarry \u2014 \nI\u2019m flying north immediately. Th is news about your scar is \nthe latest in a series of strang e rumors that have reached me \nhere. If it hurts again, go straight to Dumbledore \u2014 they\u2019re \nsaying he\u2019s got Mad-Eye out of retirement, which means he\u2019s \nreading the signs, even if no one else is. \nI\u2019ll be in touch soon. My best to Ron and Hermione. Keep \nyour eyes open, Harry. \n \n Harry looked up at Ron and Hermio ne, who stared back at him. \n\u201cHe\u2019s flying north?\u201d Hermione whispered. \u201cHe\u2019s coming back?\u201d \n\u201cDumbledore\u2019s reading what si gns?\u201d said Ron, looking per-\nplexed. \u201cHarry \u2014 what\u2019s up?\u201d \nFor Harry had just hit himself in the forehead with his fist, jolt-\ning Hedwig out of his lap. \n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t\u2019ve told him!\u201d Harry said furiously. \n\u201cWhat are you on about?\u201d said Ron in surprise. \n\u201cIt\u2019s made him think he\u2019s got to come back!\u201d said Harry, now \nslamming his fist on the table so that Hedwig land ed on the back \nof Ron\u2019s chair, hooting indignantly. \u201cComing back, because he thinks I\u2019m in trouble! And ther e\u2019s nothing wrong with me!

Why hadn\u2019t he kept his mouth shut? A few seconds\u2019 pain and \nhe\u2019d had to blab. . . . If he\u2019d ju st had the sense to keep it to \nhimself. . . . \nHe heard Ron come up into th e dormitory a short while later, \nbut did not speak to him. For a lo ng time, Harry lay staring up at \nthe dark canopy of his bed. The dormitory was completely silent, \nand, had he been less preoccupied, Harry would have realized that the absence of Neville\u2019s usual snores meant that he was not the only \none lying awake. \nC H A P T E R F I F T E E N \n \n\u0091 228 \u0091 \nBEA UXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG \n \n \narly next morning, Harry woke wi th a plan fully formed in his \nmind, as though his sleeping br ain had been working on it all \nnight. He got up, dressed in the pale dawn light, left the dormitory \nwithout waking Ron, and went ba ck down to the deserted common \nroom. Here he took a piece of parchment from the table upon which \nhis Divination homework still la y and wrote the following letter: \n \nDear Sirius, \nI reckon I just imagined my scar hurting, I was half asleep \nwhen I wrote to you last time. There\u2019s no point coming back, \neverything\u2019s fine here. Don\u2019t worry about me, my head feels completely normal. \n \n \nHe then climbed out of the portra it hole, up through the silent \ncastle (held up only br iefly by Peeves, who trie d to overturn a large E \nBEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG \n\u0091 229 \u0091 vase on him halfway along the four th-floor corridor), finally arriv-\ning at the Owlery, which was situat ed at the top of West Tower. \nThe Owlery was a circular stone room, rather cold and drafty, \nbecause none of the windows had glass in them. The floor was \nentirely covered in straw, owl dr oppings, and the regurgitated \nskeletons of mice and voles. Hund reds upon hundreds of owls of \nevery breed imaginable were nestled here on perches that rose right \nup to the top of the tower, nearly all of them asleep, though here \nand there a round amber eye glared at Harry. He spotted Hedwig \nnestled between a barn owl and a ta wny, and hurried over to her, \nsliding a little on the dropping-strewn floor. \nIt took him a while to persuade her to wake up and then to look \nat him, as she kept shuffling around on her perch, showing him her \ntail. She was evidently still furiou s about his lack of gratitude the \nprevious night. In the end, it wa s Harry suggesting she might be too \ntired, and that perhaps he would ask Ron to borrow Pigwidgeon, that made her stick out her leg and allow him to tie the letter to it. \n\u201cJust find him, all right?\u201d Harry sa id, stroking her back as he car-\nried her on his arm to one of the holes in the wall. \u201cBefore the de-\nmentors do.\u201d \nShe nipped his finger, perhaps rather harder than she would or-\ndinarily have done, but hooted softly in a reas suring sort of way all \nthe same. Then she spread her wings and took off into the sunrise. Harry watched her fly ou t of sight with the familiar feeling of un-\nease back in his stomach. He had been so sure that Sirius\u2019s reply \nwould alleviate his worries ra ther than increasing them. \n\u201cThat was a lie, Harry,\u201d said Hermione sharply over breakfast, \nwhen he told her and Ron what he had done. \u201cYou didn\u2019t imagine \nyour scar hurting and you know it.\u201d"

True, he could not stop himself from looking anx-\niously around every morning when th e post owls arrived, nor, late \nat night before he went to sleep, prevent himself from seeing horri-\nble visions of Sirius, cornered by dementors down some dark Lon-\ndon street, but betweentimes he tried to keep his mind off his \ngodfather. He wished he still had Quidditch to distract him; noth-\ning worked so well on a troubled mind as a good, hard training ses-\nsion. On the other hand, their lessons were becoming more \ndifficult and demanding than ever before, particularly Moody\u2019s \nDefense Against the Dark Arts. \nTo their surprise, Professor Moody had announced that he \nwould be putting the Imperius Curse on each of them in turn, to \ndemonstrate its power and to see whether they could resist its ef-\nfects. \n\u201cBut \u2014 but you said it\u2019s illegal, Professor,\u201d said Hermione un-\ncertainly as Moody cleared away the desks with a sweep of his \nwand, leaving a large clear space in the middle of the room. \u201cYou \nsaid \u2014 to use it agains t another human was \u2014\u201d \n\u201cDumbledore wants you taught what it feels like ,\u201d said Moody, \nhis magical eye swiveling onto He rmione and fixing her with an \neerie, unblinking stare. \u201cIf you\u2019d rather learn the hard way \u2014 when \nsomeone\u2019s putting it on you so th ey can control you completely \u2014 \nfine by me.

Hermione went \nvery pink and muttered something about not meaning that she \nwanted to leave. Harry and Ron gr inned at each other. They knew \nHermione would rather eat bubotuber pus than miss such an im-\nportant lesson. \nMoody began to beckon students forward in turn and put the \nImperius Curse upon them. Harr y watched as, one by one, his \nclassmates did the most extraordin ary things under its influence. \nDean Thomas hopped three times around the room, singing the \nnational anthem. Lavender Brown imitated a squirrel. Neville per-\nformed a series of quite astonis hing gymnastics he would certainly \nnot have been capable of in his normal state. Not one of them \nseemed to be able to fight off the curse, and each of them recovered \nonly when Moody had removed it. \n\u201cPotter,\u201d Moody grow led, \u201cyou next.\u201d \nHarry moved forward into the mi ddle of the classroom, into the \nspace that Moody had cleared of desks. Moody raised his wand, \npointed it at Harry, and said, \u201c Imperio !\u201d \nIt was the most wonderful feeling. Harry felt a floating sensation \nas every thought and worry in hi s head was wiped gently away, \nleaving nothing but a va gue, untraceable happ iness. He stood there \nfeeling immensely relaxed, only di mly aware of everyone watching \nhim. \nAnd then he heard Mad-Eye Moody \u2019s voice, echoing in some \ndistant chamber of his empty brain: Jump onto the desk . . . jump \nonto the desk. . . . \nHarry bent his knees obedie ntly, preparing to spring. \nJump onto the desk. . . . \nWhy, though? Another voice had aw oken in the back of his brain."

Hermione stopped talking abruptly; she and \nRon watched Hedwig anxiously as she fluttered down onto Harry\u2019s \nshoulder, folded her wings, an d held out her leg wearily. \nHarry pulled off Sirius\u2019s reply and offered Hedw ig his bacon \nrinds, which she ate gratefully. Then, checking that Fred and \nGeorge were safely immersed in further discussions about the Tri-\nwizard Tournament, Harr y read out Sirius\u2019s letter in a whisper to \nRon and Hermione. \n \nNice try, Harry. \nI\u2019m back in the country and we ll hidden. I want you to keep \nme posted on everything that\u2019s going on at Hogwarts. Don\u2019t use \nHedwig, keep changing owls, and don\u2019t worry about me, just \nwatch out for yourself. Don\u2019t forget what I said about your scar. \n \n \n\u201cWhy d\u2019you have to keep changing owls?\u201d Ron asked in a low \nvoice. \n\u201cHedwig\u2019ll attract too much att ention,\u201d said Hermione at once. \n\u201cShe stands out. A snowy owl that keeps returning to wherever he\u2019s \nhiding . . .

When the bell rang early, Harry, Ron, and \nHermione hurried up to Gryffin dor Tower, deposi ted their bags \nand books as they had been instru cted, pulled on their cloaks, and \nrushed back downstairs in to the entrance hall. \nThe Heads of Houses were orderi ng their students into lines. \n\u201cWeasley, straighten your hat, \u201d Professor McGo nagall snapped \nat Ron. \u201cMiss Patil, take that ridiculous thing out of your hair.\u201d \nParvati scowled and removed a la rge ornamental butterfly from \nthe end of her plait. \n\u201cFollow me, please,\u201d said Profe ssor McGonagall. \u201cFirst years in \nfront . . . no pushing. . . .\u201d \nThey filed down the steps and lined up in front of the castle.

As the gigantic black shape \nskimmed over the treetops of the Forbidden Forest and the lights shining from the castle windows hit it, they saw a gigantic, powder-\nblue, horse-drawn carriage, the size of a large house, soaring toward \nBEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG \n\u0091 243 \u0091 them, pulled through the air by a dozen winged horses, all palomi-\nnos, and each the size of an elephant. \nThe front three rows of students drew backward as the carriage \nhurtled ever lower, coming in to land at a tr emendous speed \u2014 \nthen, with an almighty crash th at made Neville jump backward \nonto a Slytherin fifth year\u2019s foot , the horses\u2019 hooves, larger than \ndinner plates, hit the ground. A se cond later, the carriage landed \ntoo, bouncing upon its vast wheels, while the golden horses tossed \ntheir enormous heads and rolled large, fiery red eyes. \nHarry just had time to see that the door of the carriage bore a \ncoat of arms (two crossed, golden wands, each emitting three stars) \nbefore it opened. \nA boy in pale blue robes jumped down from the carriage, bent \nforward, fumbled for a moment wi th something on the carriage \nfloor, and unfolded a set of golden steps. He sprang back respect-\nfully. Then Harry saw a shining, high-heeled black shoe emerging \nfrom the inside of the carriage \u2014 a shoe the size of a child\u2019s sled \u2014 \nfollowed, almost immediately, by the largest woman he had ever \nseen in his life.

Yet somehow \u2014 maybe simply \nbecause he was used to Hagrid \u2014 this woman (now at the foot of \nthe steps, and looking around at the waiting, wide-eyed crowd) \nseemed even more unnaturally larg e.

Dumbledore, \nthough tall himself, had barely to bend to kiss it. \n\u201cMy dear Madame Maxime,\u201d he said. \u201cWelcome to Hogwarts.\u201d \n\u201cDumbly-dorr,\u201d said Madame Maxime in a deep voice. \u201cI \u2019ope I \nfind you well?\u201d \n\u201cIn excellent form, I thank you,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cMy pupils,\u201d said Madame Maxi me, waving one of her enor-\nmous hands carelessly behind her. \nHarry, whose attention had be en focused completely upon \nMadame Maxime, now noticed that about a dozen bo ys and girls, \nall, by the look of them, in thei r late teens, had emerged from the \ncarriage and were now standing behind Madame Maxime.

But then \u2014 \n\u201cCan you hear somethin g?\u201d said Ron suddenly. \nHarry listened; a loud and oddly eerie noise was drifting toward \nthem from out of the darkness: a muffled rumbling and sucking \nsound, as though an immense vacuum cleaner were moving along a riverbed. . . . \n\u201cThe lake!\u201d yelled Lee Jordan, po inting down at it. \u201cLook at the \nlake!\u201d \nFrom their position at the top of the la wns overlooking the \ngrounds, they had a clear view of the smooth black surface of the \nwater \u2014 except that the surface was suddenly not smooth at all. \nSome disturbance was taking plac e deep in the center; great bub-\nbles were forming on the surface, waves were now washing over the \nmuddy banks \u2014 and then, out in the very middle of the lake, a \nwhirlpool appeared, as if a giant plug had just been pulled out of \nthe lake\u2019s floor. . . . \nWhat seemed to be a long, black pole began to rise slowly out of \nthe heart of the whirlpool . . . an d then Harry saw the rigging. . . . \n\u201cIt\u2019s a mast!\u201d he said to Ron and Hermione. \nSlowly, magnificently, the ship rose out of the water, gleaming in \nthe moonlight. It had a strangely skeletal look about it, as though \nit were a resurrected wreck, and the dim, misty lights shimmering \nat its portholes looked like ghostly eyes. Finally, wi th a great slosh-\ning noise, the ship emerged entir ely, bobbing on the turbulent \nwater, and began to glide toward the bank. A few moments later, \nthey heard the splash of an anchor being thrown down in the shal-\nlows, and the thud of a plank being lowered onto the bank. \nPeople were disembar king; they could see their silhouettes \nBEAUXBATONS AND DURMSTRANG \n\u0091 247 \u0091 passing the lights in the ship\u2019s portholes. All of them, Harry no-\nticed, seemed to be built along th e lines of Crabbe and Goyle . . . \nbut then, as they drew nearer, wa lking up the lawn s into the light \nstreaming from the entrance hall, he saw that their bulk was really \ndue to the fact that they were wear ing cloaks of some kind of shaggy, \nmatted fur. But the man who was le ading them up to the castle was \nwearing furs of a different sort: sleek and silver, like his hair. \n\u201cDumbledore!\u201d he called heartily as he walked up the slope. \n\u201cHow are you, my dear fellow, how are you?\u201d \n\u201cBlooming, thank you, Professor Karkaroff,\u201d Dumbledore replied. \nKarkaroff had a fruity, unctuous voice; when he stepped into the \nlight pouring from the front doors of the castle they saw that he \nwas tall and thin like Dumbledore, but his white hair was short, and his goatee (finishing in a sma ll curl) did not en tirely hide his \nrather weak chin. When he reac hed Dumbledore, he shook hands \nwith both of his own. \n\u201cDear old Hogwarts,\u201d he said, look ing up at the castle and smil-\ning; his teeth were rather yellow , and Harry noticed that his smile \ndid not extend to his eyes, which remained cold and shrewd. \u201cHow \ngood it is to be here, how good. . . . Viktor, come along, into the \nwarmth . . . you don\u2019t mind, Dumble dore? Viktor has a slight head \ncold. . . .\u201d \nKarkaroff beckoned forward one of his students. As the boy \npassed, Harry caught a glimpse of a prominent curved nose and \nthick black eyebrows. He didn\u2019t need the punch on the arm Ron \ngave him, or the hiss in his ea r, to recognize that profile. \n\u201cHarry \u2014 it\u2019s Krum !\u201d \nC H A P T E R S I X T E E N \n \n\u0091 248 \u0091 THE GOBLET OF FIRE \n \n \n \ndon\u2019t believe it!\u201d Ron said, in a stunned voice, as the Hogwarts \nstudents filed back up the step s behind the party from Durm-\nstrang. \u201cKrum, Harry! Viktor Krum !\u201d \n\u201cFor heaven\u2019s sake, Ron, he\u2019s only a Quidditch player,\u201d said \nHermione. \n\u201cOnly a Quidditch player ?\u201d Ron said, looking at her as though he \ncouldn\u2019t believe his ears. \u201cHermione \u2014 he\u2019s one of the best Seekers \nin the world! I had no idea he was still at school!\u201d \nAs they recrossed the entrance hall with the rest of the Hogwarts \nstudents heading for the Great Ha ll, Harry saw Lee Jordan jump-\ning up and down on the so les of his feet to get a better look at the \nback of Krum\u2019s head. Several sixth- year girls were frantically search-\ning their pockets as they walked \u2014 \n\u201cOh I don\u2019t believe it , I haven\u2019t got a sing le quill on me \u2014\u201d \n\u201cD\u2019you think he\u2019d sign my hat in lipstick?\u201d \n I \nTHE GOBLET OF FIRE \n\u0091 249 \u0091 \u201cReally,\u201d Hermione said loftily as they passed the girls, now \nsquabbling over the lipstick. \n\u201cI\u2019m getting his autograph if I can, \u201d said Ron. \u201cYou haven\u2019t got a \nquill, have you, Harry?\u201d \n\u201cNope, they\u2019re upstairs in my bag,\u201d said Harry. \nThey walked over to the Gryf findor table and sat down. Ron \ntook care to sit on the side fa cing the doorway, because Krum and \nhis fellow Durmstrang students were still gathered around it, appar-\nently unsure about where they should sit. The students from Beaux-\nbatons had chosen seats at the Ravenclaw table. They were looking \naround the Great Hall with glum ex pressions on their faces. Three \nof them were still clutching scarves and shawls around their heads. \n\u201cIt\u2019s not that cold,\u201d said Hermione defensively. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they \nbring cloaks?\u201d \n\u201cOver here!

Harry could see Malfoy, Crabbe, \nand Goyle looking very smug about this. As he watched, Malfoy \nbent forward to speak to Krum. \n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s right, smarm up to him, Malfoy,\u201d said Ron \nscathingly. \u201cI bet Krum can see right through him, though . . . bet \nhe gets people fawning over him all the time. . . . Where d\u2019you \nreckon they\u2019re going to sleep? We could offer him a space in our \ndormitory, Harry . . . I wouldn\u2019t mind giving him my bed, I could \nkip on a camp bed.\u201d"

He \nwas wearing his moldy old tailcoat in honor of the occasion.

The house-\nelves in the kitchen seemed to have pulled out all the stops; there \nwas a greater variety of dishes in front of them than Harry had ever \nseen, including several that were definitely foreign. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d said Ron, pointing at a large dish of some sort of \nshellfish stew that stood beside a large steak-and-kidney pudding. \n\u201cBouillabaisse,\u201d said Hermione. \n\u201cBless you,\u201d said Ron. \n\u201cIt\u2019s French, \u201d said Hermione, \u201cI had it on holiday summer before \nlast.

Cho happened to be sitting only a few places away from the \ngirl with the silvery hair. \n\u201cWhen you\u2019ve both put your eyes back in,\u201d said Hermione \nbriskly, \u201cyou\u2019ll be able to see who\u2019s just arrived.\u201d \nShe was pointing up at the staf f table. The two remaining empty \nseats had just been fi lled. Ludo Bagman was no w sitting on Profes-\nsor Karkaroff\u2019s other side, while Mr . Crouch, Percy\u2019s boss, was next \nto Madame Maxime. \n\u201cWhat are they doing here?\u201d said Harry in surprise. \n\u201cThey organized the Triwizard To urnament, didn\u2019t they?\u201d said \nHermione. \u201cI suppose they wanted to be here to see it start.\u201d \nWhen the second course arrived they noticed a number of unfa-\nmiliar desserts too. Ro n examined an odd sort of pale blancmange \nclosely, then moved it carefully a fe w inches to his right, so that it \nwould be clearly visible from th e Ravenclaw table. The girl who \nlooked like a veela appeared to have eaten enough, however, and \ndid not come over to get it. \nOnce the golden plates had b een wiped clean, Dumbledore \nstood up again. A pleasa nt sort of tension se emed to fill the Hall \nnow. Harry felt a slight thrill of excitement, wondering what was \ncoming. Several seats down from them, Fred and George were \nleaning forward, staring at Dumb ledore with great concentration. \n\u201cThe moment has come,\u201d said Dumbledore, smiling around at \nthe sea of upturned faces. \u201cThe Triwizard Tournament is about to start. I would like to say a few wo rds of explanation before we bring \nin the casket \u2014\u201d"

But first, let me introduce, for those who do not know them, \nMr. Bartemius Crouch, Head of th e Department of International \nMagical Cooperation\u201d \u2014 there was a smattering of polite ap-\nplause \u2014 \u201cand Mr. Ludo Bagman, Head of the Department of \nMagical Games and Sports.\u201d \nThere was a much louder round of applause for Bagman than \nfor Crouch, perhaps beca use of his fame as a Beater, or simply be-\ncause he looked so much more likable. He acknowledged it with a \njovial wave of his hand. Bartemiu s Crouch did not smile or wave \nwhen his name was announced. Re membering him in his neat suit \nat the Quidditch World Cup, Harry thought he looked strange in \nwizard\u2019s robes. His toothbrush mustache and severe parting looked \nvery odd next to Dumb ledore\u2019s long whit e hair and beard. \n\u201cMr. Bagman and Mr. Crouch have worked tirelessly over the \nlast few months on the arrangements for the Triwizard Tourna-\nment,\u201d Dumbledore continued, \u201ca nd they will be joining myself, \nProfessor Karkaroff, and Madame Maxime on the panel that will \njudge the champions\u2019 efforts.\u201d \nAt the mention of the word \u201ccha mpions,\u201d the a ttentiveness of \nthe listening students seemed to sharpen. Perhaps Dumbledore had \nnoticed their sudden stillness, for he smiled as he said, \u201cThe casket, then, if you please, Mr. Filch.\u201d \nFilch, who had been lurking unno ticed in a far corner of the \nHall, now approached Dumbledore carrying a great wooden chest \nencrusted with je wels. It looked extremely old. A murmur of \nexcited interest rose from the watching students; Dennis Creevey \nTHE GOBLET OF FIRE \n\u0091 255 \u0091 actually stood on his ch air to see it properly, but, being so tiny, his \nhead hardly rose ab ove anyone else\u2019s. \n\u201cThe instructions for the tasks the ch ampions will face this year \nhave already been examined by Mr. Crouch and Mr. Bagman,\u201d said \nDumbledore as Filch placed the ches t carefully on the table before \nhim, \u201cand they have made the necessary arrangements for each \nchallenge. There will be three tasks, spaced throughout the school \nyear, and they will test the champions in many differ ent ways . . . \ntheir magical prowess \u2014 their da ring \u2014 their powers of deduc-\ntion \u2014 and, of course, their ab ility to cope with danger.\u201d \nAt this last word, the Hall was filled with a silence so absolute \nthat nobody seemed to be breathing. \n\u201cAs you know, three champions compete in the tournament,\u201d \nDumbledore went on calmly, \u201cone from each of the participating schools. They will be marked on how well they perform each of the \nTournament tasks and the champion with the highest total after \ntask three will win the Triwizard Cup. The ch ampions will be cho-\nsen by an impartial select or: the Goblet of Fire.\u201d \nDumbledore now took out his wand and tapped three times \nupon the top of the casket. The lid creaked slowly open. Dumble-\ndore reached inside it and pulled out a large, roughly hewn wooden \ncup. It would have been entirely unremarkable had it not been full \nto the brim with dancing blue-white flames. \nDumbledore closed the casket and placed the goblet carefully on \ntop of it, where it would be clearl y visible to everyone in the Hall. \n\u201cAnybody wishing to submit themselves as champion must write \ntheir name and school clearly upon a slip of parchment and drop it \ninto the goblet,\u201d said Dumbledore. \u201cAspiring champions have \ntwenty-four hours in which to put their names forward.

It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, \nmunching their toast, as Harry told Hermio ne exactly what had \nhappened after he had left the Gry ffindor table the night before. To \nhis immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question. \n\u201cWell, of course I knew you hadn\u2019t entered yourself,\u201d she said when \nhe\u2019d finished telling her about th e scene in the chamber off the Hall. \n\u201cThe look on your face when Du mbledore read out your name!

One Herbology lesson was en ough to demons trate this. It \nwas plain that the Huff lepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their \nchampion\u2019s glory; a feeling exacerba ted, perhaps, by the fact that \nHufflepuff House very rarely got an y glory, and th at Cedric was \none of the few who ha d ever given them any, having beaten \nGryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin Finch-\nFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk \nto him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the \nsame tray \u2014 though they did laug h rather unpleasantly when one \nof the Bouncing Bulb s wriggled free from Harry\u2019s grip and \nsmacked him hard in th e face.

The skrewts were now over \nthree feet long, and extremely powe rful. No longer shell-less and \ncolorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. \nThey looked like a cross betwee n giant scorpions and elongated \ncrabs \u2014 but still without recognizable heads or eyes.

Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him \nfrom all sides. \nHe could understand the Hufflepuffs\u2019 attitude, even if he didn\u2019t \nlike it; they had their own cham pion to support.

Exceptionally handsome, with his \nstraight nose, dark hair, and gray eyes, it was hard to say who was \nreceiving more admiration these days, Cedric or Viktor Krum. \nHarry actually saw the same sixth-year girls who had been so keen \nto get Krum\u2019s autograph begging Cedric to sign their school bags \none lunchtime. \nMeanwhile there was no reply from Sirius, Hedwig was refusing \nto come anywhere near him, Professor Trelawney was predicting his death with even more certainty than usual, and he did so badly at \nSummoning Charms in Professor Flitwick\u2019s class that he was given extra homework \u2014 the only person to get any, apart from Neville. \n\u201cIt\u2019s really not that difficult, Harry,\u201d Hermione tried to reassure \nhim as they left Flitwick\u2019s cl ass \u2014 she had been making objects \nTHE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS \n\u0091 297 \u0091 zoom across the room to her all lesson, as though she were some \nsort of weird magnet for board dusters, wastepaper baskets, and \nlunascopes. \u201cYou just weren\u2019 t concentrating properly \u2014\u201d \n\u201cWonder why that was,\u201d said Harry darkly as Cedric Diggory \nwalked past, surrounded by a large group of simpering girls, all of \nwhom looked at Harry as though he were a particularly large Blast-\nEnded Skrewt. \u201cStill \u2014 never mind, eh? Double Potions to look \nforward to this afternoon. . . .\u201d \nDouble Potions was always a horri ble experience, but these days \nit was nothing short of torture.

Harry counted thre e gold teeth. \nShe reached again into her crocodile bag and drew out a long acid-\ngreen quill and a roll of parc hment, which she stretched out \nbetween them on a crate of Mrs. Skower\u2019s All-Purpose Magical \nMess Remover. She put the tip of the green quill into her mouth, \nsucked it for a moment with appare nt relish, then pl aced it upright \non the parchment, where it stood balanced on its point, quivering \nslightly. \n\u201cTesting . . . my name is Rita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter.\u201d \nHarry looked down quickly at the quill. The moment Rita \nSkeeter had spoken, the green quil l had started to scribble, skid-\nding across the parchment: \n \nAttractive blonde Rita Skeeter , forty-three, whose savage \nquill has punctured many inflated reputations \u2014 \n \n\u201cLovely,\u201d said Rita Skeeter, yet again, and she ripped the top \npiece of parchment off, crumpled it up, and stuffed it into her \nTHE WEIGHING OF THE WANDS \n\u0091 305 \u0091 handbag. Now she leaned toward Harry and said, \u201cSo, Harry . . . \nwhat made you decide to enter the Triwizard Tournament?\u201d \n\u201cEr \u2014\u201d said Harry agai n, but he was distra cted by the quill. \nEven though he wasn\u2019t speaking , it was dashing across the parch-\nment, and in its wake he coul d make out a fresh sentence: \n \nAn ugly scar, souvenir of a tragic past, disfigures the \notherwise charming face of Harry Potter, whose eyes \u2014 \n \n\u201cIgnore the quill, Harry,\u201d said Rita Skeeter firmly. Reluctantly, \nHarry looked up at her instead. \u201cNow \u2014 why did you decide to \nenter the tournament, Harry?\u201d \n\u201cI didn\u2019t,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI don\u2019t know how my name got into the \nGoblet of Fire. I didn \u2019t put it in there.\u201d \nRita Skeeter raised one he avily penciled eyebrow. \n\u201cCome now, Harry, there\u2019s no need to be scared of getting into \ntrouble. We all know you shouldn\u2019t really have entered at all. But don\u2019t worry about that. Our readers love a rebel.\u201d \n\u201cBut I didn\u2019t enter,\u201d Harry re peated. \u201cI don\u2019t know who \u2014\u201d \n\u201cHow do you feel about the tasks ahead?\u201d said Rita Skeeter. \n\u201cExcited? Nervous?\u201d \n\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought . . . yeah, nervous, I suppose,\u201d said \nHarry. His insides squirmed uncomfortably as he spoke. \n\u201cChampions have died in the past, haven\u2019t they?\u201d said Rita \nSkeeter briskly. \u201cHave you th ought about that at all?\u201d \n\u201cWell . . . they say it\u2019s going to be a lot safer this year,\u201d said \nHarry. \nThe quill whizzed across the parchment between them, back \nand forward as though it were skating."

Talki ng in low voices, they passed \nright by Hermione with out looking at her. Harry backed into the \nwall of Honeydukes to stop Rita Skeeter from hitting him with her \ncrocodile-skin handbag. When they were gone, Harry said, \u201cShe\u2019s \nstaying in the village. I bet she\u2019s coming to watch the first task.\u201d \nAs he said it, his stomach flooded with a wave of molten panic. \nHe didn\u2019t mention this; he and Hermione hadn\u2019t discussed what was coming in the first task much ; he had the feeling she didn\u2019t \nwant to think about it. \n\u201cShe\u2019s gone,\u201d said Hermione, looking right through Harry to-\nward the end of the street. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go and have a butterbeer \nin the Three Broomsticks, it\u2019s a bit cold, isn\u2019t it? You don\u2019t have to \ntalk to Ron!\u201d she added irritably, co rrectly interpreting his silence. \nThe Three Broomsticks was packed, mainly with Hogwarts stu-\ndents enjoying their free afternoon, but also with a variety of mag-\nical people Harry rarely saw anywhe re else. Harry supposed that as \nHogsmeade was the only all-wizard vi llage in Britain, it was a bit of \na haven for creatures like hags, who were not as adept as wizards at \ndisguising themselves. \nIt was very hard to move throug h crowds in the Invisibility \nCloak, in case you accidentally trod on someone, which tended to \nlead to awkward questions. Harry edged slowly toward a spare \ntable in the corner while Hermione went to buy drinks. On his way \nthrough the pub, Harry spotted Ron, who was sitting with Fred, George, and Lee Jordan. Resisting th e urge to give Ron a good hard \npoke in the back of the head, he finally re ached the table and sat \ndown at it. \nHermione joined him a moment later and slipped him a butter-\nbeer under his cloak."

All of them looked \ncheerful and relaxed. Ernie Macm illan and Hannah Abbot were \nswapping Chocolate Frog cards at a nearby table; both of them \nsporting Support Cedric Diggory ! badges on their cloaks.

He wouldn\u2019t be \nTHE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL \n\u0091 321 \u0091 wearing the Invisibility Cloak, fo r one thing. Ron would be sitting \nwith him.

Every time \nhe had seen Cedric lately, he ha d been surrounded by admirers and \nlooking nervous but excited. Harr y glimpsed Fleur Delacour from \ntime to time in the corridors; she looked exactly as she always did, \nhaughty and unruffled.

Harry \nwondered why he hadn\u2019t spotted him at once, as Hagrid was so \nlarge, but standing up carefully, he saw that Hagrid had been lean-\ning low, talking to Professor Moody. Hagrid had his usual enor-\nmous tankard in front of him, but Moody was drin king from his \nhip flask. Madam Rosmerta, the pr etty landlady, didn\u2019t seem to \nthink much of this; sh e was looking askance at Moody as she col-\nlected glasses from tables around them.

Moody, \nhowever, paused, his magical eye on the corner where Harry was \nstanding. He tapped Hagrid in the small of the back (being unable \nto reach his shoulder), muttered something to him, and then the \npair of them made their way back across the pub toward Harry and Hermione\u2019s table. \n\u201cAll right, Hermione?\u201d said Hagrid loudly. \u201cHello,\u201d said Herm ione, smiling back. \nMoody limped around the table and bent down; Harry thought \nhe was reading the S.P.E.W. notebook, until he muttered, \u201cNice cloak, Potter.\u201d \nHarry stared at him in amazem ent.

Harry knew Hagrid \ncouldn\u2019t see him, but Moody had obviously told Hagrid he was \nthere. Hagrid now bent down on the pretext of reading the S.P.E.W. notebook as well, and said in a whisper so low that only \nHarry could hear it, \u201cHarry, meet me tonight at midnight at me \ncabin.

I don\u2019t know whether you sh ould go, Harry. . . .\u201d She looked \nnervously around and hissed, \u201cIt mi ght make you late for Sirius.\u201d \nIt was true that going down to Ha grid\u2019s at midnight would mean \ncutting his meeting with Sirius very fine indeed; Hermione sug-\ngested sending Hedwig down to Hagrid\u2019s to tell him he couldn\u2019t \ngo \u2014 always assuming she would consent to take the note, of \ncourse \u2014 Harry, however, thought it better just to be quick at what-\never Hagrid wanted him for. He was very curious to know what this might be; Hagrid had never asked Harry to visit him so late at night. \nAt half past eleven that evening , Harry, who had pretended to go \nup to bed early, pulled the Invisi bility Cloak back over himself and \ncrept back downstairs through the common room. Quite a few \npeople were still in there. The Creevey brothers had managed to get hold of a stack of Support Cedric Diggory ! badges and were trying to \nbewitch them to make them say Support Harry Potter ! instead. So \nfar, however, all they had manage d to do was get the badges stuck \non POTTER STINKS. Harry crept past them to the portrait hole \nand waited for a minute or so, ke eping an eye on his watch. Then \nHermione opened the Fat Lady fo r him from outside as they had \nplanned. He slipped pa st her with a whispered \u201cThanks!\u201d and set \noff through the castle. \nThe grounds were very dark. Harry walked down the lawn toward \nthe lights shining in Hagrid\u2019s ca bin. The inside of the enormous \nBeauxbatons carriage was also li t up; Harry could hear Madame \nMaxime talking inside it as he knocked on Hagrid\u2019s front door."

There was a silvery-blue one \nwith long, pointed horns, snapping and snarling at the wizards on \nthe ground; a smooth-scaled green one, which was writhing and \nstamping with all its might; a red one with an odd fringe of fine gold \nspikes around its face, which was shooting mushroom-shaped fire clouds into the air; an d a gigantic black one, more lizard-like than \nthe others, which was nearest to them. \nAt least thirty wizards, seven or eight to each dragon, were \nattempting to control them, pull ing on the chains connected to \nheavy leather straps around th eir necks and le gs.

Then he cr ept back under th e cover of the \ntrees and started to edge forward toward the place where the drag-\nons were. \nVery slowly and very carefully, Ha rry got to his feet and set off \nagain as fast as he could without making too much noise, hurrying \nthrough the darkness ba ck toward Hogwarts. \nHe had no doubt whatsoever what Karkaroff was up to. He had \nsneaked off his ship to try and find out what th e first task was going \nto be. He might even have spo tted Hagrid and Madame Maxime \nheading off around the forest togeth er \u2014 they were hardly difficult \nto spot at a distance . . . and now all Karkaroff had to do was fol-\nlow the sound of voices, and he , like Madame Maxime, would \nknow what was in store for the champions. \nBy the looks of it, the only ch ampion who would be facing the \nunknown on Tuesday was Cedric. \nHarry reached the castle, slipped in through the front doors, and \nbegan to climb the marble stairs; he was very out of breath, but he \ndidn\u2019t dare slow down. . . . He ha d less than five minutes to get up \nto the fire. . . . \n\u201cBalderdash!\u201d he gasped at the Fat Lady, who was snoozing in \nher frame in front of the portrait hole. \n\u201cIf you say so,\u201d she muttered sleepily, without opening her eyes, \nand the picture swung forward to admit him. Harry climbed in-\nside. The common room was deserted, and, judging by the fact \nthat it smelled quite normal, Hermione had not needed to set off \nany Dungbombs to ensure that he and Sirius got privacy. \nHarry pulled off the Invi sibility Cloak and th rew himself into an \narmchair in front of the fire. The room was in semidarkness; the \nTHE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL \n\u0091 331 \u0091 flames were the only source of light. Nearby, on a table, the Support \nCedric Diggory ! badges the Creeveys had been trying to improve \nwere glinting in the fi relight. They now read POTTER REALLY \nSTINKS. Harry looked back into the flames, and jumped. \nSirius\u2019s head was sitting in the fire. If Harry hadn\u2019t seen Mr. Dig-\ngory do exactly this back in the We asleys\u2019 kitchen, it would have \nscared him out of his wits. Instead, his face breaking into the first \nsmile he had worn for days, he scra mbled out of his chair, crouched \ndown by the hearth, and said, \u201cSirius \u2014 how\u2019re you doing?\u201d \nSirius looked different from Ha rry\u2019s memory of him. When they \nhad said good-bye, Sirius\u2019s face had been gaunt and sunken, sur-\nrounded by a quantity of long, black, matted hair \u2014 but the hair \nwas short and clean now, Sirius\u2019s face was fuller, and he looked \nyounger, much more like the on ly photograph Harry had of him, \nwhich had been taken at the Potters\u2019 wedding. \n\u201cNever mind me, how are you? \u201d said Sirius seriously. \n\u201cI\u2019m \u2014\u201d For a second, Harry tried to say \u201cfine\u201d \u2014 but he couldn\u2019t \ndo it.

Surely there could be nothing worse than dragons \ncoming? \n\u201cKarkaroff,\u201d said Sirius. \u201cHarry, he was a Death Eater.

He\u2019s not very popular in there, I can tell you. And since \nhe got out, from what I can tell, he\u2019s been teaching the Dark Arts \nto every student who passes throug h that school of his. So watch \nout for the Durmstrang champion as well.\u201d \n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cBut . . . are you saying Karkaroff \nput my name in the goblet? Because if he did, he\u2019s a really good \nactor. He seemed furious about it. He wanted to stop me from competing.\u201d \n \nTHE HUNGARIAN HORNTAIL \n\u0091 333 \u0091 \u201cWe know he\u2019s a good actor,\u201d said Sirius, \u201cbecause he convinced \nthe Ministry of Magic to set him free, didn\u2019t he? Now, I\u2019ve been \nkeeping an eye on the Daily Prophet, Harry \u2014\u201d \n\u201c\u2014 you and the rest of the world,\u201d said Harry bitterly. \n\u201c\u2014 and reading betwee n the lines of that Skeeter woman\u2019s arti-\ncle last month, Moody was attacked the night before he started at \nHogwarts. Yes, I know she says it was another false alarm,\u201d Sirius \nsaid hastily, seeing Harry about to speak, \u201cbut I don\u2019t think so, somehow. I think someone tried to stop him from getting to Hog-\nwarts. I think someone knew their job would be a lot more difficult \nwith him around. And no one\u2019s going to look into it too closely; Mad-Eye\u2019s heard intruders a bit too often. But that doesn\u2019t mean he \ncan\u2019t still spot the real thing. Moody was the best Auror the Min-\nistry ever had.\u201d \n\u201cSo . . . what are you saying?\u201d said Harry slowly. \u201cKarkaroff\u2019s \ntrying to kill me? But \u2014 why?\u201d \nSirius hesitated. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been hearing some very strange things,\u201d he said slowly. \n\u201cThe Death Eaters seem to be a bit more active than usual lately. \nThey showed themselves at the Qu idditch World Cup, didn\u2019t they? \nSomeone set off the Dark Mark . . . and then \u2014 did you hear \nabout that Ministry of Magi c witch who\u2019s gone missing?\u201d \n\u201cBertha Jorkins?\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cExactly . . . she disappeared in Albania, and that\u2019s definitely \nwhere Voldemort was rumored to be last . . . and she would have \nknown the Triwizard Tournament was coming up, wouldn\u2019t she?\u201d \n\u201cYeah, but . . . it\u2019s not very likely she\u2019d have walked straight into \nVoldemort, is it?\u201d said Harry."

He watched the bottom of the spiral staircase. Who had \ndecided to go for a stroll at one o\u2019clock in the morning, and stopped Sirius from telling him how to get past a dragon? \nIt was Ron.

Cedric did this \nweird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground . . . turned it into a dog . . . he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and \nit sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as \nwell \u2014 the dragon ch anged its mind halfwa y through and decided \nit would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance \u2014 well, that kind of worked too, it went all \nsleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and \nher skirt caught fire \u2014 she put it out with a bit of water out of her \nwand. And Krum \u2014 you won\u2019t believe this, but he didn\u2019t even \nthink of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it \nwith some sort of spell right in th e eye.

She was wearing a th ick magenta cloak with a furry \npurple collar today, and her cr ocodile-skin handbag was over her \narm. \nHagrid launched himself forward on top of the skrewt that was \ncornering Harry and Ron and flattened it; a blast of fire shot out of \nits end, withering the pumpkin plants nearby. \n\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d Hagrid asked Rita Skeeter as he slipped a loop of \nrope around the skrewt\u2019s sting and tightened it. \n\u201cRita Skeeter, Daily Prophet reporter,\u201d Rita replied, beaming at \nhim. Her gold teeth glinted. \n\u201cThought Dumbledore said you weren\u2019 allowed inside the \nschool anymore,\u201d said Hagrid, frow ning slightly as he got off the \nslightly squashed skrewt and starte d tugging it over to its fellows."

This \nyear, however, everyone in the four th year and above seemed to be \nstaying, and they all seemed to Ha rry to be obsessed with the com-\ning ball \u2014 or at leas t all the girls were, and it was amazing how \nmany girls Hogwarts suddenly seem ed to hold; he had never quite \nnoticed that before. Girls giggling and whispering in the corridors, \ngirls shrieking with laughter as boys passed them, girls excitedly \ncomparing notes on what they we re going to wear on Christmas \nnight. . . . \n\u201cWhy do they have to move in packs?\u201d Harry asked Ron as a \ndozen or so girls walked past them , sniggering and staring at Harry. \n\u201cHow\u2019re you supposed to get one on their own to ask them?\u201d \n\u201cLasso one?\u201d Ron suggested. \u201cGot any idea who you\u2019re going to \ntry?\u201d \nHarry didn\u2019t answer. He knew perfectly well whom he\u2019d like to \nask, but working up the nerve wa s something else. . . . Cho was a \nyear older than he was; she wa s very pretty; she was a very good \nQuidditch player, and she was also very popular. \nTHE UNEXPECTED TASK \n\u0091 389 \u0091 Ron seemed to know what was going on inside Harry\u2019s head. \n\u201cListen, you\u2019re not going to ha ve any trouble. You\u2019re a cham-\npion. You\u2019ve just beaten a Hung arian Horntail. I bet they\u2019ll be \nqueuing up to go with you.\u201d \nIn tribute to their recently repaired friendship, Ron had kept the \nbitterness in his voice to a bare minimum. Moreover, to Harry\u2019s \namazement, he turned out to be quite right. \nA curly-haired third-year Huffl epuff girl to whom Harry had \nnever spoken in his life asked him to go to the ball with her the very \nnext day. Harry was so taken aback he said no before he\u2019d even \nstopped to consider the matter. Th e girl walked off looking rather \nhurt, and Harry had to endure Dean \u2019s, Seamus\u2019s, and Ron\u2019s taunts \nabout her all through History of Magic. The following day, two \nmore girls asked him, a second year and (to his horror) a fifth year \nwho looked as though she might knock him out if he refused. \n\u201cShe was quite good-looking,\u201d said Ron fairly, after he\u2019d stopped \nlaughing. \n\u201cShe was a foot taller than me,\u201d said Harry, still unnerved. \n\u201cImagine what I\u2019d look like trying to dance with her.\u201d \nHermione\u2019s words abou t Krum kept coming back to him. \u201cThey \nonly like him because he\u2019s famous!\u201d Harry doubted very much if \nany of the girls who ha d asked to be his part ner so far would have \nwanted to go to the ball with him if he hadn\u2019t been a school cham-pion. Then he wondered if this would bother him if Cho asked \nhim. \nOn the whole, Harry had to admit that even with the embar-\nrassing prospect of opening the ball before him, life had definitely improved since he had got through the first task.

I won\u2019t even be able to hear the egg over this \nlot.\u201d \n\u201cOh I suppose not,\u201d she sighed, and she sat down to watch their \nchess match, which culminated in an exciting checkmate of Ron\u2019s, \ninvolving a couple of recklessly brave pawns and a very violent \nbishop. \n \nHarry awoke very suddenly on Christmas Day. Wondering what \nhad caused his abrupt return to consciousness, he opened his eyes, \nand saw something with very large, round, green eyes staring back \nat him in the darkness, so close they were almost nose to nose. \n\u201cDobby !\u201d Harry yelled, scrambling away from the elf so fast he \nalmost fell out of bed. \u201cDon\u2019t do that!\u201d \n\u201cDobby is sorry, sir!\u201d squeaked Dobby anxiously, jumping back-\nward with his long fingers over hi s mouth. \u201cDobby is only wanting \nto wish Harry Potter \u2018Merry Christmas\u2019 and bring him a present, \nsir!

There \nwas just no getting arou nd the fact that his robes looked more like \na dress than anything else. In a desperate attempt to make them \nlook more manly, he used a Severing Charm on the ruff and cuffs.

She looked very pretty indeed, in \nrobes of shocking pink, with her lo ng dark plait braided with gold, \nand gold bracelets glimmering at her wrists. Harry was relieved to \nsee that she wasn\u2019t giggling. \n\u201cYou \u2014 er \u2014 look nice,\u201d he said awkwardly. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d she said. \u201cPadma\u2019s goin g to meet you in the entrance \nhall,\u201d she added to Ron. \n\u201cRight,\u201d said Ron, looking around. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hermione?\u201d \nParvati shrugged. \u201cShall we go down then, Harry?\u201d \u201cOkay,\u201d said Harry, wishing he could just stay in the common \nroom.

When they had di sappeared, Ron stood straight \nagain and stared over the heads of the crowd. \n\u201cWhere is Hermione?\u201d he said again. \nA group of Slytherins came up the steps from their dungeon \ncommon room. Malfoy was in front; he was wearing dress robes of \nblack velvet with a high collar, which in Harry\u2019s opinion made him \nlook like a vicar. Pansy Parkinson in very frilly robes of pale pink \nwas clutching Malfoy\u2019s arm. Crab be and Goyle were both wearing \ngreen; they resembled moss-colored boulders, and neither of them, \nHarry was pleased to see, had managed to find a partner. \nThe oak front doors opened, and eve ryone turned to look as the \nDurmstrang students entered with Professor Karkaroff.

His jaw dropped. \nIt was Hermione. \nBut she didn\u2019t look li ke Hermione at all.

Ron, however, walked right past \nHermione without looking at her. \nOnce everyone else was settled in the Hall, Professor McGona-\ngall told the champions and their pa rtners to get in line in pairs and \nto follow her.

It\u2019s the same sort of prejudice that people have toward \nwerewolves. . . . It\u2019s ju st bigotry, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \nRon looked as though he would have liked to reply scathingly, \nbut perhaps he didn\u2019t want another row, because he contented him-\nself with shaking his head disb elievingly while Hermione wasn\u2019t \nlooking. \nIt was time now to think of the homework they had neglected \nduring the first week of the holida ys. Everybody seemed to be feeling \nrather flat now that Christmas was over \u2014 everybody except Harry, that is, who was starting (once again) to feel slightly nervous. \nThe trouble was that February the twenty-fourth looked a lot \ncloser from this side of Christ mas, and he still hadn\u2019t done any-\nthing about working out the clue in side the golden egg. He there-\nfore started taking the egg out of his trunk every time he went up \nto the dormitory, opening it, and listening intently, hoping that this time it would make some sense. He strained to think what the \nsound reminded him of, apart from thirty musical sa ws, but he had \nnever heard anything else like it. He closed the egg, shook it vigor-\nously, and opened it ag ain to see if the soun d had changed, but it \nhadn\u2019t. He tried asking the egg questions, sh outing over all the \nwailing, but nothing happened. He even threw the egg across the \nroom \u2014 though he ha dn\u2019t really expected that to help. \nHarry had not forgotte n the hint that Cedric had given him, but \nhis less-than-friendly feelings toward Cedric just now meant that \nhe was keen not to take his help if he could avoid it .

Nobody was looking forward to Care of \nMagical Creatures much in this weather, though as Ron said, the skrewts would probably warm them up nicely, either by chasing \nthem, or blasting off so forcefull y that Hagrid\u2019s cabin would catch \nfire. \nWhen they arrived at Hagrid\u2019s cabi n, however, they found an el-\nderly witch with closely cropped gray hair and a very prominent \nchin standing before his front door. \n\u201cHurry up, now, the bell rang fi ve minutes ago,\u201d she barked at \nthem as they stru ggled toward her through the snow. \n\u201cWho\u2019re you?\u201d said Ron, starin g at her. \u201cWhere\u2019s Hagrid?\u201d \n\u201cMy name is Professor Grubbly-Pl ank,\u201d she said briskly. \u201cI am \nyour temporary Care of Ma gical Creatures teacher.\u201d \n\u201cWhere\u2019s Hagrid?\u201d Ha rry repeated loudly. \n\u201cHe is indisposed,\u201d said Prof essor Grubbly-Plank shortly. \nSoft and unpleasant laughter re ached Harry\u2019s ears.

He hadn\u2019t me ntioned Viktor Krum since the \nball, but Harry had found a mini ature arm under his bed on Box-\ning Day, which had looked very much as though it had been \nsnapped off a small m odel figure wearing Bulgarian Quidditch \nrobes. \nHarry kept his eyes skinned for a sign of Hagr id all the way \ndown the slushy High Street, and suggested a visi t to the Three \nBroomsticks once he ha d ascertained that Hagr id was not in any of \nthe shops. \nThe pub was as crowded as ever, but one quick look around at \nall the tables told Harr y that Hagrid wasn\u2019t there. Heart sinking, he \nwent up to the bar with Ron an d Hermione, ordered three butter-\nbeers from Madam Rosmerta, and thought gloomily that he might \njust as well have stayed behind an d listened to the egg wailing after \nall. \n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he ever go into the office?\u201d Hermione whispered sud-\ndenly. \u201cLook!\u201d \nShe pointed into the mirror behi nd the bar, and Harry saw Ludo \nBagman reflected there, sitting in a shadowy corner with a bunch \nof goblins. Bagman was talking ve ry fast in a low voice to the \n \nRITA SKEETER\u2019S SCOOP \n\u0091 445 \u0091 goblins, all of whom had their arms crossed and were looking \nrather menacing. \nIt was indeed odd, Harry thought, that Bagman wa s here at the \nThree Broomsticks on a weekend when there was no Triwizard \nevent, and therefore no judging to be done. He watched Bagman \nin the mirror. He was looking strained again, quite as strained as he \nhad that night in the forest before the Dark Mark had appeared. \nBut just then Bagman glanced over at the bar, sa w Harry, and stood \nup. \n\u201cIn a moment, in a moment!\u201d Ha rry heard him say brusquely to \nthe goblins, and Bagman hurried through the pub toward Harry, \nhis boyish grin back in place. \n\u201cHarry!\u201d he said. \u201cHow are you? Been hoping to run into you! \nEverything going all right?\u201d \n\u201cFine, thanks,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cWonder if I could have a quick, private word, Harry?\u201d said Bag-\nman eagerly. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t give us a moment, you two, could you?\u201d \n\u201cEr \u2014 okay,\u201d said Ron, and he and Hermione went off to find a \ntable. \nBagman led Harry along the bar to the end furthest from \nMadam Rosmerta. \n\u201cWell, I just thought I\u2019d congratulate you again on your \nsplendid performance against that Horntail, Harry,\u201d said Bagman. \n\u201cReally superb.\u201d \n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Harry, but he knew this couldn\u2019t be all that Bag-\nman wanted to say, because he could have congratulated Harry in front of Ron and Hermione.

Beat \n\u2019em all.\u201d \nLying to Hagrid wasn\u2019t quite like lying to anyone else. Harry \nwent back to the castle later that afternoon with Ron and Her-\nmione, unable to banish the im age of the happy expression on \nRITA SKEETER\u2019S SCOOP \n\u0091 457 \u0091 Hagrid\u2019s whiskery face as he had imagined Harry winning the tour-\nnament. The incomprehensible e gg weighed more heavily than \never on Harry\u2019s conscience that evening, and by the time he had \ngot into bed, he had ma de up his mind \u2014 it wa s time to shelve his \npride and see if Cedric\u2019s hint was worth anything. \nC H A P T E R T W E N T Y - F I V E \n \n\u0091 458 \u0091 THE EGG AND THE EYE \n \n \n \ns Harry had no idea how long a bath he woul d need to work \nout the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at \nnight, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted. R e l u c t a n t t h o u g h h e w a s t o a c c e p t m o r e f a v o r s f r o m C e d r i c , h e also decided to use the prefects\u2019 bathroom; far fewer people were \nallowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be \ndisturbed. \nHarry planned his ex cursion carefully, be cause he had been \ncaught out of bed and out-of-bound s by Filch the caretaker in the \nmiddle of the night once before, an d had no desire to repeat the \nexperience. The Invisibi lity Cloak would, of course, be essential, \nand as an added precaution, Ha rry thought he would take the \nMarauder\u2019s Map, which, next to th e cloak, was the most useful aid \nto rule-breaking Harry owned. Th e map showed the whole of Hog-\nwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, \nmost important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as A \nTHE EGG AND THE EYE \n\u0091 459 \u0091 minuscule, labeled dots, moving ar ound the corridors, so that Harry \nwould be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom. \nOn Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, \ncrept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when \nHagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to \nopen. This time it was Ron who wait ed outside to give the Fat Lady \nthe password (\u201cbanana fritters \u201d). \u201cGood luck,\u201d Ron muttered, \nclimbing into the room as Harry crept out past him. \nIt was awkward moving under th e cloak tonight, because Harry \nhad the heavy egg under one arm an d the map held in front of his \nnose with the other. However, the moonlit corri dors were empty \nand silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry \nwas able to ensure that he wouldn\u2019t run into anyone he wanted to \navoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-\nlooking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, \u201cPine \nfresh,\u201d just as Cedric had told him. \nThe door creaked open. Harry sl ipped inside, bo lted the door \nbehind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around. \nHis immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a \nprefect just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a \nsplendid candle-filled chandelier , and everything was made of \nwhite marble, including what look ed like an empt y, rectangular \nswimming pool sunk in to the middle of the floor. About a hundred \ngolden taps stood all ar ound the pool\u2019s edges, each with a differ-\nently colored jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a co rner, and there was a single golden-\nframed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who"

It fluttered \nevery time she snored. \nHarry moved forward, looking ar ound, his footsteps echoing off \nthe walls. Magnificent though th e bathroom was \u2014 and quite keen \nthough he was to try out a few of those taps \u2014 now he was here he \ncouldn\u2019t quite suppress the feelin g that Cedric might have been \nhaving him on. How on earth was this suppose d to help solve the \nmystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the fluffy towels, \nthe cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-\nsized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps. \nHe could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble \nbath mixed with the water, though it wasn\u2019t bubble bath as Harry \nhad ever experienced it. One tap gu shed pink and blue bubbles the \nsize of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have su pported his weight if he\u2019d cared to test it; \na third sent heavily perfumed purp le clouds hovering over the sur-\nface of the water. Harry amused him self for a while turning the taps \non and off, particularly enjoyi ng the effect of one whose jet \nbounced off the surface of the wa ter in large arcs. Then, when the \ndeep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a \nvery short time considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps, \npulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into \nthe water. \nIt was so deep that his feet bare ly touched the bottom, and he ac-\ntually did a couple of lengths befo re swimming back to the side and \ntreading water, staring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was \nto swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-colored steam wafting all around him, no stro ke of brilliance came to him, \nno sudden burst of understanding. \nTHE EGG AND THE EYE \n\u0091 461 \u0091 Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and \nopened it. The wailing, screechi ng sound filled the bathroom, \nechoing and reverberating off the ma rble walls, but it sounded just \nas incomprehensible as ever, if no t more so with all the echoes. He \nsnapped it shut again, worried th at the sound would attract Filch, \nwondering whether that hadn\u2019t been Cedric\u2019s plan \u2014 and then, \nmaking him jump so badly that he dropped the eg g, which clat-\ntered away across the bathro om floor, someone spoke. \n\u201cI\u2019d try putting it in the water, if I were you.\u201d \nHarry had swallowed a consider able amount of bubbles in \nshock. He stood up, sputtering, an d saw the ghost of a very glum-\nlooking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was \nMoaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the \nS-bend of a toilet three floors below. \n\u201cMyrtle!\u201d Harry said in outrag e, \u201cI\u2019m \u2014 I\u2019m not wearing \nanything!\u201d \nThe foam was so dense that this hardly mattered, but he had a \nnasty feeling that Myrtle had been spying on him from out of one \nof the taps ever since he had arrived. \n\u201cI closed my eyes when you got in,\u201d she said, blinking at him \nthrough her thick spectacles. \u201cYou haven\u2019t been to see me for ages.\u201d \n\u201cYeah . . . well . . .\u201d said Harry, b ending his knees slightly, just to \nmake absolutely sure Myrtle coul dn\u2019t see anything but his head, \n\u201cI\u2019m not supposed to come into your bathroom, am I? It\u2019s a girls\u2019 \none.\u201d \n\u201cYou didn\u2019t used to care,\u201d said Myrtle miserably. \u201cYou used to be \nin there all the time.\u201d \nThis was true, though only be cause Harry, Ron, and Hermione \nhad found Myrtle\u2019s out-of-order to ilets a convenient place to brew"

Hermione squashed this plan by pointing out that, in the un-\nlikely event that Harry managed to learn how to operate an Aqua-\nLung within the set limit of an hour, he was sure to be disqualified \nfor breaking the International Code of Wizarding Secrecy \u2014 it was \nt o o m u c h t o h o p e t h a t n o M u g g l e s w o u l d s p o t a n A q u a - L u n g \nzooming across the countryside to Hogwarts. \n\u201cOf course, the ideal solution would be for you to Transfigure \nyourself into a submarine or some thing,\u201d Hermione said. \u201cIf only \nwe\u2019d done human Transfiguration already! But I don\u2019t think we \nstart that until sixth year, and it can go badly wrong if you don\u2019t \nknow what you\u2019re doing. . . .\u201d \n\u201cYeah, I don\u2019t fancy walking arou nd with a periscope sticking \nout of my head,\u201d said Harry. \u201cI s\u2019pose I could always attack some-\none in front of M oody; he might do it for me. . . .\u201d \n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019d let you choose what you wanted to be turned \ninto, though,\u201d said Hermione seriously. \u201cNo, I think your best chance is some sort of charm.\u201d \nSo Harry, thinking that he woul d soon have had enough of the \nlibrary to last him a lifetime, buried himself once more among \nthe dusty volumes, looking for any spell that might enable a hu-\nman to survive without oxygen. However, though he, Ron, and \nHermione searched through their lunchtimes, evenings, and whole \nweekends \u2014 though Harry asked Pr ofessor McGonagall for a note \nof permission to use the Restricted Section, and even asked the ir-ritable, vulture-like librarian, Madam Pince, for help \u2014 they \nfound nothing whatsoever that would enable Harry to spend an \nhour underwater and live to tell the tale. \nFamiliar flutterings of panic were starting to disturb Harry now, \nTHE SECOND TASK \n\u0091 483 \u0091 and he was finding it difficult to concentrate in class again. The \nlake, which Harry had always taken for granted as just another fea-\nture of the grounds, drew his ey es whenever he was near a class-\nroom window, a great, iron-gray ma ss of chilly wa ter, whose dark \nand icy depths were starting to seem as distant as the moon. \nJ u s t a s i t h a d b e f o r e h e f a c e d the Horntail, time was slipping \naway as though somebody had bewitched the clocks to go extra-fast. There was a week to go be fore February the twenty-fourth \n(there was still time) . . . there were five days to go (he was bound \nto find something soon) . . . three days to go ( please let me find \nsomething . . . please ) . . . \nWith two days left, Harry started to go off food again. The only \ngood thing about breakf ast on Monday was the return of the \nbrown owl he had sent to Sirius. He pulled off the parchment, \nunrolled it, and saw the shortest letter Sirius had ever written to \nhim. \n \nSend date of next Hogsme ade weekend by return owl. \n \nHarry turned the parc hment over and looked at the back, hop-\ning to see something else, but it was blank. \n\u201cWeekend after next,\u201d whispered Hermione, who had read the \nnote over Harry\u2019s shoulder. \u201cHere \u2014 take my quill and send this \nowl back straight away.\u201d \nHarry scribbled the dates down on th e back of Sirius\u2019s letter, tied \nit onto the brown owl\u2019s leg, and wa tched it take flight again. What \nhad he expected? Advice on how to survive underwater? He had \nbeen so intent on telling Sirius all about Snape and Moody he had \ncompletely forgotten to mention the egg\u2019s clue."

I\u2019m no t worried at all. Yeh\u2019re goin\u2019 ter \nbe fine. Got yer clue worked out, haven\u2019 yeh?\u201d \nHarry nodded, but even as he did so, an insane urge to confess \nthat he didn\u2019t have any idea ho w to survive at the bottom of the \nlake for an hour came over him. He looked up at Hagrid \u2014 per-\nhaps he had to go into the lake sometimes, to deal with the crea-\ntures in it? He looked after everything else on the grounds, after all \u2014 \n\u201cYeh\u2019re goin\u2019 ter win,\u201d Hagrid growled, patting Harry\u2019s shoulder \nagain, so that Harry actually felt himself sink a co uple of inches \ninto the soft ground. \u201cI know it. I can feel it. Yeh\u2019re goin\u2019 ter win, \nHarry. \u201d \nHarry just couldn\u2019t bring himself to wipe the happy, confident \nsmile off Hagrid\u2019s face.

Waiting for them, its front paws \non the topmost bar, was a very large, shaggy black dog, which \nwas carrying some newspapers in its mouth and looking very \nfamiliar. . . . \n\u201cHello, Sirius,\u201d said Harry when they had reached him. \nThe black dog sniffed Harry\u2019s bag eagerly, wagged its tail once, \nthen turned and began to trot away from them across the scrubby \npatch of ground that rose to meet the rocky foot of the mountain. \nHarry, Ron, and Hermione climbe d over the stile and followed. \nSirius led them to the very foot of the mountain, where the \nground was covered with boulders and rocks. It was easy for him, \nwith his four paws, but Harry, Ron, and Hermione were soon out \nof breath. They followed Sirius hi gher, up onto the mountain itself. \nFor nearly half an hour they climbed a steep, winding, and stony \n \nPADFOOT RETURNS \n\u0091 521 \u0091 path, following Sirius\u2019s wagging tail , sweating in the sun, the shoul-\nder straps of Harry\u2019s bag cu tting into his shoulders. \nThen, at last, Sirius slipped out of sight, and when they reached \nthe place where he had vanished, they saw a narrow fissure in the \nrock. They squeezed into it and found themselves in a cool, dimly \nlit cave. Tethered at the end of it, one end of his rope around a large \nrock, was Buckbeak the hippogriff. Half gray horse, half giant ea-\ngle, Buckbeak\u2019s fierce orange eye flashed at the si ght of them. All \nthree of them bowed low to him, and after regarding them imperi-\nously for a moment, Buckbeak bent his scaly front knees and al-\nlowed Hermione to rush forward and stroke his feathery neck. Harry, however, was looking at the black dog, which had just \nturned into his godfather. \nSirius was wearing ragged gray robes; the sa me ones he had been \nwearing when he had left Azkaban. His black hair was longer than it had been when he had appeared in the fire, and it was untidy and \nmatted once more. He looked very thin. \n\u201cChicken!\u201d he said hoarsely after removing the old Daily Prophets \nfrom his mouth and throwing th em down onto the cave floor. \nHarry pulled open his bag and handed over the bundle of \nchicken legs and bread. \n\u201cThanks,\u201d said Sirius, opening it , grabbing a drum stick, sitting \ndown on the cave floor, and tearing off a large chunk with his teeth. \n\u201cI\u2019ve been living off rats mostly .

He takes his Defense Agai nst the Dark Arts seriously, \nMoody. I\u2019m not sure he trusts anyone at all, and after the things he\u2019s \nseen, it\u2019s not surprising. I\u2019ll sa y this for Moody, though, he never \nkilled if he could help it. Always brought peop le in alive where pos-\nsible. He was tough, but he never descended to the level of the \nDeath Eaters. Crouch, though . . . he \u2019s a different ma tter . . . is he \nreally ill? If he is, why did he make the effort to drag himself up to \nSnape\u2019s office? And if he\u2019s not . . . what\u2019s he up to? What was he \ndoing at the World Cup th at was so important he didn\u2019t turn up in \nthe Top Box? What\u2019s he been doing while he should have been \njudging the tournament?\u201d \nSirius lapsed into silence, still staring at the cave wall. Buckbeak \nwas ferreting around on the rocky floor, looking for bones he might have overlooked. Finally, Si rius looked up at Ron. \n\u201cYou say your brother\u2019s Crouch\u2019s personal assistant?

Well, \nmaybe she\u2019s changed since I knew her, but the Bertha I knew wasn\u2019t \nforgetful at all \u2014 quite the reverse. She was a bit dim, but she had an excellent memory for gossip. It used to get her into a lot of trou-\nble; she never knew when to keep her mouth shut. I can see her \nbeing a bit of a liability at the Ministry of Magic . . . maybe that\u2019s why Bagman didn\u2019t bother to look for her for so long. . . .\u201d \nSirius heaved an enormous sigh and rubbed his shadowed eyes. \n\u201cWhat\u2019s the time?\u201d \nHarry checked his watch, then reme mbered it hadn\u2019t been work-\ning since it had spent over an hour in the lake. \n\u201cIt\u2019s half past three,\u201d said Hermione. \n\u201cYou\u2019d better get back to school,\u201d Sirius said, getting to his feet. \n\u201c N o w l i s t e n . . . \u201d H e l o o k e d p a r t i c u l a r l y h a r d a t H a r r y . \u201c I d o n \u2019 t \nwant you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right?

All \nthree of them were so tired they could happily have put their heads \ndown on the desks and slept; even Hermione wasn \u2019t taking her \nusual notes, but was sitting with her head on her hand, gazing at \nProfessor Binns with her eyes out of focus. \nWhen the bell finally rang, they hurried out into the corridors \ntoward the Dark Arts classroom and found Professor Moody leav-\ning it. He looked as tired as they felt. The eyelid of his normal eye \nwas drooping, giving his face an even more lopsided appearance \nthan usual. \n\u201cProfessor Moody?\u201d Harry called as they made their way toward \nhim through the crowd. \n\u201cHello, Potter,\u201d growled Moody . His magical eye followed a \ncouple of passing firs t years, who sped up, looking nervous; it \nrolled into the back of Moody\u2019s he ad and watched them around the \ncorner before he spoke again."

After \na minute or so, Harry heard th e clunks of Moody\u2019s wooden leg \ngrowing fainter in th e corridor below. He looked around. \n\u201cHello, Fawkes,\u201d he said. \nFawkes, Professor Dumbledore\u2019s phoenix, was standing on his \ngolden perch beside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent \nscarlet-and-gold plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked \nbenignly at Harry. \nHarry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore\u2019s desk. For \nseveral minutes, he sat and watc hed the old headma sters and head-\nmistresses snoozing in their fram es, thinking abou t what he had \njust heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped \nhurting now. \nHe felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumble-\ndore\u2019s office, knowing he would sh ortly be telling him about the \ndream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to \nit held a magnificent silver sword wi th large rubies set into the hilt, \nTHE PENSIEVE \n\u0091 583 \u0091 which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the \nSorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to \nGodric Gryffindor, founder of Harry\u2019s House. He was gazing at it, \nremembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all \nhope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silv er-white shining brightly from \nwithin a black cabine t behind him, whos e door had not been \nclosed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, \nwalked across the of fice, and pulled op en the cabinet door. \nA shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the \nedge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery \nlight was coming from the basin\u2019s contents, which were like noth-\ning Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the sub-stance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was \nmoving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water be-\nneath wind, and then, like clouds , separated and swirled smoothly. \nIt looked like light made liquid \u2014 or like wind made solid \u2014 \nHarry couldn\u2019t make up his mind. \nHe wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly \nfour years\u2019 experience of the magi cal world told him that sticking \nhis hand into a bowl full of so me unknown substance was a very \nstupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wa nd out of the inside \nof his ro bes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at \nthe contents of the ba sin, and prodded them. \nThe surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl \nvery fast. \nHarry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery \nsubstance had become tran sparent; it looked li ke glass. He looked"

Lowering \nhis face so that his no se was a mere inch away from the glassy sub-\nstance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witc hes and wizards were \nseated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in \nlevels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There \nwas something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. \nChains encircled the arms of it, as though its oc cupants were usu-\nally tied to it. \nWhere was this place? It surely wasn\u2019t Hogwarts; he had never \nseen a room like that here in th e castle. Moreover, the crowd in the \nmysterious room at the bottom of the basin wa s comprised of \nadults, and Harry knew there were no t nearly that ma ny teachers at \nHogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; \neven though he could on ly see the tops of th eir hats, all of their \nf a c e s s e e m e d t o b e p o i n t i n g i n o n e d i r e c t i o n , a n d n o n e o f t h e m \nwere talking to one another. \nThe basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, \nHarry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it. \nHe leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see . . . \nThe tip of his nose touched the strange substance into which he \nwas staring. \nDumbledore\u2019s office gave an almighty lurch \u2014 Harry was \n \nTHE PENSIEVE \n\u0091 585 \u0091 thrown forward and pitched headfirs t into the substance inside the \nbasin \u2014 \nBut his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling \nthrough something icy-cold and bl ack; it was like being sucked \ninto a dark whirlpool \u2014 \nAnd suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end \nof the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. \nHe looked up at the high stone ce iling, expecting to see the circu-\nlar window through which he had just been staring, but there was nothing there but da rk, solid stone. \nBreathing hard and fast, Harry l ooked around him. Not one of \nthe witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking at him. Not one of them seemed to \nhave noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just dropped from \nthe ceiling into their midst. Harry tu rned to the wizard next to him \non the bench and uttered a loud c ry of surprise that reverberated \naround the silent room. \nHe was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore. \n\u201cProfessor!\u201d Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. \u201cI\u2019m \nsorry \u2014 I didn\u2019t mean to \u2014 I was ju st looking at that basin in your \ncabinet \u2014 I \u2014 where are we?\u201d \nBut Dumbledore didn\u2019t move or speak. He ignored Harry com-\npletely. Like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into \nthe far corner of the ro om, where there was a door. \nHarry gazed, nonplussed, at Du mbledore, then around at the \nsilently watchful crowd, then back at Dumbledore.

That time, he had fallen through a page in \nan enchanted diary, right into so mebody else\u2019s memory . . . and \nunless he was very much mistaken, something of the sort had hap-\npened again. . . . \nHarry raised his right hand, hesi tated, and then waved it ener-\ngetically in front of Dumbledore\u2019 s face. Dumbledore did not blink, \nlook around at Harry, or indeed move at all. And that, in Harry\u2019s \nopinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn\u2019t ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, an d this was not the present-day \nDumbledore. Yet it couldn\u2019t be th at long ago . . . the Dumbledore \nsitting next to him now was silver-h aired, just like the present-day \nDumbledore. But what was this plac e? What were all these wizards \nwaiting for? \nHarry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had sus-\npected when observing it from ab ove, was almost certainly under-\nground \u2014 more of a dungeon than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and forbidding air about th e place; there were no pictures \non the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of \nbenches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that \nthey had a clear view of that ch air with the chains on its arms. \nBefore Harry could reach any co nclusions about the place in \nwhich they were, he heard footstep s. The door in the corner of the \ndungeon opened and three people ent ered \u2014 or at least one man, \nflanked by two dementors. \nHarry\u2019s insides went cold. The de mentors \u2014 tall, hooded crea-\ntures whose faces were concealed \u2014 were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man\u2019s arms with their dead and rotten- looking hands. The man between \nthem looked as though he was ab out to faint, and Harry couldn\u2019t \nTHE PENSIEVE \n\u0091 587 \u0091 blame him . . . he knew the deme ntors could not touch him inside \na memory, but he remembered their power only too well. The \nwatching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man \nin the chained chair and glided back out of the room. The door \nswung shut behind them. \nHarry looked down at the man now sitting in the chair and saw \nthat it was Karkaroff. \nUnlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff l ooked much younger; his hair \nand goatee were black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin \nand ragged robes. He was shaking. Even as Harry watched, the \nchains on the arms of the chair glowed suddenly gold and snaked \ntheir way up Karkaroff\u2019s arms, binding him there. \n\u201cIgor Karkaroff,\u201d said a curt vo ice to Harry\u2019s left. Harry looked \naround and saw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the \nbench beside him. Crouch\u2019s hair was dark, his face was much less \nlined, he looked fit an d alert. \u201cYou have b een brought from Azka-\nban to present evidence to the Mi nistry of Magic. You have given \nus to understand that you have important information for us.\u201d \nKarkaroff straightened himself as best he could, tightly bound to \nthe chair. \n\u201cI have, sir,\u201d he said, and alth ough his voice was very scared, \nHarry could still hear the familiar unctuous note in it. \u201cI wish to be \nof use to the Ministry. I wish to help. I \u2014 I know that the Ministry \nis trying to \u2014 to round up the last of the Dark Lord\u2019s supporters. I am eager to assist in any way I can. . . .\u201d \nThere was a murmur around the benches. Some of the wizards \nand witches were surveying Karkaroff with interest, others with pronounced mistrust. Then Harry heard, quite distinctly, from \nDumbledore\u2019s other side, a familiar, growling voice saying, \u201cFilth.\u201d"

One of his names was worthless. \n\u201cAny others?\u201d said Crouch coldly. \u201cWhy, yes . . . there was Rosier,\u201d said Karkaroff hurriedly. \u201cEvan \nRosier.\u201d \n\u201cRosier is dead,\u201d said Crouch. \u201cHe was caught sh ortly after you \nwere too. He preferred to fight rather than come quietly and was \nkilled in the struggle.\u201d \n\u201cTook a bit of me with him, though,\u201d whispered Moody to \nHarry\u2019s right.

Six dementors entered \nthis time, flanking a group of fo ur people. Harry saw the people in \nthe crowd turn to look up at Mr . Crouch. A few of them whispered \nto one another. \nThe dementors placed each of the four people in the four chairs \nwith chained arms that now stood on the dungeon fl oor. There was \na thickset man who stared blankl y up at Crouch; a thinner and \nmore nervous-looking man, whose eyes were darting around the \ncrowd; a woman with thick, shinin g dark hair and heavily hooded \neyes, who was sitting in the chai ned chair as though it were a \nthrone; and a boy in his late teens, who looked nothing short of \npetrified.

The contents had re-\nturned to their original, silvery- white state, swirling and rippling \nbeneath his gaze. \n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d Harry asked shakily. \u201cThis?

And \nWinky too, remember . . . \u2018Ludo Bagman\u2019s a bad wizard.\u2019 Mr. \nCrouch would have been furious he got off, he would have talked \nabout it at home.\u201d \n\u201cYeah, but Bagman didn\u2019t pass information on purpose, did he?\u201d Hermione shrugged. \u201cAnd Fudge reckons Madame Maxime attacked Crouch?\u201d Ron \nsaid, turning back to Harry. \n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, \u201cbut he\u2019s on ly saying that because Crouch \ndisappeared near the Beauxbatons carriage.\u201d \n\u201cWe never thought of her, did we?\u201d said Ron slowly. \u201cMind \nyou, she\u2019s definitely got giant bloo d, and she doesn\u2019t want to admit \nit \u2014\u201d \n\u201cOf course she doesn\u2019t,\u201d said Hermione sharply, looking up. \n\u201c L o o k w h a t h a p p e n e d t o H a g r i d when Rita found out about his \nmother. Look at Fudge, jumping to conclusions about her, just be-\ncause she\u2019s part giant. Who needs that sort of prejudice? I\u2019d proba-\nbly say I had big bones if I knew that\u2019s what I\u2019d get for telling the truth.\u201d \nTHE THIRD TASK \n\u0091 607 \u0091 Hermione looked at her watch. \u201cWe haven\u2019t done any practic-\ning!\u201d she said, looking shocked. \u201cWe were going to do the Impedi-\nment Curse! We\u2019ll have to really get down to it tomorrow! Come \non, Harry, you need to get some sleep.\u201d \nHarry and Ron went slowly upst airs to their dormitory. As \nHarry pulled on his pajamas, he l ooked over at Neville\u2019s bed. True \nto his word to Dumbledore, he had not told Ron and Hermione \nabout Neville\u2019s parents. As Harry took off his glasses and climbed \ninto his four-poster, he imagined how it must feel to have parents \nstill living but unable to recogn ize you. He often got sympathy \nfrom strangers for being an orphan, but as he listen ed to Neville\u2019s \nsnores, he thought that Neville deserved it more than he did. Lying \nin the darkness, Harry felt a rush of anger and hate toward the peo-\nple who had tortured Mr. and Mr s. Longbottom. . . . He remem-\nbered the jeers of the crowd as Crouch\u2019s son and his companions \nhad been dragged from the court by the dementors. . . . He under-\nstood how they had felt . . . . Then he reme mbered the milk-white \nface of the screaming boy and realized with a jolt that he had died \na year later. . . . \nIt was Voldemort, Harry thought, staring up at the canopy of his \nbed in the darkness, it all came back to Voldemort. . . . He was the \none who had torn these families apart, who had ruined all these \nlives. . . . \n \nRon and Hermione were supposed to be studying for their exams, \nwhich would finish on the day of the third task, but they were \nputting most of their efforts into helping Harry prepare. \n\u201cDon\u2019t worry about it,\u201d Hermio ne said shortly when Harry \npointed this out to them and said he didn\u2019t mind practicing on his"

We\u2019d never have found out about all these hexes in \nclass.\u201d \n\u201cGood training for when we\u2019re all Aurors,\u201d said Ron excitedly, \nattempting the Impediment Curse on a wasp that had buzzed into \nthe room and making it stop dead in midair. \nThe mood in the castle as they entered June became excited and \ntense again. Everyone was looking forward to the third task, which \nwould take place a week before the end of term. Harry was practic-\ning hexes at every available mome nt. He felt more confident about \nthis task than either of the others. Difficul t and dangerous though \nit would undoubtedly be, Moody was right: Harry had managed to \nfind his way past monstrous crea tures and enchanted barriers be-\nfore now, and this time he had some notice, some chance to pre-\npare himself for what lay ahead. \nTired of walking in on Harry, Hermione, and Ron all over the \nschool, Professor McGonagall had given them permission to use \nthe empty Transfiguration classr oom at lunchtimes. Harry had \nsoon mastered the Impediment Curse, a spell to slow down and ob-\nstruct attackers; the Reductor Curse, which would enable him to \nblast solid objects out of his way; and the Four-Point Spell, a useful \ndiscovery of Hermione\u2019s that would make his wand point due \nnorth, therefore enabling him to check whether he was going in the \nright direction within the maze. He was still having trouble with \nthe Shield Charm, though. This was supposed to cast a temporary, \ninvisible wall around himself th at deflected minor curses; Hermi-\none managed to shatter it with a well-placed Jelly-Legs Jinx, and \nHarry wobbled around the room fo r ten minutes afterward before \nshe had looked up the counter-jinx. \nTHE THIRD TASK \n\u0091 609 \u0091 \u201cYou\u2019re still doing really well, though,\u201d Hermione said encour-\nagingly, looking down her list and cr ossing off those spells they had \nalready learned. \u201cSom e of these are bound to come in handy.\u201d \n\u201cCome and look at this,\u201d said Ron, who was standing by the \nwindow. He was staring down onto the grounds. \u201cWhat\u2019s Malfoy \ndoing?\u201d \nHarry and Hermione went to see. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle were \nstanding in the shadow of a tree be low. Crabbe and Goyle seemed to \nbe keeping a lookout; both were smirking. Malfoy was holding his \nhand up to his mouth and speaking into it. \n\u201cHe looks like he\u2019s using a walki e-talkie,\u201d said Harry curiously. \n\u201cHe can\u2019t be,\u201d said Hermione, \u201cI \u2019ve told you, those sorts of \nthings don\u2019t work around Hogwarts. Come on, Harry,\u201d she added \nbriskly, turning away from the wi ndow and moving back into the \nmiddle of the room, \u201clet\u2019s t ry that Shield Charm again.\u201d \n \nSirius was sending daily owls now. Like Hermione, he seemed to \nwant to concentrate on getting Ha rry through the last task before \nthey concerned themselves with anything else. He reminded Harry \nin every letter that whatever migh t be going on outs ide the walls of \nHogwarts was not Harry\u2019s responsi bility, nor was it within his \npower to influence it. \n \nIf Voldemort is really getting stronger again , he wrote, my \npriority is to ensure your safety. He cannot hope to lay hands \non you while you are under Dumbledore\u2019s protection, but all \nthe same, take no risks : Concentrate on getting through that \nmaze safely, and then we can turn our attention to other \nmatters."

A twenty- foot-high hedge ran all the way \naround the edge of it. There was a gap right in front of them: the \nentrance to the vast maze.

Still, \nthere was nothing in sight. \nBagman\u2019s whistle blew in the dist ance for the third time. All of \nthe champions were now inside. \nHarry kept looking behind him.

Harry didn\u2019t \nknow why, but the lack of obst acles was unnerving him. Surely he \nshould have met something by now? It felt as though the maze were \nluring him into a false sense of security.

Then, as he turned a corner, he saw . . . a dementor gliding toward him. Twelve feet tall, its face hidden by its \n \nTHE THIRD TASK \n\u0091 623 \u0091 hood, its rotting, scabbed hands ou tstretched, it advanced, sensing \nits way blindly toward him. Harry could hear its rattling breath; he \nfelt clammy coldness stealing over him, but knew what he had to \ndo. . . . \nHe summoned the happiest thought he could, concentrated \nwith all his might on the thought of getting out of the maze and celebrating with Ron and Hermione, raised his wand, and cried, \n\u201cExpecto Patronum !\u201d \nA silver stag erupted from the end of Harry\u2019s wand and galloped \ntoward the dementor, which fell ba ck and tripped over the hem of \nits robes. . . .

The use of an Unforgiv able Curse on a fellow human be-\ning meant a life term in Azkaban, that was what Moody had told \nthem. Krum surely coul dn\u2019t have wanted the Triwizard Cup that \nbadly. . . .

It had the body of an over-lar ge lion: great clawed \npaws and a long yellowish tail end ing in a brown tuft. Its head, how-\never, was that of a woman. She tu rned her long, almond-shaped eyes \nupon Harry as he approached. He raised his wand, hesitating.

He weighed his chances. If \nthe riddle was too hard, he could keep silent, get away from the \nsphinx unharmed, and try and find an alternative route to the center. \n\u201cOkay,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I hear the riddle?\u201d \nThe sphinx sat down upon her hind legs, in the very middle of \nthe path, and recited: \n \n\u201cFirst think of the person who lives in disguise, \nWho deals in secrets and tells naught but lies. \nNext, tell me what\u2019s always the last thing to mend, \nThe middle of middle and end of the end ? \nAnd finally give me the sound often heard \nDuring the search for a hard-to-find word.

He was walking away from the \nsort of glory Hufflepuff Hous e hadn\u2019t had in centuries. \n\u201cGo on,\u201d Cedric said. He looked as though this was costing him \nevery ounce of resolution he had, but his face was set, his arms were \nfolded, he seemed decided. \nHarry looked from Cedric to th e cup. For one shining moment, \nhe saw himself emerging from the maze, holding it. He saw himself \nholding the Triwizard Cup aloft, he ard the roar of the crowd, saw \nCho\u2019s face shining with admiration , more clearly than he had ever \nseen it before . . . and then the picture faded, and he found himself staring at Cedric\u2019s shadowy, stubborn face. \n\u201cBoth of us,\u201d Harry said. \u201cWhat?\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ll take it at the same time.

He raised his head. \n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d he said. Cedric shook his head. He got up, pulled Harry to his feet, and \nthey looked around. \nThey had left the Hogwarts grou nds completely; they had obvi-\nously traveled miles \u2014 perhaps hu ndreds of miles \u2014 for even the \nmountains surrounding the castle were gone. They were standing instead in a dark and overgrown graveyard; th e black outline of a \nsmall church was visible beyond a large yew tree to their right. A \nhill rose above them to their left . Harry could just make out the \noutline of a fine old house on the hillside. \nCedric looked down at the Triwiz ard Cup and then up at Harry. \n\u201cDid anyone tell you the cup was a Portkey?\u201d he asked. \n H \nFLESH, BLOOD, AND BONE \n\u0091 637 \u0091 \u201cNope,\u201d said Harry. He was looking around the graveyard. It \nwas completely silent and slightly eerie. \u201cIs this supposed to be part \nof the task?\u201d \n\u201cI dunno,\u201d said Cedric. He so unded slightly nervous. \u201cWands \nout, d\u2019you reckon?\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, glad that Ce dric had made the suggestion \nrather than him. \nThey pulled out their wands. Harry kept looking around him. \nH e h a d , y e t a g a i n , the strange feeling that they were being \nwatched. \n\u201cSomeone\u2019s coming,\u201d he said suddenly.

Harry couldn\u2019t make out a face, bu t from the way it was walking \nand holding its arms, he could tell that it was carrying something. Whoever it was, he was short, and wearing a hooded cloak pulled \nup over his head to obscure his face.

They both turned back to watch \nthe approaching figure. \nIt stopped beside a to wering marble headstone, only six feet \nfrom them. For a second, Harry an d Cedric and the short figure \nsimply looked at one another. \nAnd then, without warning, Harry\u2019 s scar exploded with pain.

Now Worm-\ntail was busying himself at the bottom of the cauldron with a \nwand. Suddenly there were crackling flames beneath it. The large \nsnake slithered away into the darkness. \nThe liquid in the cauldron seemed to heat very fast. The surface \nbegan not only to bubble, but to send out fiery sparks, as though it \nwere on fire. Steam was thickening , blurring the outline of Worm-\ntail tending the fire.

His breathing harsh and \nragged, he raised his head and stared in disbelief at the silver \nhand, now attached seamlessly to his arm, as though he were \nwearing a dazzling glove. He flex ed the shining fingers, then, \ntrembling, picked up a small twig on the ground and crushed it \ninto powder. \n\u201cMy Lord,\u201d he whispered. \u201cMaster . . . it is beautiful . . . thank \nyou . . . thank you. . . .\u201d \nHe scrambled forward on his k nees and kissed the hem of Volde-\nmort\u2019s robes."

She told me th at she knew of a faithful Death \nEater who would be only too willing to help me, if I could only \ncontact him. She told me many things . . . but the means I used to break the Memory Charm upon he r were powerful, and when I \nhad extracted all useful information from her, her mind and body \nwere both damaged beyond repair.

I did. Who fright ened off every person I thought \nmight try to hurt you or prevent you from winning the tourna-\nment? I did. Who nudged Hagrid into showing you the dragons? I \ndid. Who helped you see the only way you could beat the dragon? \nI did. \u201d \nMoody\u2019s magical eye had now left the door. It was fixed upon \nHarry. His lopsided mouth leer ed more widely than ever. \n\u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy, Harry, gu iding you through these tasks \nwithout arousing suspicion. I have had to use every ounce of cun-ning I possess, so that my hand would not be detectable in your \nsuccess. Dumbledore would have be en very suspicious if you had \nmanaged everything too easily. As long as you got into that maze, \npreferably with a decent head start \u2014 then, I knew, I would have a \nchance of getting rid of the other champions and leaving your way \nclear. But I also had to contend with your stupidity. The second \ntask . . . that was when I was most afraid we would fail. I was keep-\ning watch on you, Potter. I knew you hadn\u2019t worked out the egg\u2019s \nclue, so I had to give you another hint \u2014\u201d \n\u201cYou didn\u2019t,\u201d Harry said hoarsely . \u201cCedric gave me the clue \u2014\u201d \n\u201cWho told Cedric to open it underwater? I did. I trusted that he \nwould pass the information on to you. Decent people are so easy \nto manipulate, Potter. I was sure Cedric would want to repay you \nfor telling him about the dragons, and so he did. But even then, \nVERITASER U M \n\u0091 677 \u0091 Potter, even then you seemed likely to fail. I was watching all the \ntime . . . all those hours in the library. Didn\u2019t you realize that the \nbook you needed was in your dormitory all along? I planted it there early on, I gave it to the Long bottom boy, don\u2019t you remember? \nMagical Water Plants of the Mediterranean. It would have told you \nall you needed to know about gi llyweed. I expected you to ask \neveryone and anyone you could fo r help. Longbottom would have \ntold you in an instant. But you di d not . . . you did not. . . . You \nhave a streak of pride and independ ence that might ha ve ruined all. \n\u201cSo what could I do? Feed you information from another inno-\ncent source. You told me at the Yule Ball a house-elf called Dobby \nhad given you a Christmas present. I called the elf to the staffroom \nto collect some robes for cleaning . I staged a loud conversation \nwith Professor McGonagall about the hostages who had been taken, and whether Potter would t hink to use gillyweed. And your \nlittle elf friend ran straight to Sn ape\u2019s office and then hurried to \nfind you. . . .\u201d \nMoody\u2019s wand was still pointing directly at Harry\u2019s heart. Over \nhis shoulder, foggy shapes were moving in the Foe-Glass on the \nwall. \n\u201cYou were so long in that lake, Potter, I thought you had \ndrowned. But luckily, Dumbledore took your idiocy for nobility, and marked you high for it. I breathed again. \n\u201cYou had an easier time of it than you should have in that maze \ntonight, of course,\u201d said Moody. \u201cI was patrolling around it, able to \nsee through the outer hedges, able to curse many obstacles out of \nyour way. I Stunned Fleur Delacour as she passed. I put the Im-\nperius Curse on Krum, so that he would finish Diggory and leave \nyour path to the cup clear.\u201d"

He just didn\u2019t see how this could be. . . . \nDumbledore\u2019s friend, the famous Auror . . . the one who had \ncaught so many Death Eaters . . . It made no sense . . . no sense at \nall. . . . \nThe foggy shapes in the Foe-Glass were sharpening, had become \nmore distinct. Harry could see the outlines of three people over \nMoody\u2019s shoulder, moving closer and closer. But Moody wasn\u2019t \nwatching them. His magical eye was upon Harry. \n\u201c T h e D a r k L o r d d i d n \u2019 t m a n a g e t o k i l l y o u , P o t t e r , a n d h e so \nwanted to,\u201d whispered Moody. \u201cI magine how he will reward me \nwhen he finds I have done it fo r h i m .

I will be his \ndearest, his closest supporter . . . closer than a son. . . .\u201d \nMoody\u2019s normal eye was bulging, the magical eye fixed upon \nHarry. The door was barred, and Ha rry knew he would never reach \nhis own wand in time. . . . \n\u201cThe Dark Lord and I,\u201d said Mo ody, and he looked completely \ninsane now, towering over Harry, leering down at him, \u201chave much \nin common. Both of us, for in stance, had very disappointing \nfathers . . . very disappointing indeed. Both of us suffered the in-\ndignity, Harry, of being named after those fathers. And both of us \nhad the pleasure . . . the very gr eat pleasure . . . of killing our \nfathers to ensure the continue d rise of the Dark Order!\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d Harry said \u2014 he co uldn\u2019t stop himself \u2014 \u201cyou\u2019re \nmad!\u201d \n\u201cMad, am I?\u201d said Moody, his voic e rising uncontrollably. \u201cWe\u2019ll \nsee! We\u2019ll see who\u2019s mad, now that the Dark Lord has returned, \nVERITASER U M \n\u0091 679 \u0091 with me at his side! He is back, Harry Potter , you did not conquer \nhim \u2014 and now \u2014 I conquer you!\u201d \nMoody raised his wand, he open ed his mouth; Harry plunged \nhis own hand into his robes \u2014 \n\u201cStupefy !\u201d There was a blinding flas h of red light, and with a \ngreat splintering and crashing, the door of Moody\u2019s office was \nblasted apart \u2014 \nMoody was thrown backward onto the office floor. Harry, still \nstaring at the place where Moody\u2019s face had been, saw Albus Dum-\nbledore, Professor Snape, and Pr ofessor McGonagall looking back \nat him out of the Foe- Glass. He looked arou nd and saw the three \nof them standing in the doorway, Dumbledore in front, his wand \noutstretched. \nAt that moment, Harry fully un derstood for the first time why \npeople said Dumbledore was the on ly wizard Voldemort had ever \nfeared. The look upon Dumbledore\u2019s face as he stared down at the \nunconscious form of Mad-Eye Moody was more terrible than \nHarry could have ever imagined. Th ere was no benign smile upon \nDumbledore\u2019s face, no twinkle in the eyes behind the spectacles. \nThere was cold fury in every line of the ancient face; a sense of \npower radiated from Dumbledore as t h o u g h h e w e r e g i v i n g o f f \nburning heat. \nHe stepped into the office, plac ed a foot underneath Moody\u2019s \nunconscious body, and kicked him over onto his back, so that his \nface was visible. Snape followed hi m, looking into the Foe-Glass, \nwhere his own face was still visible, glaring into the room.

Both turned at once and left the office. \nDumbledore walked over to the trun k with seven locks, fitted the \nVERITASER U M \n\u0091 681 \u0091 first key in the lock, and opened it . It contained a mass of spell-\nbooks. Dumbledore closed the trun k, placed a second key in the \nsecond lock, and opened the trun k again. The sp ellbooks had van-\nished; this time it contained an a s s o r t m e n t o f b r o k e n S n e a k o -\nscopes, some parchment and quills, and what looked like a silvery \nInvisibility Cloak. Harry watc hed, astounded, as Dumbledore \nplaced the third, fourth, fifth, an d sixth keys in their respective \nlocks, reopening the trunk, and ea ch time revealin g different con-\ntents. Then he placed the seventh key in the lock, threw open the \nlid, and Harry let out a cry of amazement. \nHe was looking down into a kind of pit, an underground room, \nand lying on the floor some ten feet below, apparently fast asleep, \nthin and starved in appearance, was the real Mad-Eye Moody. His \nwooden leg was gone, the socket that should have held the magical \neye looked empty beneath its lid, and chunks of his grizzled hair \nwere missing. Harry stared, thunde rstruck, between the sleeping \nMoody in the trunk and the uncons cious Moody lying on the floor \nof the office. \nDumbledore climbed into the trunk, lowered himself, and fell \nlightly onto the floor beside the sleeping Moody. He bent over \nhim. \n\u201cStunned \u2014 controlled by the Imperius Curse \u2014 very weak,\u201d \nhe said. \u201cOf course, they would have needed to keep him alive. \nHarry, throw down the imposter\u2019s cloak \u2014 he\u2019s freezing.

Minutes passed in silence. . . . \nThen, before Harry\u2019s very eyes, the face of the man on the floor \nbegan to change.

He knew who he was. He had seen him \nin Dumbledore\u2019s Pensieve, had wa tched him being led away from \ncourt by the dementors, trying to convince Mr. Crouch that he was \ninnocent . . . but he was lined around the eyes now and looked \nmuch older. . . . \nVERITASER U M \n\u0091 683 \u0091 There were hurried footsteps ou tside in the corridor.

Her \nmouth opened wide and she let out a piercing shriek. \n\u201cMaster Barty, Master Barty, what is you doing here?\u201d \nShe flung herself forward on to the young man\u2019s chest. \n\u201cYou is killed him!

Dumbledore got up, bent over the man on the floor, and \npulled him into a sitting position against the wall beneath the \nFoe-Glass, in which the reflections of Dumbledore, Snape, and \nMcGonagall were sti ll glaring down upon them all. Winky re-\nmained on her knees, trembling, her hands over her face. Dum-\nbledore forced the man\u2019s mouth open and poured three drops \ninside it.

I wanted to be \nable to question him. To find out about his past, learn his habits, so that I could fool even Dumbledore. I also needed his hair to make \nthe Polyjuice Potion. The other ingredients were easy. I stole boom-slang skin from the dungeons. When the Potions master found me \nin his office, I said I was un der orders to search it.\u201d \n\u201cAnd what became of Wormtail after you attacked Moody?\u201d said \nDumbledore. \n\u201cWormtail returned to care for my master, in my father\u2019s house, \nand to keep watch over my father.\u201d \n\u201cBut your father escaped,\u201d said Dumbledore. \n\u201cYes. After a while he began to fi ght the Imperius Curse just as I \nhad done. There were periods wh en he knew what was happening. \nMy master decided it was no longer safe for my father to leave the \nhouse. He forced him to send le tters to the Ministry instead. He \nmade him write and say he was il l. But Wormtail neglected his \nduty. He was not watchful enough. My father escaped. My master \nguessed that he was heading for Ho gwarts. My father was going to \ntell Dumbledore everything, to co nfess. He was going to admit \nthat he had smuggled me from Azkaban."

Potter saw me \nstealing more ingredients for the Polyjuice Potion from Snape\u2019s of-\nfice one night. He thought I was my father. We have the same first \nname.

She looked slightly \nnauseous, as though she had ju st watched someone being sick. \nHowever, when she drew out her wand and pointed it at Barty \nCrouch, her hand was quite steady. \n\u201cSeverus\u201d \u2014 Dumbledore turned to Snape \u2014 \u201cplease tell Madam \nPomfrey to come down here; we ne ed to get Alas tor Moody into \nthe hospital wing.

So tired every bone in his body \nwas aching, he wanted nothing more than to sit here, undisturbed, \nfor hours and hours, until he fell as leep and didn\u2019t have to think or \nfeel anymore. \nThere was a soft rush of wings.

He bl inked and stared up at the ceiling. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t your fault, Harr y,\u201d Mrs. Weasle y whispered. \n\u201cI told him to take the cup with me,\u201d said Harry. Now the burning feeling was in his throat too. He wished Ron \nwould look away. \nMrs. Weasley set the potion down on the bedside cabinet, bent \ndown, and put her arms around Harry. He had no memory of ever \nbeing hugged like this, as though by a mother. The full weight of \neverything he had seen that night seemed to fall in upon him as \nMrs. Weasley held him to her. His mother\u2019s face, his father\u2019s voice, \nthe sight of Cedric, dead on the ground all started spinning in his head until he could hardly bear it, until he was screwing up his face \nagainst the howl of misery fighting to get out of him. \nThere was a loud slamming nois e, and Mrs. Weasley and Harry \nbroke apart. Hermione was standing by the window. She was hold-\ning something tight in her hand. \nTHE PARTING OF THE WAYS \n\u0091 715 \u0091 \u201cSorry,\u201d she whispered. \n\u201cYour potion, Harry,\u201d said Mrs. Weasley qu ickly, wiping her \neyes on the back of her hand. \nHarry drank it in one gulp. The e ffect was instantaneous. Heavy, \nirresistible waves of dreamless sl eep broke over him; he fell back \nonto his pillows an d thought no more. \nC H A P T E R T H I R T Y - S E V E N \n \n\u0091 716 \u0091 THE BEGINNING \n \n \n \nhen he looked back, even a mo nth later, Harry found he \nhad only scattered memories of the next few days. It was \nas though he had been through too much to take in any more. The \nrecollections he did have were very painful. The worst, perhaps, \nwas the meeting with the Diggorys that took place the following \nmorning. \nThey did not blame him for wh at had happened; on the con-\ntrary, both thanked him for return ing Cedric\u2019s body to them. Mr. \nDiggory sobbed through most of th e interview. Mr s. Diggory\u2019s \ngrief seemed to be beyond tears. \n\u201cHe suffered very little then,\u201d sh e said, when Harry had told her \nhow Cedric had died. \u201cAnd after a ll, Amos . . . he died just when \nhe\u2019d won the tournament. He must have been happy.\u201d \nWhen they got to their feet, she looked down at Harry and said, \n\u201cYou look after yourself, now.\u201d \nHarry seized the sack of gold on the bedside table.

From \nwhat Hermione and Ron told him , Dumbledore had spoken to the \nschool that morning at breakfast. He had merely requested that \nthey leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger \nhim to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most peo-\nple, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his \neyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed \nthat many of them ha d believed Rita Skeeter\u2019s article about how \ndisturbed and possibly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were for-\nmulating their own theories abou t how Cedric had died. He found \nhe didn\u2019t care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione and they were talking about other things, or else let-\nting him sit in si lence while they played ches s. He felt as though all \nthree of them had reac hed an understanding th ey didn\u2019t need to \nput into words; that each was wait ing for some sign, some word, of \nwhat was going on outside Hogwarts \u2014 and that it was useless to \nspeculate about what mi ght be coming until they knew anything \nfor certain.

He was \ndreading the Leaving Feast, whic h was usually a cause for celebra-\ntion, when the winner of the Inte r-House Championship would be \nannounced. He had avoi ded being in the Great Hall when it was \nfull ever since he had left the hosp ital wing, preferring to eat when \nit was nearly empty to avoid the stares of his fellow students. \nWhen he, Ron, and Hermione en tered the Hall, they saw at \nonce that the usual decorations were missing. The Great Hall was \nnormally decorated with the winn ing House\u2019s colors for the Leav-\ning Feast. Tonight, however, ther e were black drap es on the wall \nbehind the teachers\u2019 table. Harry knew instantly th at they were \nthere as a mark of respect to Cedric. \nThe real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden \nleg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, \njumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn\u2019t blame \nhim; Moody\u2019s fear of attack was bound to have been increased by \nhis ten-month imprisonment in hi s own trunk. Professor Karkar-\noff\u2019s chair was empty. Harry wond ered, as he sat down with the \nother Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Volde-\nmort had caught up with him. \nMadame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. \nThey were talking quietly together . Further along th e table, sitting \nnext to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on \nHarry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was \ndifficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry \ncontinued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away. \nWhat was it that Snape had don e on Dumbledore\u2019s orders, the \nnight that Voldemort had returned? And why . . . why . . . was \nTHE BEGINNING \n\u0091 721 \u0091 Dumbledore so convinced that Snap e was truly on their side? He \nhad been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape \nhad turned spy against Voldemort, \u201cat great person al risk.\u201d Was \nthat the job he had ta ken up again? Had he made contact with the \nDeath Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone \nover to Dumbledore, that he ha d been, like Voldemort himself, \nbiding his time? \nHarry\u2019s musings were ended by Professor Dumbledore, who \nstood up at the staff table. The Gr eat Hall, which in any case had \nbeen less noisy than it usually was at the Le aving Feast, became \nvery quiet. \n\u201cThe end,\u201d said Dumbledore, look ing around at them all, \u201cof \nanother year.\u201d \nHe paused, and his eyes fell upon the Hufflepuff table. Theirs \nhad been the most subdued table b efore he had gotten to his feet, \nand theirs were still the saddes t and palest faces in the Hall. \n\u201cThere is much that I would like to say to you all tonight,\u201d said \nDumbledore, \u201cbut I must first acknowledge the loss of a very fine \nperson, who should be sitting here,\u201d he gestured toward the Huf-\nflepuffs, \u201cenjoying our feast with us . I would like you all, please, to \nstand, and raise your glasses, to Cedric Diggory.\u201d \nThey did it, all of them; the be nches scraped as everyone in the \nHall stood, and raised their goblets, and echoed, in one loud, low, \nrumbling voice, \u201cCedric Diggory.\u201d \nHarry caught a glimpse of Cho through the crowd. There were \ntears pouring silently down her fa ce. He looked down at the table \nas they all sat down again. \n\u201cCedric was a person who exemplified many of the qualities that \ndistinguish Hufflepuff house,\u201d Dumbledore continued. \u201cHe was a"

People were staring at \nDumbledore in disbelief, in horror. He looked perfectly calm as he \nwatched them mutter themselves into silence. \n\u201cThe Ministry of Magic,\u201d Dumb ledore continue d, \u201cdoes not \nwish me to tell you this.

He \nforced himself to look back at Dumbledore. \n\u201cThere is somebody else who must be mentioned in connection \nwith Cedric\u2019s death,\u201d Dumbledore went on. \u201cI am talking, of course, \nabout Harry Potter.\u201d \nA kind of ripple crossed the Great Hall as a few heads turned in \nHarry\u2019s direction befo re flicking back to face Dumbledore. \n\u201cHarry Potter managed to escape Lord Voldemort,\u201d said Dum-\nbledore. \u201cHe risked his own life to return Cedric\u2019s body to Hog-\nwarts. He showed, in every respec t, the sort of bravery that few \nTHE BEGINNING \n\u0091 723 \u0091 wizards have ever shown in facing Lord Voldemort, and for this, I \nhonor him.\u201d \nDumbledore turned gravely to Harry and raised his goblet once \nmore. Nearly everyone in the Gr eat Hall followed suit. They mur-\nmured his name, as they had mu rmured Cedric\u2019s, and drank to \nhim. But through a gap in the st anding figures, Harry saw that \nMalfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and many of the other Slytherins had \nremained defiantly in their seats, their goblets untouched. Dumb-\nledore, who after all possessed no magical eye, did not see them. \nWhen everyone had once again resumed their seats, Dumble-\ndore continued, \u201cThe Triwizard To urnament\u2019s aim was to further \nand promote magical understanding. In the light of what has hap-pened \u2014 of Lord Voldemort\u2019s retu rn \u2014 such ties are more impor-\ntant than ever before.\u201d \nDumbledore looked fr om Madame Maxime and Hagrid, to \nFleur Delacour and her fellow Be auxbatons students, to Viktor \nKrum and the Durmstrangs at th e Slytherin table. Krum, Harry \nsaw, looked wary, almost frighten ed, as though he expected Dum-\nbledore to say something harsh. \n\u201cEvery guest in this Hall,\u201d sa id Dumbledore, and his eyes lin-\ngered upon the Durmstrang students, \u201cwill be welcomed back \nhere at any time, should they wish to come. I say to you all, once \nagain \u2014 in the light of Lord Voldemort\u2019s return, we are only as strong as we are united, as weak as we are divided. Lord Volde-\nmort\u2019s gift for spreading discord an d enmity is very great. We can \nfight it only by showing an equally strong bond of friendship and trust.

There wasn\u2019t a single cloud in the sky. Harry, \nRon, and Hermione had managed to get a compartment to them-\nselves. Pigwidgeon was once agai n hidden under Ro n\u2019s dress robes \nto stop him from hooting contin ually; Hedwig was dozing, her \nhead under her wing, and Crookshanks was curled up in a spare seat like a large, furry ginger cu shion. Harry, Ron, and Hermione \ntalked more fully and freely than th ey had all week as the train sped \nthem southward. Harry felt as th ough Dumbledore\u2019s speech at the \nLeaving Feast had unblocked him, somehow. It was less painful to \ndiscuss what had happened now. Th ey broke off their conversation \nabout what action Dumbledore might be taking, even now, to stop \nVoldemort only when the lunch trolley arrived. \nWhen Hermione returned from th e trolley and put her money \nback into her schoolbag, she dislodged a copy of the Daily Prophet \nthat she had been carrying in th ere.

Nor were they the only ones to \nhave done so. \n\u201cThought we\u2019d see what those three were up to,\u201d said Fred matter-\nof-factly, stepping onto Goyle an d into the compartment. He had \nhis wand out, and so did George, who was careful to tread on Mal-\nfoy as he followed Fred inside. \n\u201cInteresting effect,\u201d said Ge orge, looking down at Crabbe. \n\u201cWho used the Furnunculus Curse?\u201d \n\u201cMe,\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cOdd,\u201d said George lightly. \u201cI us ed Jelly-Legs. Looks as though \nthose two shouldn\u2019t be mixed. He s eems to have sprouted little ten-\ntacles all over his face. Well, let\u2019 s not leave them here, they don\u2019t \nadd much to the decor.\u201d \nRon, Harry, and George kicked, rolled, and pushed the uncon-\nscious Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyl e \u2014 each of whom looked dis-\ntinctly the worse for the jumble of jinxes with which they had been \nhit \u2014 out into the corridor, then came back into the compartment \nand rolled the door shut. \n\u201cExploding Snap, anyone?\u201d said Fred, pulling out a pack of \ncards. \nThey were halfway through their fifth game when Harry de-\ncided to ask them. \n\u201cYou going to tell us, then?\u201d he said to George. \u201cWho you were \nblackmailing?\u201d \n\u201cOh,\u201d said George darkly. \u201c That. \u201d \n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Fred, shaking his head impatiently. \u201cIt \nwasn\u2019t anything important. Not now, anyway.\u201d \n\u201cWe\u2019ve given up,\u201d said George, shrugging. \nTHE BEGINNING \n\u0091 731 \u0091 But Harry, Ron, and Hermione kept on asking, and finally, Fred \nsaid, \u201cAll right, all right, if you re ally want to know . . . it was Ludo \nBagman.\u201d \n\u201cBagman?\u201d said Harry sharply. \u201cAre you saying he was involved \nin \u2014\u201d \n\u201cNah,\u201d said George gloomily. \u201cNothing like that. Stupid git. He \nwouldn\u2019t have the brains.\u201d \n\u201cWell, what, then?\u201d said Ron. \nFred hesitated, then said, \u201cYou remember that bet we had with \nhim at the Quidditch World Cup? About how Ireland would win, \nbut Krum would get the Snitch?\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry and Ron slowly. \n\u201cWell, the git paid us in leprec h a u n g o l d h e \u2019 d c a u g h t f r o m t h e \nIrish mascots.\u201d \n\u201cSo?\u201d \n\u201cSo,\u201d said Fred impatiently, \u201ci t vanished, didn\u2019t it? By next \nmorning, it had gone!\u201d \n\u201cBut \u2014 it must\u2019ve been an accident, mustn\u2019t it?\u201d said Hermione. \nGeorge laughed very bitterly. \n\u201c Y e a h , t h a t \u2019 s w h a t w e t h o u g h t , a t first. We thought if we just \nwrote to him, and told him he\u2019d made a mistake, he\u2019d cough up. \nBut nothing doing. Ignored our lette r. We kept trying to talk to \nhim about it at Hogwarts, but he was always making some excuse \nto get away from us.\u201d \n\u201cIn the end, he turned pretty nast y,\u201d said Fred. \u201cTold us we were \ntoo young to gamble, and he wasn\u2019t giving us anything.\u201d \n\u201cSo we asked for our money back ,\u201d said George glowering. \n\u201cHe didn\u2019t refuse!\u201d gasped Hermione. \n\u201cRight in one,\u201d said Fred."

Lee Jordan\u2019s dad had had a bit of trouble \ngetting money off Bagman as well. Turns out he\u2019s in big trouble \nwith the goblins. Borrowed loads of gold off them. A gang of them \ncornered him in the woods after the World Cup and took all the \ngold he had, and it still wasn\u2019t enough to cover all his debts. They \nfollowed him all the way to Hogwarts to keep an eye on him. He\u2019s lost everything gambling. Hasn\u2019t got two Galleons to rub together. \nAnd you know how the idiot trie d to pay the goblins back?\u201d \n\u201cHow?\u201d said Harry. \u201cHe put a bet on you, mate,\u201d said Fred. \u201cPut a big bet on you to \nwin the tournament. Bet against the goblins.\u201d \n\u201cSo that\u2019s why he kept trying to help me win!\u201d said Harry. \n\u201cWell \u2014 I did win, di dn\u2019t I? So he can pay you your gold!\u201d \n\u201cNope,\u201d said George, shaking hi s head. \u201cThe goblins play as \ndirty as him. They say you drew with Diggory, and Bagman was \nbetting you\u2019d win outright. So Ba gman had to run for it. He did \nrun for it right afte r the third task.\u201d \nGeorge sighed deeply and started dealing out the cards again. \nThe rest of the journey passed pleasantly enough; Harry wished \nit could have gone on all summer, in fact, and that he would never \narrive at King\u2019s Cross . . . but as he had learned the hard way that \nyear, time will not slow down when someth ing unpleasant lies \nahead, and all too soon, the Hogw arts Express was pulling in at \nplatform nine and three-quarters . The usual confusion and noise \nfilled the corridors as the studen ts began to disembark. Ron and \nHermione struggled out past Malf oy, Crabbe, and Goyle, carrying \ntheir trunks. Harry, ho wever, stayed put. \nTHE BEGINNING \n\u0091 733 \u0091 \u201cFred \u2014 George \u2014 wait a moment.\u201d \nThe twins turned. Harry pulled open his trunk and drew out his \nTriwizard winnings. \n\u201cTake it,\u201d he said, an d he thrust the sack into George\u2019s hands. \n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Fred, lo oking flabbergasted. \n\u201cTake it,\u201d Harry repeated firmly. \u201cI don\u2019t want it.\u201d \n\u201cYou\u2019re mental,\u201d said George, trying to push it back at Harry. \n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d said Harry. \u201cYou take it, and get inventing. It\u2019s \nfor the joke shop.\u201d \n\u201cHe is mental,\u201d Fred said in an almost awed voice. \n\u201cListen,\u201d said Harry firmly. \u201cIf you don\u2019t take it, I\u2019m throwing it \ndown the drain. I don\u2019t want it an d I don\u2019t need it. But I could do \nwith a few laughs. We could all do with a few laughs . I\u2019ve got a feel-\ning we\u2019re going to need them more than usual before long.\u201d \n\u201cHarry,\u201d said George weakly, weighing the money bag in his \nhands, \u201cthere\u2019s got to be a thousand Galleons in here.\u201d \n\u201cYeah,\u201d said Harry, grinning. \u201cT hink how many Canary Creams \nthat is.\u201d \nThe twins stared at him. \n\u201cJust don\u2019t tell your mum where you got it . . . although she \nmight not be so keen for you to join the Ministry anymore, come \nto think of it. . . .\u201d \n\u201cHarry,\u201d Fred began, but Harry pulled out his wand. \n\u201cLook,\u201d he said flatly, \u201ctake it, or I\u2019ll hex you. I know some good \nones now. Just do me one favor, okay? Buy Ron some different dress \nrobes and say they\u2019re from you.\u201d \nHe left the compartment before they could say another word, \nstepping over Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were still lying on \nthe floor, covered in hex marks."
