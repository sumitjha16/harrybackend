 1  THE WORST BIRTHDA Y 
 
 
 
ot for the first time, an argument had broken out over breakfast at number four, Priv et Drive. Mr. Vernon Durs-
ley had been woken in the early hours of the morning by a loud, 
hooting noise from his nephew Harry’s room. 
“Third time this week!” he roared across the table. “If you can’t 
control that owl, it’ll have to go!” 
Harry tried, yet again, to explain. 
“She’s bored, ” he said. “She’s used to flying around outside. If I 
could just let her out at night —” 
“Do I look stupid?” snarled Uncle Vernon, a bit of fried egg dan-
gling from his bushy mustache. “I know what’ll happen if that 
owl’s let out.” 
He exchanged dark looks with his wife, Petunia. Harry tried to argue back but his words were drowned by a long, 
loud belch from the Dursleys’ son, Dudley. N 
CHAPTER ONE 
 2  “I want more bacon.” 
“There’s more in the frying pan, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia, 
turning misty eyes on her massive son. “We must build you up 
while we’ve got the chance. . . . I do n’t like the sound of that school 
food. . . .” 
“Nonsense, Petunia, I never went hungry when I was at Smelt-
ings,” said Uncle Vernon heartily . “Dudley gets enough, don’t you, 
son?” 
Dudley, who was so large his bottom drooped over either side of 
the kitchen chair, grinned and turned to Harry. 
“Pass the frying pan.” 
“You’ve forgotten the magic wo rd,” said Harry irritably. 
The effect of this simple sentence on the rest of the family was 
incredible: Dudley gasped and fell off his chair with a crash that 
shook the whole kitchen; Mrs. Du rsley gave a small scream and 
clapped her hands to her mouth; Mr. Dursley jumped to his feet, veins throbbing in his temples. 
“I meant ‘please’!” said Harry quickly. “I didn’t mean —” 
“WHAT HAVE I TOLD YOU,” thundered his uncle, spraying 
spit over the table, “ABOUT SAYING THE ‘M’ WORD IN OUR 
HOUSE?” 
“But I —” 
“HOW DARE YOU THREATEN DUDLEY!” roared Uncle 
Vernon, pounding the table with his fist. 
“I just —” “I WARNED YOU! I WILL NOT TOLERATE MENTION 
OF YOUR ABNORMALITY UNDER THIS ROOF!” 
Harry stared from his purple-faced uncle to his pale aunt, who 
was trying to heave Dudley to his feet. 
THE WORST BIRTHDAY 
 3  “All right,” said Harry, “ all right . . .” 
Uncle Vernon sat back down, brea thing like a winded rhinoceros 
and watching Harry closely out of the corners of his small, sharp 
eyes. 
Ever since Harry had come home for the summer holidays, Un-
cle Vernon had been treating him li ke a bomb that might go off at 
any moment, because Harry Potter wasn’t a normal boy. As a mat-
ter of fact, he was as not norm al as it is possible to be. 
Harry Potter was a wizard — a wizard fresh from his first year at 
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft an d Wizardry. And if the Dursleys 
were unhappy to have him back fo r the holidays, it was nothing to 
how Harry felt. 
H e m i s s e d H o g w a r t s s o m u c h i t w a s l i k e h a v i n g a c o n s t a n t 
stomachache. He missed the castle, with its secret passageways and 
ghosts, his classes (though perhaps not Snape, the Potions master), 
the mail arriving by ow l, eating banquets in the Great Hall, sleep-
ing in his four-poster bed in the tower dormitory, visiting the 
gamekeeper, Hagrid, in his cabin next to the Forbidden Forest in 
the grounds, and, especially, Quid ditch, the most popular sport in 
the wizarding world (six tall goal po sts, four flying balls, and four-
teen players on broomsticks). 
All Harry’s spellbooks , his wand, robes, cauldron, and top-of-
the-line Nimbus Two Thousand br oomstick had been locked in a 
cupboard under the stairs by Uncle Vernon the instant Harry had 
come home. What did the Dursleys care if Harry lost his place on 
the House Quidditch team because he hadn’t practiced all sum-mer? What was it to the Dursleys if Harry went back to school 
without any of his ho mework done? The Dursleys were what wiz-
ards called Muggles (not a drop of magical blood in their veins), 
CHAPTER ONE 
 4  and as far as they were concerned, having a wizard in the family was 
a matter of deepest shame. Un cle Vernon had even padlocked 
Harry’s owl, Hedwig, in side her cage, to stop her from carrying 
messages to an yone in the wizarding world. 
Harry looked nothing like the re st of the family. Uncle Vernon 
was large and neckless, with an enormous black mustache; Aunt 
Petunia was horse-faced and bony ; Dudley was blond, pink, and 
porky. Harry, on the other hand, was small and skinny, with bril-
liant green eyes and jet-black hair that was always untidy. He wore 
round glasses, and on his forehe ad was a thin, lightning-shaped 
scar. 
It was this scar that made Harry so particularly unusual, even for 
a wizard. This scar was the only hint of Harry’s very mysterious 
past, of the reason he had been left on the Dursleys’ doorstep 
eleven years before. 
At the age of one year old, Harry had some how survived a curse 
from the greatest Dark sorcerer of all time, Lord Voldemort, whose 
name most witches and wizards st ill feared to speak. Harry’s par-
ents had died in Voldemort’s a ttack, but Harry had escaped with 
his lightning scar, and somehow — nobody understood why — 
Voldemort’s powers had been destro yed the instant he had failed to 
kill Harry. 
So Harry had been brought up by his dead mother’s sister and her 
husband. He had spent ten years with the Dursleys, never un-
derstanding why he kept maki ng odd things happen without 
meaning to, believing the Dursleys’ story that he had got his scar in the car crash that ha d killed his parents. 
And then, exactly a year ago, Ho gwarts had written to Harry, 
 
THE WORST BIRTHDAY 
 5  and the whole story had come out. Harry had taken up his place at 
wizard school, where he and his scar were famous . . . but now the 
school year was over, and he was back with the Dursleys for the 
summer, back to being treated like a dog that had rolled in some-
thing smelly. 
The Dursleys hadn’t even rememb ered that today happened to 
be Harry’s twelfth birthday. Of co urse, his hopes hadn’t been high; 
they’d never given him a real present, let alon e a cake — but to ig-
nore it completely . . . 
At that moment, Uncle Vernon cleared his throat importantly 
and said, “Now, as we all know, today is a very important day.” 
Harry looked up, hardly daring to believe it. 
“This could well be the day I ma ke the biggest deal of my ca-
reer,” said Uncle Vernon. 
Harry went back to his toast. Of course, he thought bitterly, Un-
cle Vernon was talking about the stupid dinner party. He’d been talk-
ing of nothing else for two weeks. Some rich builder and his wife 
were coming to dinner and Uncle Vernon was hoping to get a huge 
order from him (Uncle Vernon ’s company made drills). 
“I think we should run through the schedule one more time,” 
said Uncle Vernon. “We should all be in position at eight o’clock. 
Petunia, you will be — ?” 
“In the lounge,” said Aunt Petunia promptly, “waiting to wel-
come them graciously to our home.” 
“Good, good. And Dudley?” 
“I’ll be waiting to open the door .” Dudley put on a foul, sim-
pering smile. “May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” 
“They’ll love him!” cried Aunt Pe tunia rapturously. 
 
CHAPTER ONE 
 6  “Excellent, Dudley,” said Uncl e Vernon. Then he rounded on 
Harry. “And you?” 
“I’ll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending I’m not 
there,” said Harry tonelessly. 
“Exactly,” said Uncle Vernon nastil y. “I will lead them into the 
lounge, introduce you, Petunia, and pour them drinks. At eight-
fifteen —” 
“I’ll announce dinner,” said Aunt Petunia. “And, Dudley, you’ll say —” 
“May I take you through to the dining room, Mrs. Mason?” said 
Dudley, offering his fat ar m to an invisible woman. 
“My perfect little gentleman! ” sniffed Aunt Petunia. 
“And you?” said Uncle Vernon viciously to Harry. 
“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not 
there,” said Harry dully. 
“Precisely. Now, we should aim to get in a few good compli-
ments at dinner. Petunia, any ideas?” 
“Vernon tells me you’re a wonderful golfer, Mr. Mason. . . . Do 
tell me where you bought your dress, Mrs. Mason. . . .” 
“Perfect . . . Dudley?” 
“How about — ‘We had to write an essay about our hero at 
school, Mr. Mason, and I wrote about you.’” 
This was too much for both Aunt Petunia and Harry. Aunt Petu-
nia burst into tears and hugged her son, while Harry ducked under 
the table so they woul dn’t see him laughing. 
“And you, boy?” 
Harry fought to keep his face straight as he emerged. 
“I’ll be in my room, making no noise and pretending I’m not 
there,” he said. 
THE WORST BIRTHDAY 
 7  “Too right, you will,” said Uncle Vernon forcefully. “The Ma-
sons don’t know anything about you and it’s going to stay that way. 
When dinner’s over, you take Mrs. Mason back to the lounge for 
coffee, Petunia, and I’ll bring the su bject around to drills. With any 
luck, I’ll have the deal signed and sealed befo re the news at ten. 
We’ll be shopping for a vacation home in Majorca this time to-
morrow.” 
Harry couldn’t feel too excited ab out this. He didn’t think the 
Dursleys would like him any better in Majorca than they did on 
Privet Drive. 
“Right — I’m off into town to pick up the dinner jackets for 
Dudley and me. And you,” he snarled at Harry. “You stay out of 
your aunt’s way while she’s cleaning.” 
Harry left through the back door. It was a brilliant, sunny day. 
He crossed the lawn, slumped down on the garden bench, and sang 
under his breath: 
“Happy birthday to me . . . happy birthday to me . . .” 
No cards, no presents, and he would be spending the evening 
pretending not to exist. He gazed miserably into the hedge. He had 
never felt so lonely. More than anything el se at Hogwarts, more 
even than playing Quidditch, Ha rry missed his best friends, Ron 
Weasley and Hermione Granger. They , however, didn’t seem to be 
missing him at all. Neither of them had written to him all summer, 
even though Ron had said he was going to ask Harry to come and 
stay. 
Countless times, Harry had been on the point of unlocking 
Hedwig’s cage by magic and sending her to Ron and Hermione with a letter, but it wasn’t worth the risk. Underage wizards weren’t 
allowed to use magic outside of school. Harry hadn’t told the 
CHAPTER ONE 
 8  Dursleys this; he knew it was only their terror that he might turn 
them all into dung beetles that stopped them from locking him in 
the cupboard under the stairs wi th his wand and broomstick. For 
the first couple of weeks back, Harry had enjoyed muttering non-sense words under his breath and watching Dudley tearing out of 
the room as fast as his fat legs would carry him. But the long silence 
from Ron and Hermione had made Harry feel so cut off from the 
magical world that even taunting Dudley had lost its appeal — and 
now Ron and Hermione had forgotten his birthday. 
What wouldn’t he give now for a message from Hogwarts? From 
any witch or wizard? He’d almost be glad of a sight of his arch-
enemy, Draco Malfoy, just to be sure it hadn’t all been a dream. . . . 
Not that his whole year at Hogwarts had been fun. At the very 
end of last term, Harry had come fa ce-to-face with none other than 
Lord Voldemort himself. Voldemort might be a ruin of his former 
self, but he was still terrifying, still cunning, still determined to re-
gain power. Harry had slipped th rough Voldemort’s clutches for a 
second time, but it had been a na rrow escape, and even now, weeks 
later, Harry kept waking in the night, drenched in cold sweat, won-
dering where Voldemort was now, remembering his livid face, his 
wide, mad eyes — 
Harry suddenly sat bolt upright on the garden bench. He had 
been staring absent-mindedly into the hedge — and the hedge was 
staring back. Two enormous green eyes had appeared among the 
leaves. 
Harry jumped to his feet just as a jeering voice floated across the 
lawn. 
“I know what day it is,” sa ng Dudley, waddling toward him. 
 
THE WORST BIRTHDAY 
 9  The huge eyes blinked and vanished. 
“What?” said Harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they 
had been. 
“ I k n o w w h a t d a y i t i s , ” D u d l e y r e p e a t e d , c o m i n g r i g h t u p t o 
him. 
“Well done,” said Harry. “So you’ ve finally learned the days of 
the week.” 
“Today’s your birthday, ” sneered Dudley. “How come you 
haven’t got any cards? Haven’t yo u even got friends at that freak 
place?” 
“Better not let your mum hear you talking about my school,” 
said Harry coolly. 
Dudley hitched up his trousers, which were slipping down his 
fat bottom. 
“Why’re you staring at the hedge?” he said suspiciously. 
“I’m trying to decide what would be the best spell to set it on 
fire,” said Harry. 
Dudley stumbled backward at on ce, a look of panic on his fat 
face. 
“You c-can’t — Dad told you yo u’re not to do m-magic — he 
said he’ll chuck you out of the house — and you haven’t got any-
where else to go — you haven’t got any friends to take you —” 
“Jiggery pokery !” said Harry in a fierce voice. “ Hocus pocus — 
squiggly wiggly —” 
“MUUUUUUM!” howled Dudley, tripping over his feet as he 
dashed back toward the house. “MUUUUM! He’s doing you know what!” 
Harry paid dearly for his moment of fun. As neither Dudley nor 
 
CHAPTER ONE 
 10  the hedge was in any way hurt, Aunt Petunia knew he hadn ’t really 
done magic, but he still had to du ck as she aimed a heavy blow at 
his head with the soapy frying pan. Then she gave him work to do, 
with the promise he wouldn’t eat again until he’d finished. 
While Dudley lolled around watching and eating ice cream, 
Harry cleaned the windows, washed the car, mowed the lawn, 
trimmed the flowerbeds, pruned and watered the roses, and re-
painted the garden bench. The sun blazed overhead, burning the 
back of his neck. Harry knew he shouldn’t have risen to Dudley’s 
bait, but Dudley had said the very thing Harry had been thinking himself . . . maybe he didn’t have any friends at Hogwarts. . . . 
Wish they could see fa mous Harry Potter now, he thought savagely 
as he spread manure on the flower beds, his back aching, sweat run-
ning down his face. 
It was half past seven in the ev ening when at last, exhausted, he 
heard Aunt Petunia calling him. 
“Get in here! And wa lk on the newspaper!” 
Harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen. On 
top of the fridge stood tonight’s pudding: a huge mound of 
whipped cream and sugared violets. A lo in o f ro as t po r k was s iz-
zling in the oven. 
“ E a t q u i c k l y ! T h e M a s o n s w i l l b e h e r e s o o n ! ” s n a p p e d A u n t 
Petunia, pointing to two slices of bread and a lump of cheese on the 
kitchen table. She was already wearing a salmon-pink cocktail 
dress. 
Harry washed his hands and bolted down his pitiful supper. The 
moment he had finished, Aunt Pe tunia whisked away his plate. 
“Upstairs! Hurry!” 
 
THE WORST BIRTHDAY 
 11  As he passed the door to the living room, Harry caught a 
glimpse of Uncle Vernon and Dudley in bow ties and dinner jack-
ets. He had only just reached th e upstairs landing when the door-
bell rang and Uncle Vernon’s furiou s face appeared at the foot of 
the stairs. 
“Remember, boy — one sound —” 
Harry crossed to his bedroom on tiptoe, slipped inside, closed 
the door, and turned to collapse on his bed. 
The trouble was, there was al ready someone sitting on it. 
C H A P T E R T W O 
 
 12  DOBBY’S WARNING 
 
 
 
arry managed not to shout out, but it was a close thing. The little creature on the bed had large, bat-like ears and 
bulging green eyes the size of tennis balls. Harry knew instantly 
that this was what ha d been watching him out of the garden hedge 
that morning. 
As they stared at each other, Harry heard Dudley’s voice from 
the hall. 
“May I take your coats, Mr. and Mrs. Mason?” 
The creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end 
of its long, thin nose touched the carpet. Har ry noticed that it was 
wearing what looked like an old pillowcase, with rips for arm- and leg-holes. 
“Er — hello,” said Harry nervously. 
“Harry Potter!” said the creature in a high-pitched voice Harry 
was sure would carry down the stai rs. “So long has Dobby wanted 
to meet you, sir . . . Such an honor it is. . . .” H 
DOBBY’S WARNING 
 13  “Th-thank you,” said Harry, edging along th e wall and sinking 
into his desk chair, next to Hedwig, who was asleep in her large 
cage. He wanted to ask, “What are you?” but thought it would sound too rude, so instead he said, “Who are you?” 
“Dobby, sir. Just Dobby. Dobby the house-elf,” said the crea-
ture. 
“Oh — really?” said Harry. “Er — I don’t want to be rude or 
anything, but — this isn’t a great time for me to have a house-elf in my bedroom.” 
Aunt Petunia’s high, false laugh sounded from the living room. 
The elf hung his head. 
“Not that I’m not pleased to meet you,” said Harry quickly, 
“but, er, is there any partic ular reason you’re here?” 
“Oh, yes, sir,” said Dobby earnestly. “Dobby has come to tell 
you, sir . . . it is difficult, si r . . . Dobby wonders where to be-
gin. . . .” 
“Sit down,” said Ha rry politely, pointing at the bed. 
To his horror, the elf burst in to tears — very noisy tears. 
“S-sit down !” he wailed. “ Never . . . never ever . . .” 
Harry thought he heard the voices downstairs falter. 
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, “I didn’t mean to offend you or any-
thing —” 
“Offend Dobby!” choked the elf. “Dobby has never been asked 
to sit down by a wizard — like an equal —” 
Harry, trying to say “Shh!” and look comforting at the same 
time, ushered Dobby ba ck onto the bed where he sat hiccoughing, 
looking like a large and very ugly doll. At last he managed to con-
trol himself, and sat with his grea t eyes fixed on Harry in an ex-
pression of watery adoration. 
CHAPTER TWO 
 14  “You can’t have met many decent wizards,” said Harry, trying to 
cheer him up. 
Dobby shook his head. Then, without warning, he leapt up and 
started banging his head furiou sly on the window, shouting, “ Bad 
Dobby! Bad Dobby!” 
“Don’t — what are you doing?” Harry hissed, springing up and 
pulling Dobby back onto the bed — Hedwig had woken up with a 
particularly loud screech and was beating her wings wildly against 
the bars of her cage. 
“Dobby had to punish himself, si r,” said the elf, who had gone 
slightly cross-eyed. “Dobby almost sp oke ill of his family, sir. . . .” 
“Your family?” “The wizard family Dobby serves , sir. . . . Dobby is a house-
elf — bound to serve one house an d one family forever. . . .” 
“Do they know you’re here ?” asked Harry curiously. 
Dobby shuddered. 
“Oh, no, sir, no . . . Dobby will have to punish himself most 
g r i e v o u s l y f o r c o m i n g t o s e e y o u , s i r . D o b b y w i l l h a v e t o s h u t h i s 
ears in the oven door for this . If they ever knew, sir —” 
“But won’t they notice if you shut your ears in the oven door?” 
“Dobby doubts it, sir. Dobby is always having to punish himself 
for something, sir. They lets Dobby get on with it, sir. Sometimes 
they reminds me to do ex tra punishments. . . .” 
“But why don’t you leave? Escape?” 
“A house-elf must be set free, sir. And the family will never set 
Dobby free . . . Dobby will serve the family until he dies, sir. . . .” 
Harry stared. “And I thought I had it bad stayin g here for another four weeks,” 
 
DOBBY’S WARNING 
 15  he said. “This makes the Dursleys sound almost human. Can’t any-
one help you? Can’t I?” 
Almost at once, Harry wished he hadn’t spoken. Dobby dis-
solved again into wails of gratitude. 
“Please,” Harry whispered frantica lly, “please be quiet. If the 
Dursleys hear anything, if they know you’re here —” 
“Harry Potter asks if he can help Dobby . . . Dobby has heard of 
your greatness, sir, but of your goodness, Dobby never knew. . . .” 
Harry, who was feeling distinctly hot in the face, said, “What-
ever you’ve heard about my greatnes s is a load of rubbish. I’m not 
even top of my year at Hogwarts; that’s Hermione, she —” 
But he stopped quickly, becaus e thinking about Hermione was 
painful. 
“Harry Potter is humble and modest,” said Dobby reverently, his 
orb-like eyes aglow. “Harry Potter speaks not of his triumph over 
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named —” 
“Voldemort?” said Harry. Dobby clapped his hands over hi s bat ears and moaned, “Ah, 
speak not the name, sir! Speak not the name!” 
“Sorry,” said Harry quickly. “I know lots of people don’t like it. 
My friend Ron —” 
He stopped again. Thinking about Ron was painful, too. 
Dobby leaned toward Harry, his eyes wide as headlights. 
“Dobby heard tell,” he said hoar sely, “that Harry Potter met the 
Dark Lord for a second time, just weeks ago . . . that Harry Potter 
escaped yet again. ” 
Harry nodded and Dobby’s eyes suddenly shone with tears. 
“Ah, sir,” he gasped, dabbing his fa ce with a corner of the grubby 
 
CHAPTER TWO 
 16  pillowcase he was wearing. “Harry Potter is valiant and bold! He 
has braved so many dangers alre ady! But Dobby has come to pro-
tect Harry Potter, to warn him, even if he does have to shut his ears 
in the oven door later. . . . Harry Potter must not go back to Hogwarts. ” 
There was a silence broken only by the chink of knives and forks 
from downstairs and the distant ru mble of Uncle Vernon’s voice. 
“W-what?” Harry stammered. “But I’ve got to go back — term 
starts on September first. It’s all that’s keeping me going. You don’t 
know what it’s like here. I don’t belong here. I belong in your 
world — at Hogwarts.” 
“No, no, no,” squeaked Dobby, shak ing his head so hard his ears 
flapped. “Harry Potter must stay wh ere he is safe. He is too great, 
too good, to lose. If Harry Potter go es back to Hogwarts, he will be 
in mortal danger.” 
“Why?” said Harry in surprise. “There is a plot, Harry Potter. A plot to make most terrible 
things happen at Hogw arts School of Witchc raft and Wizardry this 
year,” whispered Dobby, suddenly trembling all over. “Dobby has 
known it for months, sir. Harry Potter must not put himself in 
peril. He is too important, sir!” 
“What terrible things?” said Ha rry at once. “Who’s plotting 
them?” 
Dobby made a funny choking no ise and then banged his head 
frantically against the wall. 
“All right!” cried Harry, grabbing the elf’s arm to stop him. “You 
can’t tell me. I understand . But why are you warning me?” A sud-
den, unpleasant thought struck hi m. “Hang on — this hasn’t got 
anything to do with Vol — sorry — with You-Know-Who, has it? 
 
DOBBY’S WARNING 
 17  You could just shake or nod,” he added hastily as Dobby’s head 
tilted worryingly close to the wall again. 
Slowly, Dobby shook his head. 
“Not — not He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, sir —” 
But Dobby’s eyes were wide and he seemed to be trying to give 
Harry a hint. Harry, howeve r, was completely lost. 
“He hasn’t got a brother, has he?” 
Dobby shook his head, his eyes wider than ever. 
“Well then, I can’t think who else would have a chance of mak-
ing horrible things happen at Hogwarts,” said Harry. “I mean, 
there’s Dumbledore, for one thing — you know who Dumbledore is, don’t you?” 
Dobby bowed his head. “Albus Dumbledore is the greatest headmaster Hogwarts has 
ever had. Dobby knows it, sir. Dobby has heard Dumbledore’s 
powers rival those of He-Who-Mus t-Not-Be-Named at the height 
of his strength. But, sir” — Dobb y’s voice dropped to an urgent 
whisper — “there are powers Dumbledore doesn’t . . . powers no 
decent wizard . . .” 
And before Harry could stop him, Dobby bounded off the bed, 
seized Harry’s desk lamp, and st arted beating himself around the 
head with earspl itting yelps. 
A sudden silence fell downstairs. Two seconds later Harry, heart 
thudding madly, heard Uncle Vernon coming into the hall, calling, 
“Dudley must have left his television on again, the little tyke!” 
“Quick! In the closet!” hissed Harr y, stuffing Dobby in, shutting 
the door, and flinging himself onto the bed just as the door handle 
turned. 
 
CHAPTER TWO 
 18  “What — the — devil — are — you — doing?” said Uncle Ver-
non through gritted teeth, his fa ce horribly close to Harry’s. 
“You’ve just ruined the punch line of my Japanese golfer joke. . . . 
One more sound and you’ll wish you’d never been born, boy!” 
He stomped flat-foo ted from the room. 
Shaking, Harry let Dobb y out of the closet. 
“See what it’s like here?” he said. “See why I’ve got to go back to 
Hogwarts? It’s the only place I’ve got — well, I think I’ve got 
friends.” 
“Friends who don’t even write to Harry Potter?” said Dobby slyly. 
“I expect they’ve just been — wa it a minute,” said Harry, frown-
ing. “How do you know my friends haven’t been writing to me?” 
Dobby shuffled his feet. 
“Harry Potter mustn’t be angr y with Dobby. Dobby did it for 
the best —” 
“Have you been sto pping my letters ?” 
“Dobby has them here, sir,” said the elf. Stepping nimbly out of 
Harry’s reach, he pulled a thick wad of envelopes from the inside of 
the pillowcase he was wearing. Harry could make out Hermione’s 
neat writing, Ron’s untidy scrawl , and even a scribble that looked 
as though it was from the Hogwarts gamekeeper, Hagrid. 
Dobby blinked anxiously up at Harry. 
“Harry Potter mustn’t be angry. . . . Dobby hoped . . . if Harry 
Potter thought his friends had fo rgotten him . . . Harry Potter 
might not want to go back to school, sir. . . .” 
Harry wasn’t listening. He ma de a grab for the letters, but 
Dobby jumped out of reach. 
“Harry Potter will ha ve them, sir, if he gives Dobby his word 
 
DOBBY’S WARNING 
 19  that he will not return to Hogwarts. Ah, sir, this is a danger you 
must not face! Say you won’t go back, sir!” 
“No,” said Harry angr ily. “Give me my friends’ letters!” 
“Then Harry Potter leaves Dobby no choice,” said the elf sadly. 
Before Harry could move, Dobb y had darted to the bedroom 
door, pulled it open, and sprinted down the stairs. 
Mouth dry, stomach lurching, Ha rry sprang after him, trying 
not to make a sound. He jumped the last six steps, landing catlike 
on the hall carpet, lo oking around for Dobby. From the dining 
room he heard Uncle Vernon saying , “. . . tell Petunia that very 
funny story about those American plumbers, Mr. Mason. She’s 
been dying to hear . . .” 
Harry ran up the hall into the ki tchen and felt his stomach dis-
appear. 
Aunt Petunia’s masterpiece of a pudding, the mountain of cream 
and sugared violets, was floating u p n e a r t h e c e i l i n g . O n t o p o f a 
cupboard in the corner crouched Dobby. 
“No,” croaked Harry. “Please . . . they’ll kill me. . . .” 
“Harry Potter must say he’s not going back to school —” 
“Dobby . . . please . . .” 
“Say it, sir —” 
“I can’t —” 
Dobby gave him a tragic look. 
“Then Dobby must do it, sir, for Harry Potter’s own good.” 
The pudding fell to the floor with a heart-stopping crash. Cream 
splattered the windows and walls as the dish shattered. With a 
crack like a whip, Dobby vanished. 
There were screams from the di ning room and Uncle Vernon 
 
CHAPTER TWO 
 20  burst into the kitchen to find Harr y, rigid with shock, covered from 
head to foot in Aunt Petunia’s pudding. 
A t f i r s t , i t l o o k e d a s t h o u g h U n c l e V e r n o n w o u l d m a n a g e t o 
gloss the whole thing over. (“Ju st our nephew — very disturbed — 
meeting strangers upsets him, so we kept him upstairs. . . .”) He 
shooed the shocked Masons back in to the dining room, promised 
Harry he would flay him to within an inch of his life when the Ma-
sons had left, and handed him a mop. Aunt Petunia dug some ice 
cream out of the freezer and Harry, still shaking, started scrubbing 
the kitchen clean. 
Uncle Vernon might still have been able to make his deal — if it 
hadn’t been for the owl. 
Aunt Petunia was just passing around a box of after-dinner 
mints when a huge barn owl swooped through the dining room 
window, dropped a letter on Mrs. Mason’s head, and swooped out 
again. Mrs. Mason screamed like a banshee and ran from the house 
shouting about lunatics. Mr. Mason stayed just long enough to tell 
the Dursleys that his wife was mortal ly afraid of birds of all shapes 
and sizes, and to ask whether th is was their idea of a joke. 
Harry stood in the kitchen, clut ching the mop for support, as 
Uncle Vernon advanced on him, a demonic glint in his tiny eyes. 
“Read it!” he hissed evilly, brandi shing the letter the owl had de-
livered. “Go on — read it!” 
Harry took it. It did not contain birthday greetings. 
 
Dear Mr. Potter, 
We have received intelligence that a Hover Charm was 
used at your place of residenc e this evening at twelve min-
utes past nine. 
DOBBY’S WARNING 
 21  
As you know, underage wizards are not permitted to per-
form spells outside school, and further spellwork on your 
part may lead to expulsion from said school (Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Un derage Sorcery, 1875, Para-

We would also ask you to remember that any magical 
activity that risks notice by members of the non-magical 
community (Muggles) is a serious offense under section 13 
of the International Confederation of Warlocks’ Statute of 
Secrecy. 
Enjoy your holidays! 
Yours sincerely,

Harry looked up from the letter and gulped. 
“You didn’t tell us you weren’t allowed to use magic outside 
school,” said Uncle Vernon, a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. “For-
got to mention it. . . . Slipped your mind, I daresay. . . .” 
He was bearing down on Harry like a great bulldog, all his teeth 
bared. “Well, I’ve got news for you, boy. . . . I’m locking you up. . . . You’re never going back to that school . . . never . . . and if 
you try and magic yourself out — they’ll expel you!” 
And laughing like a maniac, he dragged Harry back upstairs. 
Uncle Vernon was as bad as hi s word. The following morning, 
CHAPTER TWO 
 22  he paid a man to fit bars on Harry’s window. He himself fitted a 
cat-flap in the bedroom door, so that small amount s of food could 
be pushed inside three times a da y. They let Harry out to use the 
bathroom morning and evening. Ot herwise, he was locked in his 
room around the clock. 
 
Three days later, the Dursleys were showing no sign of relenting, and Harry couldn’t see any way out of his situation. He lay on his 
bed watching the sun sinking behi nd the bars on the window and 
wondered miserably what was going to happen to him. 
What was the good of magicking himself out of his room if 
Hogwarts would expel him for doing it? Yet life at Privet Drive had 
reached an all-time low. Now that the Dursleys knew they weren’t going to wake up as fruit bats, he had lost his only weapon. Dobby 
might have saved Harry from horrible happenings at Hogwarts, but t he wa y thin gs we re go ing, h e’d pro ba bl y starv e to d eath any-way. 
The cat-flap rattled and Aunt Pe tunia’s hand appeared, pushing 
a bowl of canned soup into the room. Harry, whose insides were 
aching with hunger, jumped off his bed and seized it. The soup was 
stone-cold, but he drank half of it in one gulp. Then he crossed the 
room to Hedwig’s cage and tipped the soggy vegetables at the bot-
tom of the bowl into her empty food tray. She ruffled her feathers 
and gave him a look of deep disgust. 
“It’s no good turning your beak up at it — that’s all we’ve got,” 
said Harry grimly. 
He put the empty bowl back on th e floor next to the cat-flap and 
lay back down on the bed, some how even hungrier than he had 
been before the soup. 
DOBBY’S WARNING 
 23  Supposing he was still alive in another four weeks, what would 
happen if he didn ’t turn up at Hogwarts? Would someone be sent 
to see why he hadn ’t come back? Would they be able to make the Dursleys let him go? 
The room was growing dark. Ex hausted, stomach rumbling, 
mind spinning over the same un answerable questions, Harry fell 
into an uneasy sleep. 
He dreamed that he was on show in a zoo, with a card reading 
underage wizard attached to his cage. People goggled through 
the bars at him as he lay, starving and weak, on a bed of straw. He 
saw Dobby’s face in th e crowd and shouted ou t, asking for help, 
but Dobby called, “Harry Potter is safe there, sir!” and vanished. 
Then the Dursleys appeared and Dudley rattled the bars of the 
cage, laughing at him. 
“Stop it,” Harry muttered as the rattling pounded in his sore 
head. “Leave me alone . . . cut it out . . . I’m trying to sleep. . . .” 
He opened his eyes. Moonlight wa s shining through the bars on 
the window. And someone was goggling through the bars at him: a 
freckle-faced, red-haired, long-nosed someone. 
Ron Weasley was outs ide Harry’s window.

on!” breathed Harry, creeping to the window and pushing it 
up so they could talk thro ugh the bars. “Ron, how did 
you — What the — ?” 
Harry’s mouth fell open as the full impact of what he was see-
ing hit him. Ron was leaning ou t of the back window of an 
old turquoise car, which was parked in midair. Grinning at Harry 
from the front seats were Fred and George, Ron’s elder twin 
brothers. 
“All right, Harry?” asked George. 
“What’s been going on?” said Ron. “Why haven’t you been an-
swering my letters? I’ve asked you to stay about twelve times, and then Dad came home and said you’d got an official warning for us-ing magic in front of Muggles —” 
“It wasn’t me — and how did he know?” 
“He works for the Ministry,” said Ron. “You know we’re not sup-
posed to do spells outside school —” R 
THE BURROW 
 25  “You should talk,” sa id Harry, staring at the floating car. 
“Oh, this doesn’t count,” said Ro n. “We’re only borrowing this. 
It’s Dad’s, we didn’t enchant it. But doing magic in front of those 
Muggles you live with —” 
“I told you, I didn’t — but it’l l take too long to explain now — 
look, can you tell them at Hogwarts that the Dursleys have locked 
me up and won’t let me come back, and obviously I can’t magic 
myself out, because the Ministry’ll think that’s the second spell I’ve 
done in three days, so —” 
“ S t o p g i b b e r i n g , ” s a i d R o n . “ W e ’ v e c o m e t o t a k e y o u h o m e 
with us.” 
“But you can’t magic me out either —” 
“We don’t need to,” said Ron, jerking his head toward the front 
seat and grinning. “You forg et who I’ve got with me.” 
“Tie that around the bars,” said Fred, throwing the end of a rope 
to Harry. 
“If the Dursleys wake up, I’m de ad,” said Harry as he tied the 
rope tightly around a bar an d Fred revved up the car. 
“Don’t worry,” said Fred, “and stand back.” 
Harry moved back into the sh adows next to Hedwig, who 
seemed to have realized how impo rtant this was and kept still and 
silent. The car revved louder an d louder and suddenly, with a 
crunching noise, the bars were pu lled clean out of the window as 
Fred drove straight up in the air. Harry ran back to the window to 
see the bars dangling a few feet above the ground. Panting, Ron 
hoisted them up into the car. Ha rry listened anxiou sly, but there 
was no sound from th e Dursleys’ bedroom. 
When the bars were safely in the back seat with Ron, Fred re-
versed as close as possible to Harry’s window. 
CHAPTER THREE 
 26  “Get in,” Ron said. 
“But all my Hogwarts stuff — my wand — my broomstick —” 
“Where is it?” 
“Locked in the cupboard under the stairs, an d I can’t get out of 
this room —” 
“No problem,” said George from the front passenger seat. “Out 
of the way, Harry.” 
Fred and George climbed catlike through the window into 
Harry’s room. You had to hand it to them, thought Harry, as 
George took an ordinary hairpin from his pocket and started to 
pick the lock. 
“A lot of wizards think it’s a waste of time, knowing this sort of 
Muggle trick,” said Fred, “but we feel they’re skills worth learning, 
even if they are a bit slow.” 
There was a small click and the door swung open. 
“So — we’ll get your trunk — yo u grab anything you need from 
your room and hand it out to Ron,” whispered George. 
“Watch out for the bottom stair — it creaks,” Harry whispered 
back as the twins disappeared onto the dark landing. 
Harry dashed around his room, co llecting his things and passing 
them out of the window to Ron. Then he went to help Fred and 
George heave his trunk up the stairs. Harry heard Uncle Vernon 
cough. 
At last, panting, they reached th e landing, then carried the trunk 
through Harry’s room to the open wi ndow. Fred climbed back into 
the car to pull with Ron, and Ha rry and George pushed from the 
bedroom side. Inch by inch, the trunk slid through the window. 
Uncle Vernon co ughed again. 
 
THE BURROW 
 27  “A bit more,” panted Fred, who wa s pulling from inside the car. 
“One good push —” 
Harry and George threw their shoulders against the trunk and it 
slid out of the window into the back seat of the car. 
“Okay, let’s go,” George whispered. 
But as Harry climbed onto the windowsill there came a sudden 
loud screech from behind him, fo llowed immediately by the thun-
der of Uncle Vernon’s voice. 
“THAT RUDDY OWL!” 
“I’ve forgotten Hedwig!” 
Harry tore back across the room as the landing light clicked 
on — h e s n a t c h e d u p H e d w i g ’ s c a g e , d a s h e d t o t h e w i n d o w , a n d 
passed it out to Ron. He was scrambling back onto the chest of 
drawers when Uncle Vernon hamm ered on the unlocked door — 
and it crashed open. 
For a split second, Uncle Vernon stood framed in the doorway; 
then he let out a bellow like an angry bull and dived at Harry, 
grabbing him by the ankle. 
Ron, Fred, and George seized Har ry’s arms and pulled as hard as 
they could. 
“Petunia!” roared Uncle Vernon. “He’s getting away! HE’S 
GETTING AWAY!” 
But the Weasleys gave a gigantic tug and Harry’s leg slid out of 
Uncle Vernon’s grasp — Harry was in the car — he’d slammed the 
door shut — 
“Put your foot down, Fred!” ye lled Ron, and the car shot sud-
denly toward the moon. 
Harry couldn’t believe it — he wa s free. He rolled down the 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 28  window, the night air whipping hi s hair, and looked back at the 
shrinking rooftops of Privet Dr ive. Uncle Vernon, Aunt Petu-
nia, and Dudley were all hanging, dumbstruck, out of Harry’s 
window. 
“See you next summe r!” Harry yelled. 
The Weasleys roared with laught er and Harry settled back in his 
seat, grinning from ear to ear. 
“Let Hedwig out,” he told Ron. “She can fly behind us. She 
hasn’t had a chance to stretch her wings for ages.” 
George handed the hairpin to Ron and, a moment later, Hedwig 
soared joyfully out of the window to glide alongside them like a 
ghost. 
“So — what’s the story, Harry?” said Ron impatiently. “What’s 
been happening?” 
Harry told them all about Dobby, the warning he’d given Harry 
and the fiasco of the violet puddi ng. There was a long, shocked si-
lence when he had finished. 
“Very fishy,” said Fred finally. 
“Definitely dodgy,” agr eed George. “So he wouldn’t even tell 
you who’s supposed to be plotting all this stuff?” 
“I don’t think he could,” said Ha rry. “I told you, every time he 
got close to letting something slip, he started banging his head 
against the wall.” 
He saw Fred and George look at each other. 
“What, you think he was lying to me?” said Harry. 
“Well,” said Fred, “put it this way — house-elves have got pow-
erful magic of their own, but they can’t usually use it without their 
master’s permission. I reckon old Dobby was sent to stop you com- 
 
THE BURROW 
 29  ing back to Hogwarts. Someone’s id ea of a joke. Can you think of 
anyone at school with a grudge against you?” 
“Yes,” said Harry and Ro n together, instantly. 
“Draco Malfoy,” Harry explained. “He hates me.” 
“Draco Malfoy?” said George, turning around. “Not Lucius 
Malfoy’s son?” 
“Must be, it’s not a very common name, is it?” said Harry. 
“Why?” 
“I’ve heard Dad talking about him,” said George. “He was a big 
supporter of You-Know-Who.” 
“And when You-Know-Who disappe ared,” said Fred, craning 
around to look at Harry, “Lucius Malfoy came back saying he’d never meant any of it. Load of dung — Dad reckons he was right 
in You-Know-Who’s inner circle.” 
Harry had heard these rumors abou t Malfoy’s family before, and 
they didn’t surprise him at all. Malfoy made Dudley Dursley look 
like a kind, thoughtful, and sensitive boy. 
“I don’t know whether the Malfoys own a house-elf. . . .” said 
Harry. 
“Well, whoever owns him will be an old wizarding family, and 
they’ll be rich,” said Fred. 
“Yeah, Mum’s always wishing we had a house-elf to do the iron-
ing,” said George. “But all we’ve go t is a lousy old ghoul in the at-
tic and gnomes all over the garden. House-elves come with big old 
manors and castles and places like that; you wouldn’t catch one in 
our house. . . .” 
Harry was silent. Judging by the fa ct that Draco Malfoy usually 
had the best of everything, his family was rolling in wizard gold; he 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 30  could just see Malfoy strutting ar ound a large manor house. Send-
ing the family servant to stop Ha rry from going back to Hogwarts 
also sounded exactly like the sort of thing Malfoy would do. Had 
Harry been stupid to take Dobby seriously? 
“I’m glad we came to get you, an yway,” said Ron. “I was getting 
really worried when you didn’t an swer any of my letters. I thought 
it was Errol’s fa ult at first —” 
“Who’s Errol?” 
“Our owl. He’s ancient. It wouldn ’t be the first time he’d col-
lapsed on a delivery. So then I tried to borrow Hermes —” 
“Who?” 
“The owl Mum and Dad bought Percy when he was made pre-
fect,” said Fred from the front. 
“But Percy wouldn’t lend him to me,” said Ron. “Said he needed 
him.” 
“Percy’s been acting very oddly this summer,” said George, 
frowning. “And he has been sending a lot of letters and spending a 
load of time shut up in his room. . . . I mean, there’s only so many 
times you can polish a prefect badge. . . . Yo u’re driving too far 
west, Fred,” he added, pointing at a compass on the dashboard. 
Fred twiddled the steering wheel. 
“So, does your dad know you’ve got the car?” said Harry, guess-
ing the answer. 
“Er, no,” said Ron, “he had to work tonight. Hopefully we’ll be 
able to get it back in the garage without Mum noticing we flew it.” 
“What does your dad do at the Ministry of Magic, anyway?” 
“He works in the most boring department,” said Ron. “The 
Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office.” 
 
THE BURROW 
 31  “The what ?” 
“It’s all to do with bewitching th ings that are Muggle-made, you 
know, in case they end up back in a Muggle shop or house. Like, 
last year, some old witch died and her tea set was sold to an an-
tiques shop. This Muggle woman bought it, took it home, and 
tried to serve her friends tea in it. It was a nightmare — Dad was 
working overtime for weeks.” 
“What happened?” 
“The teapot went berserk and sq uirted boiling tea all over the 
place and one man ended up in th e hospital with the sugar tongs 
clamped to his nose. Dad was going frantic — it’s only him and an old warlock called Perkins in th e office — and they had to do 
Memory Charms and all sorts of stuff to cover it up —” 
“But your dad — this car —” 
Fred laughed. “Yeah, Dad’s craz y about everything to do with 
Muggles; our shed’s full of Muggle stuff. He takes it apart, puts 
spells on it, and puts it back together again. If he raided our house 
he’d have to put himself unde r arrest. It drives Mum mad.” 
“That’s the main road,” said George, peering down through the 
windshield. “We’ll be there in ten minutes. . . . Just as well, it’s get-
ting light. . . .” 
A faint pinkish glow was visible along the horizon to the east. 
Fred brought the car lower, an d Harry saw a dark patchwork of 
fields and clumps of trees. 
“We’re a little way outside the village,” said George. “Ottery St. 
Catchpole.” 
Lower and lower went th e flying car. The edge of a brilliant red 
sun was now gleaming through the trees. 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 32  “Touchdown!” said Fred as, with a slight bump, they hit the 
ground. They had landed next to a tumbledown garage in a small 
yard, and Harry looked out for th e first time at Ron’s house. 
It looked as though it had on ce been a large stone pigpen, but 
extra rooms had been added here and there until it was several sto-
ries high and so crooked it looked a s t h o u g h i t w e r e h e l d u p b y magic (which, Harry reminded himsel f, it probably was). Four or 
five chimneys were perched on top of the red roof. A lopsided sign stuck in the ground near the entrance read, the burrow . Around 
the front door lay a jumble of ru bber boots and a very rusty caul-
dron. Several fat brown chickens were pecking their way around the yard. 
“It’s not much,” said Ron. “It’s wonderful, ” said Harry happily, thin king of Privet Drive. 
They got out of the car. “Now, we’ll go upstairs really qu ietly,” said Fred, “and wait for 
Mum to call us for breakfast. Then, Ron, you come bounding 
downstairs going, ‘Mum, look who turned up in the night!’ and 
she’ll be all pleased to see Harry and no on e need ever know we 
flew the car.” 
“Right,” said Ron. “Come on, Harry, I sleep at the — at the 
top —” 
Ron had gone a nasty greenish color, his eyes fixed on the house. 
The other three wheeled around. 
Mrs. Weasley was marching across the yard, scattering chickens, 
and for a short, plump, kind-faced woman, it was remarkable how 
much she looked like a saber-toothed tiger. 
“Ah,” said Fred. 
 
THE BURROW 
 33  “Oh, dear,” said George. 
Mrs. Weasley came to a halt in front of them, her hands on her 
hips, staring from one guilty face to the next. She was wearing a 
flowered apron with a wand sticking out of the pocket. 
“So,” she said. 
“ ’Morning, Mum,” said George, in what he clearly thought was 
a jaunty, winning voice. 
“Have you any idea ho w worried I’ve been?” said Mrs. Weasley 
in a deadly whisper. 
“Sorry, Mum, but see, we had to —” 
All three of Mrs. Weasley’s sons were taller than she was, but 
they cowered as her rage broke over them. 
“Beds empty ! No note ! Car gone — could have crashed — out of my 
mind with worry — did you care ? — never, as long as I’ve lived — 
you wait until your fath er gets home, we never had trouble like this 
from Bill or Charlie or Percy — ” 
“Perfect Percy,” muttered Fred. “YOU COULD DO WITH TAKING A LEAF OUT OF 
PERCY’S BOOK!” yelled Mrs. Weasley, prodding a finger in Fred’s 
chest. “You could have died, you could have been seen, you could 
have lost your father his job —” 
It seemed to go on for hours. Mrs. Weasley had shouted herself 
hoarse before she turned on Harry, who backed away. 
“I’m very pleased to see you, Harry, dear,” she said. “Come in 
and have some breakfast.” 
She turned and walked back in to the house and Harry, after a 
nervous glance at Ron, who nodded encouragingly, followed her. 
The kitchen was small and rather cramped. There was a 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 34  scrubbed wooden table and chairs in the middle, and Harry sat 
down on the edge of hi s seat, looking around . He had never been 
in a wizard house before. 
The clock on the wall opposite him had only one hand and no 
numbers at all. Written around the edge were things like Time to 
make tea, Time to feed the chickens, and You’re late. Books were 
stacked three deep on the mantelpiece, books with titles like Charm Your Own Cheese, Enchantment in Baking, and One Minute 
Feasts — It’s Magic ! And unless Harry’s ears were deceiving him, the 
old radio next to the sink had just announced that coming up was 
“Witching Hour, with the popular singing sorceress, Celestina 
Warbeck.” 
Mrs. Weasley was clattering around, cooking breakfast a little 
haphazardly, throwing dirty looks at her sons as sh e threw sausages 
into the frying pan. Every now an d then she muttered things like 
“don’t know what you were thinking of,” and “ never would have 
believed it.” 
“I don’t blame you, dear,” she assured Ha rry, tipping eight or 
nine sausages onto his plate. “Arthur and I have been worried about 
you, too. Just last night we were saying we’d come and get you our-
selves if you hadn’t written back to Ron by Friday. But really” (she 
was now adding three fried eggs to his plate), “flying an illegal car 
halfway across the country — anyone could have seen you —” 
She flicked her wand casually at the dishes in the sink, which be-
gan to clean themselves, clinki ng gently in the background. 
“It was cloudy, Mum!” said Fred. 
“You keep your mouth closed whil e you’re eating!” Mrs. Weasley 
snapped. 
“They were starving him , Mum!” said George. 
THE BURROW 
 35  “And you!” said Mrs. Weasley, bu t it was with a slightly softened 
expression that she started cutting Harry bread and buttering it for 
him. 
At that moment there was a diversion in the form of a small, red-
headed figure in a long nightdre ss, who appeared in the kitchen, 
gave a small squeal, and ran out again. 
“Ginny,” said Ron in an undertone to Harry. “My sister. She’s 
been talking about you all summer.” 
“Yeah, she’ll be wanting your autograph, Harry,” Fred said with 
a grin, but he caught his mother’s eye and bent his face over his 
plate without another word. Nothin g more was said until all four 
plates were clean, which took a surprisingly short time. 
“Blimey, I’m tired,” yawned Fred, setting down his knife and 
fork at last. “I think I’ll go to bed and —” 
“You will not,” snapped Mrs. Weasley. “It’s your own fault 
you’ve been up all night. You’re going to de-gnome the garden for me; they’re getting completely out of hand again —” 
“Oh, Mum —” 
“And you two,” she said, glaring at Ron and Fred. “You can go 
up to bed, dear,” she added to Harry. “You didn’t ask them to fly 
that wretched car —” 
But Harry, who felt wide awake, said quickly, “I’ll help Ron. I’ve 
never seen a de-gnoming —” 
“That’s very sweet of you, dear, but it’s dull work,” said Mrs. 
Weasley. “Now, let’s see what Lockhart’s got to say on the 
subject —” 
And she pulled a heavy book from the stack on the mantelpiece. 
George groaned. 
“Mum, we know how to de-gnome a garden —” 
CHAPTER THREE 
 36  Harry looked at the cover of Mr s. Weasley’s book. Written across 
it in fancy gold letters were the words Gilderoy Lockhart’s Guide to 
Household Pests. There was a big photograph on the front of a very 
good-looking wizard with wavy blon d hair and bright blue eyes. As 
always in the wizarding world, the photograph was moving; the 
wizard, who Harry supposed was Gild eroy Lockhart, kept winking 
cheekily up at them all. Mrs. Weasley beamed down at him. 
“Oh, he is marvelous,” she said . “He knows his household pests, 
all right, it’s a wo nderful book. . . .” 
“Mum fancies him,” said Fred, in a very audible whisper. 
“Don’t be so ridiculous, Fred,” said Mrs. Weasley, her cheeks 
rather pink. “All right, if you t hink you know better than Lockhart, 
you can go and get on with it, an d woe betide you if there’s a sin-
gle gnome in that garden when I come out to inspect it.” 
Yawning and grumbling, the Weasleys slouched outside with 
Harry behind them. The garden was la rge, and in Harry’s eyes, ex-
actly what a garden should be. Th e Dursleys wouldn’t have liked 
it — there were plenty of weeds, and the grass needed cutting — 
but there were gnarled trees all around the walls, plants Harry had 
never seen spilling from every flow er bed, and a big green pond full 
of frogs. 
“Muggles have garden gnomes, too, you know,” Harry told Ron 
as they crossed the lawn. 
“Yeah, I’ve seen those things they think are gnomes,” said Ron, 
bent double with his head in a peony bush, “like fat little Santa 
Clauses with fishing rods. . . .” 
There was a violent scuffling nois e, the peony bush shuddered, 
and Ron straightened up. “ This is a gnome,” he said grimly. 
 
THE BURROW 
 37  “Gerroff me! Gerroff me!” squealed the gnome. 
It was certainly nothing like Sant a Claus. It was small and leath-
ery looking, with a large, knobby, bald head exactly like a potato. 
Ron held it at arm’s length as it kicked out at him with its horny lit-
tle feet; he grasped it around the ankles and turned it upside down. 
“This is what you have to do,” he said. He raised the gnome 
above his head (“Gerroff me!”) and st arted to swing it in great cir-
cles like a lasso. Seeing the sh ocked look on Harry’s face, Ron 
added, “It doesn’t hurt them — you’ve just got to make them really 
dizzy so they can’t find their way back to the gnomeholes.” 
He let go of the gnome’s ankles: It flew twenty feet into the air 
and landed with a thud in the field over the hedge. 
“Pitiful,” said Fred. “I bet I can get mine beyond that stump.” 
Harry learned quickly not to feel too sorry for the gnomes. He 
decided just to drop the first one he caught over the hedge, but the 
gnome, sensing weakness, sank it s razor-sharp teeth into Harry’s 
finger and he had a hard jo b shaking it off — until — 
“Wow, Harry — that must’ve been fifty feet. . . .” 
The air was soon thick with flying gnomes. 
“See, they’re not too bright,” sa id George, seizing five or six 
gnomes at once. “The moment th ey know the de-gnoming’s going 
on they storm up to have a look. You’d think they’d have learned by 
now just to stay put.” 
Soon, the crowd of gnomes in th e field started walking away in 
a straggling line, their li ttle shoulders hunched. 
“They’ll be back,” said Ron as they watched the gnomes disap-
pear into the hedge on the other side of the field. “They love it 
here. . . . Dad’s too soft with them ; he thinks they’re funny. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 38  Just then, the fron t door slammed. 
“He’s back!” said George. “Dad’s home!” 
They hurried through the garden and back into the house. 
Mr. Weasley was slumped in a kitc hen chair with his glasses off 
and his eyes closed. He was a thin man, going bald, but the little 
hair he had was as red as any of his children’s. He was wearing long 
green robes, which were dusty and travel-worn. 
“What a night,” he mumbled, groping for the teapot as they all 
sat down around him. “Nine raids. Nine! And old Mundungus 
Fletcher tried to put a hex on me when I had my back turned. . . .” 
Mr. Weasley took a long gulp of tea and sighed. 
“Find anything, Dad?” said Fred eagerly. 
“All I got were a few shrinking door keys and a biting kettle,” 
yawned Mr. Weasley. “There was some pretty nasty stuff that 
wasn’t my department, though. Mortlake was taken away for ques-
tioning about some extremely odd ferrets, but that’s the Commit-
tee on Experiment al Charms, thank goodness. . . .” 
“Why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?” said 
George. 
“Just Muggle-baiting,” sighed Mr. Weasley. “Sell them a key that 
keeps shrinking to nothing so they can never find it when they 
need it. . . . Of course, it’s very hard to convict anyone because no 
Muggle would admit their key keeps shrinking — they’ll insist 
they just keep losing it. Bless them, they’ll go to any lengths to ig-
nore magic, even if it’s staring th em in the face. . . . But the things 
our lot have taken to enchanting, you wouldn’t believe —” 
“LIKE CARS, FOR INSTANCE?” Mrs. Weasley had appeared, holding a long poker like a sword. 
Mr. Weasley’s eyes jerk ed open. He stared gu iltily at his wife. 
THE BURROW 
 39  “C-cars, Molly, dear?” 
“Yes, Arthur, cars,” said Mrs. Weasley, her eyes flashing. “Imag-
ine a wizard buying a rusty old car and telling his wife all he wanted 
to do with it was take it apar t to see how it worked, while really he 
was enchanting it to make it fly.” 
Mr. Weasley blinked. 
“Well, dear, I think you’ll find th at he would be quite within the 
law to do that, even if — er — he maybe would have done better 
to, um, tell his wife the truth. . . . There’s a loophole in the law, 
you’ll find. . . . As long as he wasn’t intending to fly the car, the fact 
that the car could fly wouldn’t —” 
“Arthur Weasley, you made sure there was a loophole when you 
wrote that law!” shouted Mrs. Weas ley. “Just so you could carry on 
tinkering with all that Muggle ru bbish in your shed! And for your 
information, Harry arrived this mo rning in the car you weren’t in-
tending to fly!” 
“Harry?” said Mr. Weasle y blankly. “Harry who?” 
He looked around, saw Harry, and jumped. 
“Good lord, is it Harry Potter? Ve ry pleased to meet you, Ron’s 
told us so much about —” 
“Your sons flew that car to Harry’s house and back last night !” 
shouted Mrs. Weasley. “What have you got to say about that, eh?” 
“Did you really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Did it go all right? 
I — I mean,” he faltered as sparks flew from Mrs. Weasley’s eyes, 
“that — that was very wrong, bo ys — very wrong indeed. . . .” 
“Let’s leave them to it,” Ron mu ttered to Harry as Mrs. Weasley 
swelled like a bullfrog. “Come on, I’ll show you my bedroom.” 
They slipped out of the kitchen and down a narrow passageway 
to an uneven staircase, which wound its way, zigzagging up 
CHAPTER THREE 
 40  through the house. On the third landing, a door stood ajar. Harry 
just caught sight of a pair of br ight brown eyes staring at him be-
fore it closed with a snap. 
“Ginny,” said Ron. “You don’t know how weird it is for her to be 
this shy. She never sh uts up normally —” 
They climbed two more flights until they reached a door with 
peeling paint and a small plaque on it, saying ronald’s room . 
Harry stepped in, his head almost touching the sloping ceiling, 
and blinked. It was like walking in to a furnace: Nearly everything 
in Ron’s room seemed to be a violent shade of orange: the bed-
spread, the walls, even the ceiling. Then Harry realized that Ron had covered nearly every inch of th e shabby wallpape r with posters 
of the same seven witches and wizards, all wearing bright orange robes, carrying broomsticks, and waving energetically. 
“Your Quidditch team?” said Harry. “The Chudley Cannons,” said Ron, pointing at the orange bed-
spread, which was emblazoned with two giant black C’s and a 
speeding cannonball. “N inth in the league.” 
Ron’s school spellbooks were stacke d untidily in a corner, next to 
a pile of comics that all seemed to feature The Adventures of Martin 
Miggs, the Mad Muggle. Ron’s magic wand was lying on top of a fish 
tank full of frog spawn on the windowsill, next to his fat gray rat, 
Scabbers, who was snoozing in a patch of sun. 
Harry stepped over a pack of Se lf-Shuffling playing cards on the 
floor and looked out of the tiny window. In the field far below he 
could see a gang of gnomes sneaki ng one by one ba ck through the 
Weasleys’ hedge. Then he turned to look at Ron, who was watch-
ing him almost nervously, as th ough waiting for his opinion. 
 
THE BURROW 
 41  “It’s a bit small,” said Ron quickl y. “Not like that room you had 
with the Muggles. And I’m right underneath the ghoul in the attic; 
he’s always banging on the pipes and groaning. . . .” 
But Harry, grinning widely, said, “T his is the best house I’ve ever 
been in.” 
Ron’s ears went pink. 
C H A P T E R F O U R 
 
 42  AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 
 
ife at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet 
Drive. The Dursleys liked ev erything neat and ordered; the 
Weasleys’ house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got 
a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen man-
telpiece and it shouted, “ Tuck your shirt in, scruffy !” The ghoul in 
the attic howled and dropped pipe s whenever he felt things were 
getting too quiet, and small expl osions from Fred and George’s 
bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found 
most unusual about life at Ron’s, however, wasn’t the talking mir-ror or the clanking gh oul: It was the fact that everybody there 
seemed to like him. 
Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force 
him to eat fourth helpings at ev ery meal. Mr. Weas ley liked Harry 
to sit next to him at the dinner ta ble so that he could bombard him 
with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how 
things like plugs and th e postal service worked. L 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 43  “Fascinating !” he would say as Harry talked him through using a 
telephone. “ Ingenious, really, how many ways Muggles have found 
of getting along without magic.” 
Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week 
after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to 
breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting 
at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny acciden-
tally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry 
entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and 
emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he 
hadn’t noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. 
Weasley offered him. 
“Letters from school,” said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron 
identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. 
“Dumbledore already knows you’ re here, Harry — doesn’t miss a 
trick, that man. You two’ve got th em, too,” he added, as Fred and 
George ambled in, sti ll in their pajamas. 
For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. 
Harry’s told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from 
King’s Cross station on September fi rst. There was also a list of the 
new books he’d need for the coming year. 
second-year students will require: 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 
by Miranda Goshawk 
Break with a Banshee by Gilderoy Lockhart 
Gadding with Ghouls by Gilderoy Lockhart 
Holidays with Hags by Gilderoy Lockhart 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 44  Travels with Trolls by Gilderoy Lockhart 
Voyages with Vampires by Gilderoy Lockhart 
Wanderings with Werewolves by Gilderoy Lockhart 
Year with the Yeti by Gilderoy Lockhart 
Fred, who had finished his own li st, peered over at Harry’s. 
“You’ve been told to get all Lockhart’s books, too!” he said. “The 
new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher must be a fan — bet it’s 
a witch.” 
At this point, Fred caught his mother’s eye and quickly busied 
himself with the marmalade. 
“That lot won’t come cheap,” said George, with a quick look at 
his parents. “Lockhar t’s books are really expensive. . . .” 
“Well, we’ll manage,” said Mrs. Weasley, but she looked wor-
ried. “I expect we’ll be able to pick up a lot of Ginny’s things 
secondhand.” 
“Oh, are you starting at Hogwarts this year?” Harry asked 
Ginny. 
She nodded, blushing to the root s of her flaming hair, and put 
her elbow in the butter dish. Fort unately no one saw this except 
Harry, because just then Ron’s elder brother Percy walked in. He was already dressed, his Hogwarts prefect badge pinned to his 
sweater vest. 
“Morning, all,” said Perc y briskly. “Lovely day.” 
He sat down in the only remaining chair but leapt up again al-
most immediately, pulling from underneath him a molting, gray 
feather duster — at least, that was what Harry thought it was, un-til he saw that it was breathing. 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 45  “Errol!” said Ron, taking the limp owl from Percy and extracting 
a letter from under its wing. “ Finally — he’s got Hermione’s an-
swer. I wrote to her sa ying we were going to try and rescue you 
from the Dursleys.” 
He carried Errol to a perch just inside the back door and tried to 
stand him on it, but Er rol flopped straight off again so Ron laid 
him on the draining board instead, muttering, “Pathetic.” Then he 
ripped open Hermione’s lett er and read it out loud: 
“‘Dear Ron, and Harry if you’re there, 
“‘I hope everything went all right and that Harry is okay and that 
you didn’t do anything illegal to get him out, Ron, because that would 
get Harry into trouble, too. I’ve been really worried and if Harry is all 
right, will you please let me know at once, but perhaps it would be bet-ter if you used a different owl, be cause I think another delivery might 
finish your one off. 
“‘I’m very busy with schoolwork, of course ’ — How can she be?” 
said Ron in horror. “We’re on vacation! — ‘ and we’re going to Lon-
don next Wednesday to buy my new books. Why don’t we meet in Di-
agon Alley ? 
“‘L e t m e k n o w w h a t ’ s h a p p e n i n g a s s o o n a s y o u c a n . L o v e f r o m 
Hermione .’ ” 
“Well, that fits in nicely, we ca n go and get all your things then, 
too,” said Mrs. Weasley, starting to clear the table. “What’re you all 
up to today?” 
Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to 
a small paddock the Weasleys ow ned. It was surrounded by trees 
that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they 
could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn’t fly too high. 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 46  They couldn’t use real Quidditch balls, which would have been 
hard to explain if they had escape d and flown away over the village; 
instead they threw apples for one an other to catch. They took turns 
riding Harry’s Nimbus Two Thousa nd, which was easily the best 
broom; Ron’s old Shooting Star wa s often outstripped by passing 
butterflies. 
Five minutes later they were ma rching up the hill, broomsticks 
over their shoulders. They had asked Percy if he wanted to join 
them, but he had said he was bu sy. Harry had only seen Percy at 
mealtimes so far; he stayed shut in his room the rest of the time. 
“Wish I knew what he was up to,” said Fred, frowning. “He’s not 
himself. His exam results came th e day before you did; twelve 
O.W.L.s and he hardly gloated at all.” 
“Ordinary Wizarding Levels,” Ge orge explained, seeing Harry’s 
puzzled look. “Bill got twelve, too. If we’re not careful, we’ll have 
another Head Boy in the family. I don’t think I could stand the 
shame.” 
Bill was the oldest Weasley brot her. He and the next brother, 
Charlie, had already left Hogwar ts. Harry had never met either of 
them, but knew that Charlie was in Romania studying dragons and 
Bill in Egypt working for the wizard’s bank, Gringotts. 
“Dunno how Mum and Dad are goin g to afford all our school 
stuff this year,” said George afte r a while. “Five sets of Lockhart 
books! And Ginny needs robes and a wand and everything. . . .” 
Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an under-
ground vault at Gringotts in Lon don was a small fortune that his 
parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn’t use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts 
 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 47  in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank ac-
count to the Dursleys; he didn’t think their horror of anything con-
nected with magic would stretc h to a large pile of gold. 
 
Mrs. Weasley woke them all earl y the following Wednesday. After 
a quick half a dozen bacon sandwi ches each, they pulled on their 
coats and Mrs. Weasley took a fl owerpot off the kitchen mantel-
piece and peer ed inside. 
“We’re running low, Arthur,” she sighed. “We’ll have to buy 
some more today. . . . Ah well, gu ests first! After you, Harry dear!” 
And she offered him the flowerpot. 
Harry stared at them all watching him. 
“W-what am I supposed to do?” he stammered. 
“He’s never traveled by Floo powder,” said Ron suddenly. “Sorry, 
Harry, I forgot.” 
“Never?” said Mr. Weasley. “But how did you get to Diagon Al-
ley to buy your school things last year?” 
“I went on the Underground —” 
“Really?” said Mr. Weasley eagerly. “Were there escapators ? How 
exactly —” 
“Not now, A r t h u r , ” s a i d M r s . W e a s l e y . “ F l o o p o w d e r ’ s a l o t 
quicker, dear, but goodness me, if you’ve never used it before —” 
“He’ll be all right, Mum,” said Fred. “Harry, watch us first.” 
He took a pinch of glittering powder out of the flowerpot, 
stepped up to the fi re, and threw the powd er into the flames. 
With a roar, the fire turned emer ald green and rose higher than 
Fred, who stepped right into it, shouted, “Diagon Alley!” and van-
ished. 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 48  “You must speak clearly, dear,” Mrs. Weasley told Harry as 
George dipped his hand into the flowerpot. “And be sure to get out 
at the right grate. . . .” 
“The right what?” said Harry ne rvously as the fire roared and 
whipped George out of sight, too. 
“Well, there are an awful lot of wizard fires to choose from, you 
know, but as long as you’ve spoken clearly —” 
“He’ll be fine, Molly, don’t fuss, ” said Mr. Weasley, helping him-
self to Floo powder, too. 
“But, dear, if he got lost, how would we ever explain to his aunt 
and uncle?” 
“They wouldn’t mind,” Harry reassured her. “Dudley would 
think it was a brilliant joke if I got lost up a chimney, don’t worry 
about that —” 
“Well . . . all right . . . you go after Arthur,” said Mrs. Weasley. 
“Now, when you get into the fi re, say where you’re going —” 
“And keep your elbows tucked in,” Ron advised. 
“And your eyes shut,” said Mrs. Weasley. “The soot —” 
“Don’t fidget,” said Ron. “Or you might well fa ll out of the 
wrong fireplace —” 
“But don’t panic and get out too early; wait until you see Fred 
and George.” 
Trying hard to bear all this in mind, Harry took a pinch of Floo 
powder and walked to the edge of the fire. He took a deep breath, 
scattered the powder into the flam es, and stepped forward; the fire 
felt like a warm breeze; he opened his mouth and immediately 
swallowed a lot of hot ash. 
“D-Dia-gon Alley,” he coughed. 
 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 49  It felt as though he were bein g sucked down a gi ant drain. He 
seemed to be spinning very fast — the roaring in his ears was deaf-
ening — he tried to keep his ey es open but the whirl of green 
flames made him feel sick — something hard knocked his elbow 
and he tucked it in tightly, still spinning and spinning — now it 
f e l t a s t h o u g h c o l d h a n d s w e r e slapping his face — squinting 
through his glasses he saw a blur red stream of fireplaces and 
snatched glimpses of the rooms beyond — his bacon sandwiches 
were churning inside him — he closed his eyes again wishing it 
would stop, and then — 
He fell, face forward, onto cold stone and felt the bridge of his 
glasses snap. 
Dizzy and bruised, covered in soot , he got gingerly to his feet, 
holding his broken glasses up to his eyes. He was quite alone, but 
where he was, he had no idea. All he could tell was that he was 
standing in the stone fireplace of what looked like a large, dimly lit 
wizard’s shop — but nothing in he re was ever likely to be on a 
Hogwarts school list. 
A glass case nearby held a wither ed hand on a cushion, a blood-
stained pack of cards, and a star ing glass eye. Evil-looking masks 
stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay 
upon the counter, and rusty, sp iked instruments hung from the 
ceiling. Even worse, the dark , narrow street Harry could see 
through the dusty shop window wa s definitely not Diagon Alley. 
The sooner he got out of here, the better. Nose still stinging 
where it had hit the hearth, Harry made his way swiftly and silently 
toward the door, but before he’d got halfway toward it, two people appeared on the other side of the glass — and one of them was the 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 50  very last person Harry wanted to meet when he was lost, covered in 
soot, and wearing broken glasses: Draco Malfoy. 
Harry looked quickly around and spotted a large black cabinet 
to his left; he shot inside it an d pulled the doors closed, leaving a 
small crack to peer thro ugh. Seconds later, a bell clanged, and Mal-
foy stepped into the shop. 
The man who followed could only be Draco’s father. He had the 
same pale, pointed face and identical cold, gray eyes. Mr. Malfoy 
crossed the shop, looking lazily at the items on display, and rang a 
bell on the counter before turning to his son and saying, “Touch nothing, Draco.” 
Malfoy, who had reached for the gl ass eye, said, “I thought you 
were going to buy me a present.” 
“I said I would buy you a racing broom,” said his father, drum-
ming his fingers on the counter. 
“What’s the good of that if I’m not on the House team?” said 
Malfoy, looking sulky and bad- tempered. “Harry Potter got a 
Nimbus Two Thousand last year. Special permission from Dum-
bledore so he could play for Gryf findor. He’s not even that good, 
it’s just because he’s famous . . . famous for having a stupid scar on 
his forehead. . . .” 
Malfoy bent down to examin e a shelf full of skulls. 
“. . . everyone thinks he’s so smart, wonderful Potter with his scar 
and his broomstick —” 
“You have told me this at leas t a dozen times already,” said Mr. 
Malfoy, with a quelling look at his son. “And I would remind you 
that it is not — prudent — to appear less than fond of Harry Pot-ter, not when most of our kind re gard him as the hero who made 
the Dark Lord disappea r — ah, Mr. Borgin.” 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 51  A stooping man had ap peared behind the counter, smoothing 
his greasy hair ba ck from his face. 
“Mr. Malfoy, what a pleasure to see you again,” said Mr. Borgin 
in a voice as oily as his hair. “Delighted — and young Master Mal-
foy, too — charmed. How may I be of assistance? I must show you, 
just in today, and very reasonably priced —” 
“I’m not buying today, Mr. Borgin, but selling,” said Mr. Mal-
foy. 
“Selling?” The smile faded slig htly from Mr. Borgin’s face. 
“You have heard, of course, th at the Ministry is conducting 
more raids,” said Mr. Malfoy, taki ng a roll of parchment from his 
inside pocket and unraveling it for Mr. Borgin to read. “I have a 
few — ah — items at home that might embarrass me, if the Min-
istry were to call. . . .” 
Mr. Borgin fixed a pair of pinc e-nez to his nose and looked 
down the list. 
“The Ministry wouldn’t presume to trouble you, sir, surely?” 
Mr. Malfoy’s lip curled. 
“I have not been visited yet. Th e name Malfoy still commands a 
certain respect, yet the Ministry grows ever more meddlesome. 
There are rumors about a new Mu ggle Protection Act — no doubt 
that flea-bitten, Muggle-loving fool Arthur Weasley is behind 
it —” 
Harry felt a hot surge of anger. 
“— and as you see, certain of these poisons might make it ap-
pear —” 
“I understand, sir, of course,” sa id Mr. Borgin. “Let me see . . .” 
“Can I have that?” interrupted Draco, pointing at the withered 
hand on its cushion. 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 52  “Ah, the Hand of Glory!” said Mr. Borgin, abandoning Mr. 
Malfoy’s list and scurrying over to Draco. “Insert a candle and it 
gives light only to the holder! Best friend of thieves and plunderers! 
Your son has fine taste, sir.” 
“I hope my son will amount to mo re than a thief or a plunderer, 
Borgin,” said Mr. Malfoy coldly, and Mr. Borgin said quickly, “No 
offense, sir, no offense meant —” 
“Though if his grades don’t pick up,” said Mr. Malfoy, more 
coldly still, “that may indeed be all he is fit for —” 
“It’s not my fault,” retorted Drac o. “The teachers all have fa-
vorites, that Hermione Granger —” 
“I would have thought you’d be ashamed that a girl of no wizard 
family beat you in every exam,” snapped Mr. Malfoy. 
“Ha!” said Harry under his breath , pleased to see Draco looking 
both abashed and angry. 
“It’s the same all over,” said Mr. Borgin, in his oily voice. “Wiz-
ard blood is counting for less everywhere —” 
“Not with me,” said Mr. Malfoy , his long nost rils flaring. 
“No, sir, nor with me, sir,” said Mr. Borgin, with a deep bow. 
“In that case, perhaps we can return to my list,” said Mr. Malfoy 
shortly. “I am in something of a hurry, Borgin, I have important business elsewhere today —” 
They started to haggle. Harry watched nervously as Draco drew 
nearer and nearer to his hiding place, examining the objects for sale. Draco paused to examine a long coil of hangman’s rope and to 
read, smirking, the card propped on a magnificent necklace of 
opals, Caution: Do Not Touch. Cursed — Has Claimed the Lives of 
Nineteen Muggle Owners to Date. 
 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 53  Draco turned away and saw the ca binet right in front of him. He 
walked forward — he stretched out his hand for the handle — 
“Done,” said Mr. Malfoy at the counter. “Come, Draco —” 
Harry wiped his forehead on his sleeve as Draco turned away. 
“Good day to you, Mr. Borgin. I’ ll expect you at the manor to-
morrow to pick up the goods.” 
The moment the door had closed, Mr. Borgin dropped his oily 
manner. 
“Good day yourself, Mister Malfoy, and if th e stories are true, 
you haven’t sold me half of what’s hidden in your manor. . . .” 
Muttering darkly, Mr. Borgin di sappeared into a back room. 
Harry waited for a minute in case he came back, then, quietly as he 
could, slipped out of the cabinet, pa st the glass cases, and out of the 
shop door. 
Clutching his broken glasses to his face, Harry stared around. 
He had emerged into a dingy alleyw ay that seemed to be made up 
entirely of shops devoted to the Da rk Arts. The one he’d just left, 
Borgin and Burkes, looked like the largest, but opposite was a nasty 
window display of shrunken head s and, two doors down, a large 
cage was alive with gigantic black spiders. Two shabby-looking wiz-
ards were watching him from th e shadow of a doorway, muttering 
to each other. Feeling jumpy, Ha rry set off, trying to hold his 
glasses on straight and hoping against hope he’d be able to find a 
way out of here. 
An old wooden street sign hanging over a shop selling poiso-
nous candles told him he was in Knockturn Alley. This didn’t 
help, as Harry had never heard of such a place. He supposed he hadn’t spoken clearly enough th rough his mouthful of ashes 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 54  back in the Weasleys’ fi re. Trying to stay ca lm, he wondered what 
to do. 
“Not lost are you, my dear?” said a voice in his ear, making him 
jump. 
An aged witch stood in front of him, holding a tray of what 
looked horribly like whole human fingernails. She leered at him, 
showing mossy teeth. Harry backed away. 
“I’m fine, thanks,” he said. “I’m just —” 
“HARRY! What d’yeh thin k yer doin’ down there?” 
Harry’s heart leapt. So did the wi tch; a load of fingernails cas-
caded down over her feet and she cursed as the massive form of 
Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper , came striding toward them, 
beetle-black eyes flashing over his great bristling beard. 
“Hagrid!” Harry croaked in reli ef. “I was lost — Floo pow-
der —” 
Hagrid seized Harry by the scru ff of the neck and pulled him 
away from the witch, knocking the tray right out of her hands. Her 
shrieks followed them all the way along the twisting alleyway out 
into bright sunlight. Harry saw a familiar, snow-white marble 
building in the distance — Grin gotts Bank. Hagrid had steered 
him right into Diagon Alley. 
“Yer a mess!” said Hagrid gruffly, brushing soot off Harry so 
forcefully he nearly knocked him in to a barrel of dragon dung out-
side an apothecary. “Skulkin’ around Knockturn Alley, I dunno — 
dodgy place, Harry — don’ want no one ter see yeh down there —” 
“I realized that,” said Harry, ducking as Hagrid made to brush 
him off again. “I told you, I was lost — what were you doing down there, anyway?” 
 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 55  “I was lookin’ fer a Flesh-Eatin’ Slug Repellent ,” growled Ha-
grid. “They’re ruinin’ the school cabbages. Yer not on yer own?” 
“I’m staying with the Weasleys but we got separated,” Harry ex-
plained. “I’ve got to go and find them. . . .” 
They set off together down the street. 
“How come yeh never wrote back ter me?” said Hagrid as Harry 
jogged alongside him (he had to take three steps to every stride of 
Hagrid’s enormous bo ots). Harry explained all about Dobby and 
the Dursleys. 
“Lousy Muggles,” growled Hagrid. “If I’d’ve known —” 
“Harry! Harry! Over here!” Harry looked up and saw Hermione Granger standing at the top 
of the white flight of steps to Gringotts. She ran down to meet 
them, her bushy brown ha ir flying behind her. 
“What happened to your glasses? Hello, Hagrid — Oh, it’s 
wonderful to see you two again — Are you coming into Gringotts, 
Harry?” 
“As soon as I’ve found the Weasleys,” said Harry. 
“Yeh won’t have long ter wait,” Hagrid said with a grin. 
Harry and Hermione looked arou nd: Sprinting up the crowded 
street were Ron, Fred, Geor ge, Percy, and Mr. Weasley. 
“Harry,” Mr. Weasley panted. “We hoped you’d only gone one 
grate too far. . . .” He mopped his glistening bald patch. “Molly’s 
frantic — she’s coming now —” 
“Where did you come out?” Ron asked. 
“Knockturn Alley,” said Hagrid grimly. “Excellent !” said Fred and George together. 
“We’ve never been allowed in,” said Ron enviously. 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 56  “I should ruddy well th ink not,” growled Hagrid. 
Mrs. Weasley now came gallopin g into view, her handbag swing-
ing wildly in one hand, Ginny ju st clinging onto the other. 
“ O h , H a r r y — o h , m y d e a r — y o u c o u l d h a v e b e e n a n y -
where —” 
Gasping for breath she pulled a large clothes brush out of her 
bag and began sweeping off the s oot Hagrid hadn’t managed to 
beat away. Mr. Weasley to ok Harry’s glasses, ga ve them a tap of his 
wand, and returned them, good as new. 
“Well, gotta be off,” said Ha grid, who was having his hand 
wrung by Mrs. Weasle y (“Knockturn Alley! If you hadn’t found 
him, Hagrid!”). “See yer at Hogwarts!” And he strode away, head 
and shoulders taller than anyone else in the packed street. 
“Guess who I saw in Borgin an d Burkes?” Harry asked Ron and 
Hermione as they climbed the Grin gotts steps. “Malfoy and his fa-
ther.” 
“Did Lucius Malfoy buy anything?” said Mr. Weasley sharply 
behind them. 
“No, he was selling —” 
“So he’s worried,” said Mr. Weasley with grim satisfaction. “Oh, 
I’d love to get Lucius Malfoy for something. . . .” 
“You be careful, Arthur,” said Mr s. Weasley sharply as they were 
bowed into the bank by a goblin at the door. “That family’s trou-
ble. Don’t go biting off mo re than you can chew —” 
“So you don’t think I’m a match for Lucius Malfoy?” said Mr. 
Weasley indignantly, but he was distracted almost at once by the 
sight of Hermione’s parents, who were standing nervously at the 
counter that ran all along the great marble hall, waiting for 
Hermione to in troduce them. 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 57  “But you’re Muggles !” said Mr. Weasley delightedly. “We must 
have a drink! What’s that you’ve got there? Oh, you’re changing 
Muggle money. Molly, look!” He pointed excite dly at the ten-
pound notes in Mr. Granger’s hand. 
“Meet you back here,” Ron said to Hermione as the Weasleys 
and Harry were led off to their underground vaults by another 
Gringotts goblin. 
The vaults were reached by means of small, goblin-driven carts 
that sped along minature train tracks through the bank’s under-
ground tunnels. Harry enjoyed the breakneck journey down to the Weasleys’ vault, but felt dreadful, far worse than he had in Knock-turn Alley, when it was opened. There was a very small pile of sil-
ver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt 
right into the corners before sweep ing the whole lot into her bag. 
Harry felt even worse when they reached his vault. He tried to 
block the contents from view as he hastily shoved ha ndfuls of coins 
into a leather bag. 
Back outside on the marble steps, they all separated. Percy mut-
tered vaguely about needing a new quill. Fred and George had 
spotted their friend from Hogwarts, Lee Jordan. Mrs. Weasley and 
Ginny were going to a secondhand robe shop. Mr. Weasley was in-
sisting on taking the Grangers off to the Leaky Cauldron for a 
drink. 
“We’ll all meet at Flourish and Blotts in an hour to buy your 
schoolbooks,” said Mrs. Weasley, setting off with Ginny. “And not one step down Knockturn Alley!” sh e shouted at the twins’ retreat-
ing backs. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione strolled off along the winding, cob-
bled street. The bag of gold, silver , and bronze jangling cheerfully 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 58  in Harry’s pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three 
large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped 
happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating 
shop windows. Ron gazed longingl y at a full set of Chudley Can-
non robes in the windows of Qu ality Quidditch Supplies until 
Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. 
In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Jo ke Shop, they met Fred, George, 
and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster’s Fabulous 
Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of bro-ken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion 
stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply 
boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power. 
“A study of Hogwarts prefects and their later careers, ” Ron read 
aloud off the back co ver. “That sounds fascinating. . . .” 
“Go away,” Percy snapped. 
“ ’Course, he’s very ambitious, Pe rcy, he’s got it all planned 
out. . . . He wants to be Minister of Magic . . .” Ron told Harry 
and Hermione in an undertone as they left Percy to it. 
An hour later, they headed for Flourish and Blotts. They were by 
no means the only ones making th eir way to the bookshop. As they 
approached it, they saw to their surprise a large crowd jostling out-
side the doors, trying to get in. Th e reason for this was proclaimed 
by a large banner stretched across the upper windows: 
 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
will be signing copies of his autobiography 
MAGICAL ME 
today 12:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. 
 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 59  “We can actually meet him!” He rmione squealed. “I mean, he’s 
written almost the whole booklist!” 
The crowd seemed to be made up mostly of witches around 
Mrs. Weasley’s age. A harassed-l ooking wizard stood at the door, 
saying, “Calmly, please, ladies. . . . Don’t push, there . . . mind the 
books, now. . . .” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione squeezed inside. A long line wound 
right to the back of the shop, where Gilderoy Lockhart was signing his books. They each grabbed a copy of The Standard Book of Spells, 
Grade 2 and sneaked up the line to wh ere the rest of the Weasleys 
were standing with Mr. and Mrs. Granger. 
“Oh, there you are, good,” said Mrs. Weasley. She sounded 
breathless and kept patting her hair. “We’ll be able to see him in a minute. . . .” 
Gilderoy Lockhart came slowly into view, seated at a table 
surrounded by large pictures of his own face, all winking and flashing dazzlingly white teeth at the crowd. The real Lockhart 
was wearing robes of forget-me-not blue that exactly matched his 
eyes; his pointed wizard’s hat was set at a jaunty angle on his wavy 
hair. 
A short, irritable-looking man was dancing around taking pho-
tographs with a large black camera that emitted puffs of purple 
smoke with every blinding flash. 
“Out of the way, there,” he snarled at Ron, moving back to get a 
better shot. “This is for the Daily Prophet —” 
“Big deal,” said Ron, rubbing his foot where the photographer 
had stepped on it. 
Gilderoy Lockhart heard him. He looked up. He saw Ron — 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 60  and then he saw Harry. He star ed. Then he leapt to his feet and 
positively shouted, “It can’t be Harry Potter?” 
The crowd parted, whispering ex citedly; Lockhart dived for-
ward, seized Harry’s arm, and pull ed him to the front. The crowd 
burst into applause. Harry’s face burned as Lockhart shook his 
hand for the photographer, who wa s clicking away madly, wafting 
thick smoke over the Weasleys. 
“Nice big smile, Harry,” said Lockhart, through his own gleam-
ing teeth. “Together, you and I are worth the front page.” 
When he finally let go of Harry’s hand, Harry could hardly feel 
his fingers. He tried to sidle back over to the Weasleys, but Lock-
hart threw an arm around his shou lders and clamped him tightly to 
his side. 
“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said loudly, waving for quiet. “What 
an extraordinary moment this is ! The perfect moment for me to 
make a little announcement I’ve been sitting on for some time! 
“When young Harry here stepped into Flourish and Blotts to-
day, he only wanted to buy my autobiography — which I shall 
be happy to present him now, free of charge —” The crowd 
applauded again. “He had no idea, ” Lockhart continued, giving 
Harry a little shake that made his glasses slip to the end of his nose, 
“that he would shortly be getting much, much more than my book, 
Magical Me. He and his schoolmates will, in fact, be getting the real 
magical me. Yes, ladies and gentle men, I have great pleasure and 
pride in announcing that this Sept ember, I will be taking up the 
post of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!” 
The crowd cheered and clapped and Harry found himself being 
 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 61  presented with the entire works of Gilderoy Lockhart. Staggering 
slightly under their weight, he managed to make his way out of the 
limelight to the edge of the room , where Ginny was standing next 
to her new cauldron. 
“You have these,” Harry mumbled to her, tipping the books into 
the cauldron. “I’ll buy my own —” 
“Bet you loved that, didn’t you, Potter?” said a voice Harry had 
no trouble recognizing. He stra ightened up and found himself 
face-to-face with Draco Malfoy, who was wearing his usual sneer. 
“Famous Harry Potter,” said Malfoy. “Can’t even go into a book-
shop without making the front page.” 
“Leave him alone, he didn’t want all that!” said Ginny. It was the 
first time she had spoken in front of Harry. She was glaring at Mal-foy. 
“Potter, you’ve got yourself a girlfriend !” drawled Malfoy. Ginny 
went scarlet as Ron and Hermio ne fought their way over, both 
clutching stacks of Lockhart’s books. 
“Oh, it’s you,” said Ron, looking at Malfoy as if he were some-
thing unpleasant on the sole of his shoe. “Bet you’re surprised to see 
Harry here, eh?” 
“Not as surprised as I am to see you in a shop, Weasley,” retorted 
Malfoy. “I suppose your parents will go hungry for a month to pay 
for all those.” 
Ron went as red as Ginny. He dr opped his books into the caul-
dron, too, and started toward Malfoy, but Harry and Hermione 
grabbed the back of his jacket. 
“Ron!” said Mr. Weasley, struggl ing over with Fred and George. 
“What are you doing? It’s too crowded in here, let’s go outside.” 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 62  “Well, well, well — Arthur Weasley.” 
It was Mr. Malfoy. He stood with his hand on Draco’s shoulder, 
sneering in just the same way. 
“Lucius,” said Mr. Weasley, nodding coldly. 
“Busy time at the Ministry, I hear,” said Mr. Malfoy. “All those 
raids . . . I hope they’r e paying you overtime?” 
He reached into Ginny’s cauldron and extracted, from amid the 
glossy Lockhart books, a very old, very battered copy of A Begin-
ner’s Guide to Transfiguration. 
“Obviously not,” Mr. Malfoy said. “Dear me, what’s the use of 
being a disgrace to the name of wizard if they don’t even pay you 
well for it?” 
Mr. Weasley flushed darker th an either Ron or Ginny. 
“We have a very different idea of what disgraces the name of wiz-
ard, Malfoy,” he said. 
“Clearly,” said Mr. Malfoy, his pale eyes straying to Mr. and 
Mrs. Granger, who were watching apprehensively. “The company 
you keep, Weasley . . . and I thought your fa mily could sink no 
lower —” 
There was a thud of metal as Gi nny’s cauldron went flying; Mr. 
Weasley had thrown himself at Mr. Malfoy, knocking him back-
ward into a bookshelf. Dozens of heavy spellbooks came thunder-
ing down on all their heads; ther e was a yell of, “Get him, Dad!” 
from Fred or George; Mrs. Weas ley was shrieking, “No, Arthur, 
no!”; the crowd stampeded backward , knocking more shelves over; 
“Gentlemen, please — please!” crie d the assistant, and then, louder 
than all — 
“Break it up, there, ge nts, break it up —” 
 
AT FLOURISH AND BLOTTS 
 63  Hagrid was wading toward them through the sea of books. In 
an instant he had pulled Mr. Weasley and Mr. Malfoy apart. 
Mr. Weasley had a cut lip and Mr. Malfoy had been hit in the eye 
by an Encyclopedia of Toadstools. He was still ho lding Ginny’s old 
Transfiguration book. He thrust it at her, his eyes glittering with 
malice. 
“Here, girl — take your book — it’s the best your father can 
give you —” Pulling himself out of Hagrid’s grip he beckoned to 
Draco and swept from the shop. 
“Yeh should’ve ignored him, Arthur,” said Hagrid, almost lifting 
Mr. Weasley off his feet as he straig htened his robes. “Rotten ter the 
core, the whole family, everyone knows that — no Malfoy’s worth 
listenin’ ter — bad blood, that’s what it is — come on now — let’s get outta here.” 
The assistant looked as though h e w a n t e d t o s t o p t h e m f r o m 
leaving, but he barely came up to Hagrid’s waist and seemed to think better of it. They hurried up the street, the Grangers shaking 
with fright and Mrs. Weasle y beside herself with fury. 
“A fine example to set for your children . . . brawling in pub-
lic . . . what Gilderoy Lockhart must’ve thought —” 
“He was pleased,” said Fred. “Didn’t you hear him as we were 
leaving? He was asking that bloke from the Daily Prophet if he’d be 
able to work the fight into his repo rt — said it was all publicity —” 
But it was a subdued group that headed back to the fireside in 
the Leaky Cauldron, where Harry, the Weasleys, and all their shop-
ping would be traveling back to the Burrow using Floo powder. 
They said good-bye to the Grange rs, who were leaving the pub for 
the Muggle street on the other side; Mr. Weasley started to ask 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 64  them how bus stops worked, but st opped quickly at the look on 
Mrs. Weasley’s face. 
Harry took off his glasses and put them safely in his pocket be-
fore helping himself to Floo powder. It definitely wasn’t his favorite 
way to travel.

he end of the summer vacation came too quickly for Harry’s 
liking. He was looking forward to getting back to Hogwarts, 
but his month at the Burrow had be en the happiest of his life. It 
was difficult not to feel jealous of Ron when he thought of the 
Dursleys and the sort of welcome he could expect next time he 
turned up on Privet Drive. 
On their last evening, Mrs. Weasley conjured up a sumptuous 
dinner that included all of Harry’s favorite things, ending with a 
mouthwatering treacle pudding. Fred and George rounded off the evening with a display of Filibuster fireworks; they filled the 
kitchen with red and bl ue stars that bounced from ceiling to wall 
for at least half an hour. Then it was time for a last mug of hot 
chocolate and bed. 
It took a long while to get star ted next morning. They were up 
at dawn, but somehow they still seem ed to have a great deal to do. 
 T 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 66  Mrs. Weasley dashed about in a bad mood looking for spare socks 
and quills; people kept colliding on the stairs, half-dressed with bits 
of toast in their hands; and Mr. Weasley nearly broke his neck, trip-
ping over a stray chic ken as he crossed the yard carrying Ginny’s 
trunk to the car. 
Harry couldn’t see how eight people, six large trunks, two owls, 
and a rat were going to fit into one small Ford Anglia. He had reck-
oned, of course, without the specia l features that Mr. Weasley had 
added. 
“Not a word to Molly,” he whispered to Harry as he opened the 
trunk and showed him how it had been magically expanded so that 
the luggage fitted easily. 
When at last they were all in the car, Mrs. Weasley glanced into 
the back seat, where Harry, Ron, Fred, George, and Percy were all 
sitting comfortably side by side, and said, “Muggles do know more 
than we give them credit for, don ’t they?” She and Ginny got into the front seat, which had been stretc hed so that it resembled a park 
bench. “I mean, you’d never know it was this roomy from the out-
side, would you?” 
Mr. Weasley started up the engine and they trundled out of the 
yard, Harry turning back for a last look at the house. He barely had 
time to wonder when he’d see it again when they were back — 
George had forgotten his box of Filibuster fireworks. Five minutes after that, they skidded to a halt in the yard so that Fred could run 
in for his broomstick. They had almost reached the highway when 
Ginny shrieked that she’d left her diary. By the time she had clam-
bered back into the car, they were running very late, and tempers 
were running high. 
 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 67  Mr. Weasley glanced at his wa tch and then at his wife. 
“Molly, dear —” 
“No, Arthur —” 
“No one would see — this little button here is an Invisibility 
Booster I installed — that’d get us u p i n t h e a i r — t h e n w e f l y 
above the clouds. We’d be there in ten minutes and no one would 
be any the wiser —” 
“I said no, Arthur, not in broad daylight —” 
They reached King’s Cross at a quarter to eleven. Mr. Weasley 
dashed across the road to get trolle ys for their trun ks and they all 
hurried into the station. 
Harry had caught the Hogwarts Express the previous year. The 
tricky part was getting onto pl atform nine and three-quarters, 
which wasn’t visible to the Muggl e eye. What you had to do was 
walk through the solid barrier dividing platfo rms nine and ten. It 
didn’t hurt, but it had to be done carefully so that none of the Muggles noticed you vanishing. 
“Percy first,” said Mrs. Weasley, looking nervously at the clock 
overhead, which showed they had only five minutes to disappear 
casually through the barrier. 
Percy strode briskly forward and vanished. Mr. Weasley went 
next; Fred and George followed. 
“I’ll take Ginny and you two come right after us,” Mrs. Weasley 
told Harry and Ron, grabbing Ginny’s hand and setting off. In the 
blink of an eye they were gone. 
“Let’s go together, we’ve only got a minute,” Ron said to Harry. 
Harry made sure that Hedwig’s cage was safely wedged on top of 
his trunk and wheeled his trolley around to face the barrier. He felt 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 68  perfectly confident; this wasn’t nearly as uncomfortable as using 
Floo powder. Both of them bent lo w over the handles of their trol-
leys and walked purposefully toward the barrier, gathering speed. A 
few feet away from it, th ey broke into a run and — 
CRASH. Both trolleys hit the barrier and bounced backward; Ron’s trunk 
fell off with a loud thump, Ha rry was knocked off his feet, and 
Hedwig’s cage bounced onto the shiny floor, and she rolled away, shrieking indignantly; people all around them stared and a guard 
nearby yelled, “What in blazes d’you think you’re doing?” 
“Lost control of the trolley,” Harry gasped, clutching his ribs as 
he got up. Ron ran to pick up Hedwig, who was causing such a scene that there was a lot of mu ttering about cruelty to animals 
from the surrounding crowd. 
“Why can’t we get through?” Harry hissed to Ron. 
“I dunno —” Ron looked wildly around. A doz en curious people were still 
watching them. 
“We’re going to miss the train,” Ron whispered. “I don’t under-
stand why the gateway’ s sealed itself —” 
Harry looked up at the giant clock with a sickening feeling in 
the pit of his stomach. Ten se conds . . . nine seconds . . . 
He wheeled his trolley forward cautiously until it was right 
against the barrier and pushed wi th all his might. The metal re-
mained solid. 
Three seconds . . . two seconds . . . one second . . . “It’s gone,” said Ron, sounding stunned. “The train’s left. What 
if Mum and Dad can’t get back through to us? Have you got any 
Muggle money?” 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 69  Harry gave a hollow laugh. “The Dursleys haven’t given me 
pocket money for about six years.” 
Ron pressed his ear to the cold barrier. 
“Can’t hear a thing,” he said tens ely. “What’re we going to do? I 
don’t know how long it’ll take Mum and Dad to get back to us.” 
They looked around. People we re still watching them, mainly 
because of Hedwig’s co ntinuing screeches. 
“I think we’d better go and wait by the car,” said Harry. “We’re 
attracting too much atten —” 
“Harry!” said Ron, his ey es gleaming. “The car!” 
“What about it?” “We can fly the car to Hogwarts!” 
“But I thought —” 
“We’re stuck, right? And we’ve got to get to school, haven’t we? 
And even underage wizards are allo wed to use magic if it’s a real 
emergency, section nineteen or so mething of the Restriction of 
Thingy —” 
“But your mum and dad . . .” said Harry, pushing against the 
barrier again in the vain hope th at it would give way. “How will 
they get home?” 
“They don’t need the car!” said Ron impatiently. “They know 
how to Apparate! You know, just vanish and reappear at home! 
They only bother with Floo powd er and the car because we’re all 
underage and we’re not allowe d to Apparate yet. . . .” 
Harry’s feeling of panic turn ed suddenly to excitement. 
“Can you fly it?” “No problem,” said Ron, wheeling his trolley around to face the 
exit. “C’mon, let’s go. If we hurry we’ll be able to follow the Hog-
warts Express —” 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 70  And they marched off through the crowd of curious Muggles, 
out of the station and back onto the side road where the old Ford 
Anglia was parked. 
Ron unlocked the cavernous trunk wi th a series of taps from his 
wand. They heaved their luggage ba ck in, put Hedwig on the back 
seat, and got into the front. 
“Check that no one’s watching,” said Ron, st arting the ignition 
with another tap of his wand. Harr y stuck his head out of the win-
dow: Traffic was rumbling along th e main road ahead, but their 
street was empty. 
“Okay,” he said. 
Ron pressed a tiny silver button on the dashboard. The car 
around them vanished — and so di d they. Harry could feel the seat 
vibrating beneath him, hear the en gine, feel his hands on his knees 
and his glasses on his nose, but for all he could see, he had become 
a pair of eyeballs, floating a few feet above the ground in a dingy street full of parked cars. 
“Let’s go,” said Ron’s voice from his right. 
And the ground and the dirty buildi ngs on either side fell away, 
dropping out of sight as the car ro se; in seconds, the whole of Lon-
don lay, smoky and gl ittering, below them. 
Then there was a popping noise and the car, Harry, and Ron 
reappeared. 
“Uh-oh,” said Ron, jabbing at the Invisibility Booster. “It’s 
faulty —” 
Both of them pummeled it. The car vanished. Then it flickered 
back again. 
“Hold on!” Ron yelled, and he slammed his foot on the acceler- 
 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 71  ator; they shot straight into the low, woolly clouds and everything 
turned dull and foggy. 
“ N o w w h a t ? ” s a i d H a r r y , b l i n k i ng at the solid mass of cloud 
pressing in on them from all sides. 
“We need to see the train to know what direction to go in,” said 
Ron. 
“Dip back down again — quickly —” 
They dropped back beneath the clouds and twisted around in 
their seats, squint ing at the ground. 
“I can see it!” Harry yelled. “Right ahead — there!” 
The Hogwarts Express was streak ing along below them like a 
scarlet snake. 
“Due north,” said Ron, checking the compass on the dashboard. 
“Okay, we’ll just have to check on it every half hour or so — hold 
on —” 
And they shot up through the clouds. A minute later, they burst 
out into a blaze of sunlight. 
It was a different world. The wh eels of the car skimmed the sea 
of fluffy cloud, the sky a bright , endless blue under the blinding 
white sun. 
“All we’ve got to worry about now are airplanes,” said Ron. 
They looked at each other and started to laugh; for a long time, 
they couldn’t stop. 
It was as though they had been plunged into a fabulous dream. 
This, thought Harry, was surely th e only way to travel — past 
swirls and turrets of sn owy cloud, in a car full of hot, bright sun-
light, with a fat pack of toffees in the glove compartment, and the 
prospect of seeing Fred’s and George’s jealous faces when they 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 72  landed smoothly and sp ectacularly on the sweeping lawn in front 
of Hogwarts castle. 
They made regular chec ks on the train as they flew farther and 
farther north, each dip beneath the clouds showing them a dif-
ferent view. London was soon far behind them, replaced by neat 
green fields that gave way in turn to wide, purplish moors, a great 
city alive with cars like multicolored ants, villages with tiny toy 
churches. 
Several uneventful hours later, ho wever, Harry had to admit that 
some of the fun was wearing off. The toffees had made them ex-
tremely thirsty and they had nothing to drink. He and Ron had pulled off their sweaters, but Har ry’s T-shirt was sticking to the 
back of his seat and his glasses ke pt sliding down to the end of his 
sweaty nose. He had stopped noticing the fantastic cloud shapes 
now and was thinking longingly of the train miles below, where 
you could buy ice-cold pumpkin ju ice from a trolley pushed by a 
plump witch. Why hadn’t they been able to get onto platform nine 
and three-quarters? 
“Can’t be much further, can it?” croaked Ron, hours later still, as 
the sun started to sink into their fl oor of cloud, staining it a deep 
pink. “Ready for another check on the train?” 
It was still right below them, winding its way past a snowcapped 
mountain. It was much darker beneath the canopy of clouds. 
Ron put his foot on the accele rator and drove them upward 
again, but as he did so, th e engine began to whine. 
Harry and Ron exchange d nervous glances. 
“It’s probably just tired,” said Ro n. “It’s never been this far be-
fore. . . .” 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 73  And they both pretended not to notice the whining growing 
louder and louder as the sky became steadily darker. Stars were 
blossoming in the blac kness. Harry pulled his sweater back on, try-
ing to ignore the way the windshie ld wipers were now waving fee-
bly, as though in protest. 
“Not far,” said Ron, more to the car than to Harry, “not far 
now,” and he patted th e dashboard nervously. 
When they flew back beneath the cl ouds a little while later, they 
had to squint through the darkne ss for a landmark they knew. 
“There !” Harry shouted, making Ron and Hedwig jump. 
“Straight ahead!” 
Silhouetted on the dark horizon, high on the cliff over the lake, 
stood the many turrets and to wers of Hogwarts castle. 
But the car had begun to sh udder and was losing speed. 
“Come on,” Ron said cajolingly, giving the steering wheel a lit-
tle shake, “nearly there, come on —” 
The engine groaned. Narrow jets of steam were issuing from un-
der the hood. Harry found himself gripping the edges of his seat 
very hard as they fl ew toward the lake. 
The car gave a nasty wobble. Glancing out of his window, Harry 
saw the smooth, black, glassy surf ace of the water, a mile below. 
Ron’s knuckles were white on th e steering wheel. The car wobbled 
again. 
“Come on,” Ron muttered. 
They were over the lake — th e castle was right ahead — Ron 
put his foot down. 
There was a loud clunk, a splu tter, and the engine died com-
pletely. 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 74  “Uh-oh,” said Ron, into the silence. 
The nose of the car dropped. They were falling, gathering speed, 
heading straight for th e solid castle wall. 
“Noooooo !” Ron yelled, swinging the steering wheel around; they 
missed the dark stone wall by inches as the car turned in a great arc, 
soaring over the dark greenhouses , then the vegetable patch, and 
then out over the bl ack lawns, losing altitude all the time. 
Ron let go of the steering wheel completely and pulled his wand 
out of his back pocket — 
“STOP! STOP!” he yelled, wh acking the dashboard and the 
windshield, but they were still pl ummeting, the ground flying up 
toward them — 
“WATCH OUT FOR THAT TREE!” Harry bellowed, lunging 
for the steering wheel, but too late — 
CRUNCH. With an earsplitting bang of metal on wood, they hit the thick 
tree trunk and dropped to the grou nd with a heavy jolt. Steam was 
billowing from under the crumpled hood; Hedwig was shrieking in 
terror; a golf-ball-sized lump wa s throbbing on Harry’s head where 
he had hit the windshield; and to his right, Ron let out a low, de-
spairing groan. 
“Are you okay?” Ha rry said urgently. 
“My wand,” said Ron, in a shaky voice. “Look at my wand —” 
It had snapped, almost in two; the tip was dangling limply, held 
on by a few splinters. 
Harry opened his mouth to say he was sure they’d be able to 
mend it up at the school, but he ne ver even got started. At that very 
moment, something hit his side of the car with the force of a 
 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 75  charging bull, sending him lurching sideways into Ron, just as an 
equally heavy blow hit the roof. 
“What’s happen — ?” 
Ron gasped, staring through the windshield, and Harry looked 
around just in time to see a branch as thick as a python smash into 
it. The tree they had hit was atta cking them. Its trunk was bent al-
most double, and its gnarled boughs were pummeling every inch of 
the car it could reach. 
“Aaargh!” said Ron as another twisted limb punched a large dent 
into his door; the windshield wa s now trembling under a hail of 
blows from knuckle-like twigs and a branch as thick as a battering 
ram was pounding furiously on th e roof, which seemed to be cav-
ing — 
“Run for it!” Ron shouted, throwi ng his full weight against his 
door, but next second he had been knocked backward into Harry’s 
lap by a vicious uppercut from another branch. 
“We’re done for!” he moaned as the ceiling sagged, but suddenly 
the floor of the car was vibratin g — the engine had restarted. 
“Reverse !” Harry yelled, and the car shot backwa rd; the tree was 
still trying to hit them ; they could hear its roots creaking as it al-
most ripped itself up, lashing out at them as they sp ed out of reach. 
“That,” panted Ron, “was close. Well done, car —” 
The car, however, had reached th e end of its tether. With two 
sharp clunks, the doors flew open and Harry felt his seat tip side-
ways: Next thing he knew he was sprawled on the damp ground. 
Loud thuds told him that the car was ejecting their luggage from 
the trunk; Hedwig’s cage flew through the air and burst open; she 
rose out of it with an angry screec h and sped off toward the castle 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 76  without a backward l ook. Then, dented, scratched, and steaming, 
the car rumbled off into the darkness, its rear li ghts blazing angrily. 
“Come back!” Ron yelled after it , brandishing his broken wand. 
“Dad’ll kill me!” 
But the car disappeared from view with one last snort from its 
exhaust. 
“Can you believe our luck?” said Ron miserably, bending down 
to pick up Scabbers. “Of all the trees we could’ve hit, we had to get 
one that hits back.” 
He glanced over his shoulder at the ancient tree, which was still 
flailing its branch es threateningly. 
“Come on,” said Harry wearily, “we’d better get up to the 
school. . . .” 
It wasn’t at all the triumphant arrival they had pictured. Stiff, 
cold, and bruised, they seized the ends of their trunks and began dragging them up the grassy sl ope, toward the great oak front 
doors. 
“I think the feast’s already starte d,” said Ron, dropping his trunk 
at the foot of the fron t steps and crossing quie tly to look through a 
brightly lit window. “Hey — Harry — come and look — it’s the 
Sorting!” 
Harry hurried over and, together, he and Ron peered in at the 
Great Hall. 
Innumerable candles were hovering in midair over four long, 
crowded tables, making the golden plates and goblets sparkle. 
Overhead, the bewitched ceiling, which always mirrored the sky 
outside, sparkled with stars. 
Through the forest of pointed bl ack Hogwarts hats, Harry saw a 
long line of scared-looking first years filing into the Hall. Ginny 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 77  was among them, easily visible be cause of her vivid Weasley hair. 
Meanwhile, Professor McGonagall, a bespectacled witch with her 
hair in a tight bun, was placing the famous Hogwarts Sorting Hat 
on a stool before the newcomers. 
Every year, this aged old hat, patched, frayed, and dirty, sorted 
new students into the four Ho gwarts houses (Gryffindor, Huf-
flepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytheri n). Harry well remembered putting 
it on, exactly one year ago, and waiting, petrified, for its decision as 
it muttered aloud in his ear. Fo r a few horrible seconds he had 
feared that the hat was going to put him in Slytherin, the House 
that had turned out more Dark witches and wizards than any 
other — but he had ended up in Gryffindor, along with Ron, 
Hermione, and the rest of the We asleys. Last term, Harry and Ron 
had helped Gryffindor win the House Championship, beating 
Slytherin for the first time in seven years. 
A very small, mousy-haired boy had been called forward to place 
the hat on his head. Harry’s eyes wandered past him to where Pro-
fessor Dumbledore, the headmaster, sat watching the Sorting from 
the staff table, his long silver beard and half-moon glasses shining 
brightly in the candlelight. Severa l seats along, Harry saw Gilderoy 
Lockhart, dressed in robes of aquamarine. And there at the end was 
Hagrid, huge and hair y, drinking deeply from his goblet. 
“Hang on . . .” Harry muttered to Ron. “There’s an empty chair 
at the staff table. . . . Where’s Snape?” 
Professor Severus Snape was Harry’s least favorite teacher. Harry 
also happened to be Snape’s least fa vorite student. Cruel, sarcastic, 
and disliked by everybody except the students from his own House 
(Slytherin), Snape taught Potions. 
“Maybe he’s ill!” said Ron hopefully. 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 78  “Maybe he’s left,” said Harry, “because he missed out on the De-
fense Against the Dark Arts job again !” 
“Or he might have been sacked !” said Ron enthusiastically. “I 
mean, everyone hates him —” 
“Or maybe,” said a very cold voice right behind them, “he’s 
waiting to hear why you two didn’t arrive on the school train.” 
Harry spun around. There, his bl ack robes rippling in a cold 
breeze, stood Severus Snape. He was a thin man with sallow skin, a 
hooked nose, and greasy, shoulder -length black hair, and at this 
moment, he was smiling in a way th at told Harry he and Ron were 
in very deep trouble. 
“Follow me,” said Snape. 
Not daring even to look at each other, Harry and Ron followed 
Snape up the steps into the vast, echoing entrance hall, which was 
lit with flaming torches. A delici ous smell of food was wafting from 
the Great Hall, but Snape led them away from the warmth and 
light, down a narrow stone stairc ase that led into the dungeons. 
“In!” he said, opening a door ha lfway down the cold passageway 
and pointing. 
They entered Snape’s office, shivering. The shadowy walls were 
lined with shelves of large glass ja rs, in which floated all manner of 
revolting things Harry didn ’t really want to know the name of at 
the moment. The firepl ace was dark and empt y. Snape closed the 
door and turned to look at them. 
“So,” he said softly, “the train isn’t good enough for the famous 
Harry Potter and his faithful sidekick, Weasley. Wanted to arrive 
with a bang, did we, boys?” 
“No, sir, it was the barrie r at King’s Cross, it —” 
 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 79  “Silence!” said Snape coldly. “What have you done with the 
car?” 
Ron gulped. This wasn’t the firs t time Snape had given Harry the 
impression of being able to read minds. But a moment later, he un-
derstood, as Snape unrolle d today’s issue of the Evening Prophet. 
“You were seen,” he hissed , showing them the headline: FLY-
ING FORD ANGLIA MYSTIFIES MUGGLES. He began to read 
aloud: “Two Muggles in London, convinced they saw an old car 
flying over the Post Office tower . . . at noon in Norfolk, Mrs. 
Hetty Bayliss, while hanging out her washing . . . Mr. Angus Fleet, 
of Peebles, reported to police . . . Six or seven Muggles in all. I be-
lieve your father works in the Misuse of Muggle Artifacts Office?” 
he said, looking up at Ron and sm iling still more nastily. “Dear, 
dear . . . his own son . . .” 
Harry felt as though he’d just b een walloped in the stomach by 
one of the mad tree’s larger branches. If anyone found out Mr. 
Weasley had bewitched the car . . . he hadn’t thought of that. . . . 
“I noticed, in my search of th e park, that cons iderable damage 
seems to have been done to a very valuable Whomping Willow,” 
Snape went on. 
“That tree did more damage to us than we —” Ron blurted out. 
“Silence !” snapped Snape again. “M ost unfortunately, you are 
not in my House and the decision to expel you does not rest with 
me. I shall go and fetch the people who do have that happy power. 
You will wait here.” 
Harry and Ron stared at each other, white- faced. Harry didn’t 
feel hungry anymore. He now felt extremely sick. He tried not to 
look at a large, slimy something suspended in green liquid on a 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 80  shelf behind Snape’s de sk. If Snape had gone to fetch Professor 
McGonagall, head of Gryffindor Ho use, they were hardly any bet-
ter off. She might be fairer than Snape, but she was still extremely 
strict. 
Ten minutes later, Snape returned, and sure enough it was Pro-
fessor McGonagall who accompanie d him. Harry had seen Profes-
sor McGonagall angry on several occasions, but either he had 
forgotten just how thin her mouth could go, or he had never seen 
her this angry before. She raised her wand the moment she entered; 
Harry and Ron both flinched, but she merely pointed it at the 
empty fireplace, where fl ames suddenly erupted. 
“Sit,” she said, and they both ba cked into chairs by the fire. 
“Explain,” she said, her gl asses glinting ominously. 
Ron launched into the story, starting with the barrier at the sta-
tion refusing to let them through. 
“— so we had no choice, Profe ssor, we couldn ’t get on the 
train.” 
“Why didn’t you send us a letter by owl? I believe you have an 
owl?” Professor McGonagall said coldly to Harry. 
Harry gaped at her. Now she’d said it, that seemed the obvious 
thing to have done. 
“I — I didn’t think —” 
“That,” said Professor McGonagall, “is obvious.” 
There was a knock on the office door and Snape, now looking 
happier than ever, opened it. Th ere stood the headmaster, Professor 
Dumbledore. 
Harry’s whole body went numb . Dumbledore was looking un-
usually grave. He stared down his very crooked nose at them, and 
 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 81  Harry suddenly found himself wishin g he and Ron were still being 
beaten up by the Whomping Willow. 
There was a long silence. Then Dumbledore said, “Please ex-
plain why you did this.” 
It would have been better if he had shouted. Harry hated the dis-
appointment in his voice. For some reason, he was unable to look 
Dumbledore in the eyes, and spoke instead to his knees. He told 
Dumbledore everything except th at Mr. Weasley owned the be-
witched car, making it sound as though he and Ron had happened 
to find a flying car parked outside the station. He knew Dumble-
dore would see through this at once, but Dumbledore asked no 
questions about the car. When Ha rry had finished, he merely con-
tinued to peer at them through his spectacles. 
“We’ll go and get our stuff,” said Ron in a hopeless sort of voice. 
“What are you talking about, We asley?” barked Professor Mc-
Gonagall. 
“Well, you’re expelling us , aren’t you?” said Ron. 
Harry looked quickly at Dumbledore. 
“Not today, Mr. Weasley,” said Dumbledore. “But I must im-
press upon both of yo u the seriousness of wh at you have done. I 
will be writing to both your families tonight. I must also warn you 
that if you do anything like this ag ain, I will have no choice but to 
expel you.” 
Snape looked as though Chri stmas had been canceled. He 
cleared his throat and said, “P rofessor Dumbledore, these boys 
have flouted the Decree for the Re striction of Underage Wizardry, 
caused serious damage to an old an d valuable tree — surely acts of 
this nature —” 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 82  “It will be for Professor McGonagall to decide on these boys’ 
punishments, Severus,” said Dumbledore calmly. “They are in her 
House and are therefore her responsi bility.” He turned to Professor 
McGonagall. “I must go back to th e feast, Minerva, I’ ve got to give 
out a few notices. Come , Severus, there’s a delicious-looking cus-
tard tart I want to sample —” 
Snape shot a look of pure venom at Harry and Ron as he allowed 
himself to be swept ou t of his office, leavin g them alone with Pro-
fessor McGonagall, who was still eyei ng them like a wrathful eagle. 
“You’d better get along to the hospital wing, Weasley, you’re 
bleeding.” 
“Not much,” said Ron, hastily wiping the cut over his eye with 
his sleeve. “Professor, I wanted to watch my sister being Sorted —” 
“The Sorting Ceremony is over ,” said Professor McGonagall. 
“Your sister is also in Gryffindor.” 
“Oh, good,” said Ron. “And speaking of Gryffindor —” Professor McGonagall said 
sharply, but Harry cut in: “Professo r, when we took the car, term 
hadn’t started, so — so Gryffind or shouldn’t really have points 
taken from it — should it?” he fi nished, watching her anxiously. 
Professor McGonagall gave him a piercing look, but he was sure 
she had almost smiled. Her mout h looked less thin, anyway. 
“I will not take any points from Gryffindor,” she said, and 
Harry’s heart lightened considerably. “But you will both get a de-tention.” 
It was better than Harry had expected. As for Dumbledore’s 
writing to the Dursleys , that was nothing. Harry knew perfectly 
well they’d just be disappointed th at the Whomping Willow hadn’t 
squashed him flat. 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 83  Professor McGonagall raised her wand again and pointed it at 
Snape’s desk. A large plate of sand wiches, two silver goblets, and a 
jug of iced pumpkin juic e appeared with a pop. 
“You will eat in here and then go straight up to your dormitory,” 
she said. “I must also return to the feast.” 
When the door had closed behind her, Ron let out a long, low 
whistle. 
“I thought we’d had it,” he said, grabbing a sandwich. 
“So did I,” said Harry, taking one, too. 
“Can you believe our luck, though?” said Ron thickly through a 
mouthful of chicken and ham. “Fred and George must’ve flown that car five or six times and no Muggle ever saw them. ” He swal-
lowed and took anot her huge bite. “ Why couldn ’t we get through 
the barrier?” 
Harry shrugged. “We’ll have to watch our step from now on, 
though,” he said, taking a gratef ul swig of pumpkin juice. “Wish 
we could’ve gone up to the feast. . . .” 
“She didn’t want us showing off, ” said Ron sagely. “Doesn’t want 
people to think it’s clever, arriving by flying car.” 
When they had eaten as many sa n d w i c h e s a s t h e y c o u l d ( t h e 
plate kept refilling itself), they ro se and left the office, treading the 
familiar path to Gryffindor Tower. The castle was quiet; it seemed 
that the feast was over. They walked past muttering portraits and creaking suits of armor, and clim bed narrow flights of stone stairs, 
until at last they reached the passage where the secret entrance to 
Gryffindor Tower was hidden, behind an oil painting of a very fat 
woman in a pink silk dress. 
“Password?” she said as they approached. 
“Er —” said Harry. 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 84  They didn’t know the new year’s password, not having met a 
Gryffindor prefect yet, but help came almost immediately; they 
heard hurrying feet behind them and turned to see Hermione 
dashing toward them. 
“There you are! Where have you been? The most ridiculous ru-
mors — someone said you’d been expelled for crashing a flying car —” 
“Well, we haven’t been expelled,” Harry assured her. “You’re not telling me you did fly here?” said Hermione, sound-
ing almost as severe as Professor McGonagall. 
“Skip the lecture,” said Ron impatiently, “and tell us the new 
password.” 
“It’s ‘wattlebird,’ ” said Hermione impatiently, “b ut that’s not 
the point —” 
Her words were cut short, however, as the portrait of the fat lady 
swung open and there was a sudden storm of clapping. It looked 
as though the whole of Gryffindor House was still awake, packed 
into the circular common room, st anding on the lopsided tables 
and squashy armchairs, waiting for them to arrive. Arms reached 
through the portrait hole to pu ll Harry and Ron inside, leaving 
Hermione to scramble in after them. 
“Brilliant!” yelled Lee Jordan. “I nspired! What an entrance! Fly-
ing a car right into the Whomping Willow, people’ll be talking 
about that one for years —” 
“Good for you,” said a fifth ye ar Harry had never spoken to; 
someone was patting him on the ba c k a s t h o u g h h e ’ d j u s t w o n a 
marathon; Fred and George pushed their way to the front of the crowd and said together, “Why couldn’t we’ve come in the car, eh?” 
 
THE WHOMPING WILLOW 
 85  Ron was scarlet in the face, grinning embarrassedly, but Harry 
could see one person who didn’t look happy at all. Percy was visible 
over the heads of some excited first years, and he seemed to be try-
ing to get near enough to start telling them off. Harry nudged Ron 
in the ribs and nodded in Percy’s direction. Ron go t the point at 
once. 
“Got to get upstairs — bit tired, ” he said, and the two of them 
started pushing their wa y toward the door on the other side of the 
room, which led to a spiral staircase and the dormitories. 
“ ’Night,” Harry called back to Hermione, who was wearing a 
scowl just like Percy’s. 
They managed to get to the ot her side of the common room, 
still having their back s slapped, and gained the peace of the stair-
case. They hurried up it, right to the top, and at last reached the 
door of their old dormitory, whic h now had a sign on it saying 
second years . They entered the familiar , circular room, with its 
five four-posters hung with red velvet and its high, narrow win-
dows. Their trunks had been brought up for them and stood at the 
ends of their beds. 
Ron grinned guiltily at Harry. 
“I know I shouldn’t’ve enjoye d that or anything, but —” 
The dormitory door flew open and in came the other second 
year Gryffindor boys, Seamus Finnigan, Dean Thomas, and 
Neville Longbottom. 
“Unbelievable !” beamed Seamus. 
“Cool,” said Dean. “Amazing,” said Ne ville, awestruck. 
Harry couldn’t help it . He grinned, too.

he next day, however, Harry barely grinned once. Things 
started to go downhill from br eakfast in the Great Hall. The 
four long House tables were laden with tureens of porridge, plates 
of kippers, mountains of toast, an d dishes of eggs and bacon, be-
neath the enchanted ceiling (today , a dull, cloudy gray). Harry and 
Ron sat down at the Gryffindor ta ble next to Hermione, who had 
her copy of Voyages with Vampires propped open against a milk jug. 
There was a slight stiffness in th e way she said “ ’ Morning,” which 
told Harry that she was still disa pproving of the way they had ar-
rived. Neville Longbottom, on th e other hand, gree ted them cheer-
fully. Neville was a round-faced and accident-prone boy with the 
worst memory of anyone Harry had ever met. 
“Mail’s due any minute — I think Gran’s sending a few things I 
forgot.” 
Harry had only just started hi s porridge when, sure enough, 
there was a rushing sound overhe ad and a hundred or so owls T 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 87  streamed in, circling the hall an d dropping letters and packages 
into the chattering crowd. A big, lumpy pack age bounced off 
Neville’s head and, a second later, something large and gray fell into 
Hermione’s jug, spraying them all with milk and feathers. 
“Errol !” said Ron, pulling the bedrag gled owl out by the feet. Er-
rol slumped, unconscious, onto the table, his legs in the air and a 
damp red envelope in his beak. 
“Oh, no —” Ron gasped. “It’s all right, he’s still alive,” said Hermione, prodding Errol 
gently with the ti p of her finger. 
“It’s not that — it’s that.” 
Ron was pointing at th e red envelope. It looked quite ordinary 
to Harry, but Ron and Neville were both look ing at it as though 
they expected it to explode. 
“What’s the matter?” said Harry. “She’s — she’s sent me a Howler,” said Ron faintly. “You’d better open it, Ron,” said Neville in a timid whisper. “It’ll 
be worse if you don’t. My gran sent me one once, and I ignored it 
and” — he gulped — “it was horrible.” 
Harry looked from their petrif ied faces to the red envelope. 
“What’s a Howler?” he said. 
But Ron’s whole attention was fixed on the letter, which had be-
gun to smoke at the corners. 
“Open it,” Neville urged. “It’ll al l be over in a few minutes —” 
Ron stretched out a shaking hand , eased the envelope from Er-
rol’s beak, and slit it open. Nevill e stuffed his fingers in his ears. A 
split second later, Ha rry knew why. He thought for a moment it 
had exploded; a roar of sound filled the huge hall, shaking dust 
from the ceiling.

TO THINK WHAT YOUR FATH ER AND I WENT THROUGH 
WHEN WE SAW IT WAS GONE — ” 
Mrs. Weasley’s yells, a hundred times louder than usual, made 
the plates and spoons rattle on the table, and echoed deafeningly 
off the stone walls. People thro ughout the hall were swiveling 
around to see who had received the Howler, and Ron sank so low 
in his chair that only his cr imson forehead could be seen. 
“— LETTER FROM DUMBLEDORE LAST NIGHT, I 
THOUGHT YOUR FATHER WOULD DIE OF SHAME, WE 
DIDN’T BRING YOU UP TO BEHAVE LIKE THIS, YOU AND HARRY COULD BOTH HAVE DIED — ” 
Harry had been wondering when his name was go ing to crop 
up. He tried very hard to look as though he couldn’t hear the voice 
that was making his eardrums throb. 
“— ABSOLUTELY DISGUSTED — YOUR FATHER’S FAC-

AND IF YOU PUT ANOTHER TOE OUT OF LINE WE’LL BRING YOU STRAIGHT BACK HOME. ” 
A ringing silence fe ll. The red envelope , which had dropped 
from Ron’s hand, burst into flames and curled into ashes. Harry 
and Ron sat stunned, as though a tidal wave had just passed over 
them. A few people laug hed and, gradually, a babble of talk broke 
out again. 
Hermione closed Voyages with Vampires and looked down at the 
top of Ron’s head. 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 89  “Well, I don’t know what you expected, Ron, but you —” 
“Don’t tell me I deserved it,” snapped Ron. 
Harry pushed his porridge away. Hi s insides were burning with 
guilt. Mr. Weasley was facing an inquiry at work. After all Mr. and 
Mrs. Weasley had done for him over the summer . . . 
But he had no time to dwell on this; Professor McGonagall was 
moving along the Gryffindor table, handing out course schedules. 
Harry took his and saw that they had double Herbology with the 
Hufflepuffs first. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the castle together, crossed the 
vegetable patch, and made for th e greenhouses, where the magical 
plants were kept. At least the Howler had done one good thing: 
Hermione seemed to think they had now been punished enough 
and was being perfectly friendly again. 
As they neared the greenhouses th ey saw the rest of the class 
standing outside, waiting for Pr ofessor Sprout. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione had only just joined th em when she came striding into 
view across the lawn, accompanie d by Gilderoy Lockhart. Profes-
sor Sprout’s arms were full of band ages, and with another twinge of 
guilt, Harry spotted the Whomping Willow in the distance, several 
of its branches now in slings. 
Professor Sprout was a squat little witch who wore a patched hat 
over her flyaway hair; there was usually a large amount of earth on 
her clothes and her fingernails would have made Aunt Petunia 
faint. Gilderoy Lockhart, however, was immaculate in sweeping 
robes of turquoise, his golden hair shining under a perfectly posi-
tioned turquoise hat with gold trimming. 
“Oh, hello there!” he called, beaming around at the assembled 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 90  students. “Just been showing Profe ssor Sprout the right way to doc-
tor a Whomping Willow! But I don’t want you running away with 
the idea that I’m better at Herbol ogy than she is! I just happen to 
have met several of these exotic plants on my travels . . .” 
“Greenhouse three today, chaps!” said Professor Sprout, who was 
looking distinctly disgruntled, not at all her usual cheerful self. 
There was a murmur of interest. They had only ever worked in 
greenhouse one before — greenhouse three housed far more in-teresting and dangerous plants. Pr ofessor Sprout took a large key 
from her belt and unlocked the door. Harry caught a whiff of damp earth and fertilizer mingling with the heavy perfume of some giant, 
umbrella-sized flowers dangling from the ceiling. He was about to 
follow Ron and Hermione inside when Lockhart’s hand shot out. 
“Harry! I’ve been wanting a word — you don’t mind if he’s a 
couple of minutes late, do you, Professor Sprout?” 
Judging by Professor Sprout’s sc owl, she did mind, but Lockhart 
said, “That’s the ticket ,” and closed the gree nhouse door in her 
face. 
“Harry,” said Lockhart, his larg e white teeth gleaming in the 
sunlight as he shook his he ad. “Harry, Harry, Harry.” 
Completely nonplussed, Harry said nothing. 
“When I heard — well, of course , i t w a s a l l m y f a u l t . C o u l d 
have kicked myself.” 
Harry had no idea what he was talking about. He was about to 
say so when Lockhart went on, “D on’t know when I’ve been more 
shocked. Flying a car to Hogwarts! Well, of course, I knew at once 
why you’d done it. Stood ou t a mile. Harry, Harry, Harry. ” 
It was remarkable how he could sh ow every one of those brilliant 
teeth even when he wasn’t talking. 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 91  “Gave you a taste for publicity, didn’t I?” said Lockhart. “Gave 
you the bug. You got onto the front page of the paper with me and 
you couldn’t wait to do it again.” 
“Oh, no, Professor, see —” 
“Harry, Harry, Harry,” said Lockha rt, reaching out and grasping 
his shoulder. “ I understand . Natural to want a bit more once you’ve 
had that first taste — and I blame myself for giving you that, be-
cause it was bound to go to your head — but see here, young man, 
you can’t start flying cars to try and get yourself noticed. Just calm 
down, all right? Plenty of time for all that when you’re older. Yes, 
yes, I know what you’re thinking! ‘It’s all right for him, he’s an in-
ternationally famous wizard alread y!’ But when I was twelve, I was 
just as much of a nobody as you ar e now. In fact, I’ d say I was even 
more of a nobody! I mean, a few people have heard of you, haven’t 
they? All that business with He -Who-Must-Not-Be-Named!” He 
glanced at the lightning scar on Harry’s forehead. “I know, I 
know — it’s not quite as good as winning Witch Weekly’s Most-
Charming-Smile Award five times in a row, as I have — but it’s a 
start, Harry, it’s a start. ” 
He gave Harry a hearty wink and strode off. Harry stood 
stunned for a few seconds, then, remembering he was supposed to 
be in the greenhouse, he open ed the door and slid inside. 
Professor Sprout was standing be hind a trestle bench in the cen-
ter of the greenhouse. About twenty pairs of different-colored ear-muffs were lying on the bench. When Harry had taken his place 
between Ron and Hermione, she sa id, “We’ll be repotting Man-
drakes today. Now, who can tell me the properties of the Man-
drake?” 
To nobody’s surprise, Hermione’s hand was first into the air. 
CHAPTER SIX 
 92  “Mandrake, or Mandragora, is a powerful restorative,” said Her-
mione, sounding as usual as th ough she had swal lowed the text-
book. “It is used to return people who have been transfigured or 
cursed to their original state.” 
“Excellent. Ten points to Gryffindor,” said Professor Sprout. 
“The Mandrake forms an essential pa rt of most antidotes. It is also, 
however, dangerous. Who can tell me why?” 
Hermione’s hand narrowly missed Harry’s glasses as it shot up 
again. 
“The cry of the Mandrake is fatal to anyone who hears it,” she 
said promptly. 
“Precisely. Take another ten points,” said Professor Sprout. 
“Now, the Mandrakes we have here are still very young.” 
She pointed to a row of deep trays as she spoke, and everyone 
shuffled forward for a better lo ok. A hundred or so tufty little 
plants, purplish green in color, were growing there in rows. They looked quite unremarkable to Har ry, who didn’t ha ve the slightest 
idea what Hermione meant by the “cry” of the Mandrake. 
“Everyone take a pair of earm uffs,” said Professor Sprout. 
There was a scramble as everyone tr ied to seize a pair that wasn’t 
pink and fluffy. 
“When I tell you to put them on, make sure your ears are com-
pletely covered,” said Professor Sprout. “When it is safe to remove 
them, I will give you the th umbs-up. Right — earmuffs on. ” 
Harry snapped the earmuffs over his ears. They shut out sound 
completely. Professor Sprout put the pink, fluffy pair over her own ears, rolled up the sleeves of her robes, grasped one of the tufty plants firmly, and pulled hard. 
 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 93  Harry let out a gasp of surpri se that no one could hear. 
Instead of roots, a small, muddy, and extremely ugly baby 
popped out of the earth. The leav es were growing right out of his 
head. He had pale green, mottled skin, and was clearly bawling at 
the top of his lungs. 
Professor Sprout took a large pl ant pot from under the table and 
plunged the Mandrake into it, burying him in dark, damp com-
post until only the tu fted leaves were visible. Professor Sprout 
dusted off her hands, gave them all the thumbs-up, and removed 
her own earmuffs. 
“As our Mandrakes are only seedlings, their cries won’t kill yet,” 
she said calmly as though she’d just done nothing more exciting 
than water a begoni a. “However, they will knock you out for sev-
eral hours, and as I’m sure none of you want to miss your first day back, make sure your earmuffs are securely in place while you 
work. I will attract your attention when it is time to pack up. 
“Four to a tray — there is a large supply of pots here — com-
post in the sacks over there — and be careful of the Venomous 
Tentacula, it’s teething.” 
She gave a sharp slap to a spiky, dark red plant as she spoke, 
making it draw in the long feele rs that had been inching sneakily 
over her shoulder. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were joined at their tray by a 
curly-haired Hufflepuff boy Harry knew by sight but had never 
spoken to. 
“Justin Finch-Fletchley,” he said brightly, shaking Harry by the 
hand. “Know who you are, of course, the famous Harry Potter. . . . 
And you’re Hermione Granger — always top in everything” 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 94  (Hermione beamed as she had her hand shaken too) “— and 
Ron Weasley. Wasn’t that your flying car?” 
Ron didn’t smile. The Howler wa s obviously still on his mind. 
“That Lockhart’s something, isn’t he ?” said Justin happily as they 
began filling their plant pots with dragon dung compost. “Awfully 
brave chap. Have you read his books? I’d have died of fear if I’d 
been cornered in a telephone booth by a werewolf, but he stayed 
cool and — zap — just fantastic. 
“My name was down for Eton, you know. I can’t tell you how 
glad I am I came here instead. Of course, Mother was slightly dis-
appointed, but since I made her re ad Lockhart’s books I think she’s 
begun to see how useful it’ll be to have a fully trained wizard in the 
family. . . .” 
After that they didn’t have much chance to talk. Their earmuffs 
were back on and they needed to concentrate on the Mandrakes. 
Professor Sprout had made it look extremely ea sy, but it wasn’t. The 
Mandrakes didn’t like coming out of the earth, but didn’t seem to 
want to go back into it either. They squirmed, kicked, flailed their 
sharp little fists, and gnashed their teeth; Harry spent ten whole 
minutes trying to squash a part icularly fat one into a pot. 
By the end of the class, Harry, like everyone else, was sweaty, 
aching, and covered in earth. Everyo ne traipsed back to the castle 
for a quick wash and then the Gry ffindors hurried off to Transfig-
uration. 
Professor McGonagall’s classes we re always hard work, but today 
was especially difficult. Everything Harry had learned last year seemed to have leaked out of his head during the summer. He was 
supposed to be turning a beetle into a button, but all he managed 
 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 95  to do was give his beetle a lot of exer cise as it scuttled over the desk-
top avoiding his wand. 
Ron was having far worse prob lems. He had pa tched up his 
wand with some borrowed Spellotape , but it seemed to be damaged 
beyond repair. It kept crackling and sparking at odd moments, and 
every time Ron tried to transfigur e his beetle it engulfed him in 
thick gray smoke that smelled of rotten eggs. Unable to see what 
he was doing, Ron accidentally squashed his beetle with his el-
bow and had to ask for a new on e. Professor McGonagall wasn’t 
pleased. 
Harry was relieved to hear the lu nch bell. His brain felt like a 
wrung sponge. Everyone filed out of the classroom except him and 
Ron, who was whacking his wand furiously on the desk. 
“Stupid — useless — thing —” “Write home for another one,” Harry suggested as the wand let 
off a volley of bangs like a firecracker. 
“Oh, yeah, and get another Howler back,” said Ron, stuffing the 
now hissing wand into his bag. “ ‘ It’s your own fault your wand got 
snapped —’ ” 
They went down to lunch, wher e Ron’s mood was not improved 
by Hermione’s showing them the ha ndful of perfec t coat buttons 
she had produced in Transfiguration. 
“What’ve we got this afternoon?” said Harry, hastily changing 
the subject. 
“Defense Against the Dark Arts ,” said Hermione at once. 
“Why, ” demanded Ron, seizing her schedule, “have you outlined 
all Lockhart’s lessons in little hearts?” 
Hermione snatched the schedule back, blushing furiously. 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 96  They finished lunch and went outside into the overcast court-
yard. Hermione sat down on a stone step and buried her nose in 
Voyages with Vampires again. Harry and Ro n stood talking about 
Quidditch for several minutes befo re Harry became aware that he 
was being closely watched. Look ing up, he saw the very small, 
mousy-haired boy he’d seen trying on the Sorting Hat last night 
staring at Harry as though transfixed. He was clutching what 
looked like an ordinary Muggle camera, and the moment Harry 
looked at him, he went bright red. 
“All right, Harry? I’m — I’m Colin Creevey,” he said breath-
lessly, taking a tentative step fo rward. “I’m in Gryffindor, too. 
D’you think — would it be all right if — can I have a picture?” he 
said, raising the camera hopefully. 
“A picture?” Harry repeated blankly. “So I can prove I’ve met you,” sa id Colin Creevey eagerly, edg-
ing further forward. “I know all about you. Everyone’s told me. 
About how you survived when Yo u-Know-Who tried to kill you 
and how he disappeared and everyt hing and how you’ve still got a 
lightning scar on your forehead” (his eyes raked Harry’s hairline) 
“and a boy in my dormitory said if I develop the film in the right 
potion, the pictures’ll move.” Colin drew a great shuddering breath 
of excitement and said, “It’s amazing here, isn’t it? I never knew all 
the odd stuff I could do was magic till I got the letter from Hog-
warts. My dad’s a milkman, he coul dn’t believe it either. So I’m tak-
ing loads of pictures to send home to him. And it’d be really good 
if I had one of you” — he look ed imploringly at Harry — “maybe 
your friend could take it and I co uld stand next to you? And then, 
could you sign it?” 
 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 97  “Signed photos ? You’re giving out signed photos, Potter?” 
Loud and scathing, Draco Malfoy’s voice echoed around the 
courtyard. He had stopped right be hind Colin, flanked, as he al-
ways was at Hogwarts, by his large and thuggi sh cronies, Crabbe 
and Goyle. 
“Everyone line up!” Malfoy roared to the crowd. “Harry Potter’s 
giving out signed photos!” 
“No, I’m not,” said Harry angrily, his fists clenching. “Shut up, 
Malfoy.” 
“You’re just jealous,” piped up Colin, whose entire body was 
about as thick as Crabbe’s neck. 
“Jealous ?” said Malfoy, who didn’t need to shout anymore: Half 
the courtyard was listening in. “Of what? I don’t want a foul scar 
right across my head, thanks. I do n’t think getting your head cut 
open makes you that special, myself.” 
Crabbe and Goyle were sniggering stupidly. 
“Eat slugs, Malfoy,” said Ron an grily. Crabbe st opped laughing 
and started rubbing his knuckles in a menacing way. 
“Be careful, Weasley,” sneered Ma lfoy. “You don’t want to start 
any trouble or your mommy’ll have to come and take you away 
from school.” He put on a shrill, piercing voice. “ If you put another 
toe out of line —” 
A knot of Slytherin fifth years nearby laughed lo udly at this. 
“Weasley would like a signed photo, Potter,” smirked Malfoy. 
“It’d be worth more than his family’s whole house —” 
Ron whipped out his Spellotaped wand, but Hermione shut 
Voyages with Vampires with a snap and whispered, “Look out!” 
“What’s all this, what’s all this?” Gilderoy Lockhart was striding 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 98  toward them, his turquoise robes swirling behind him. “Who’s giv-
ing out signed photos?” 
Harry started to speak but he was cut short as Lock hart flung an 
arm around his shoulders and thun dered jovially, “Shouldn’t have 
asked! We meet again, Harry!” 
Pinned to Lockhart’s side and burning with humiliation, Harry 
saw Malfoy slide smirking back into the crowd. 
“Come on then, Mr. Creevey,” said Lockhart, beaming at Colin. 
“A double portrait, can’t do better than that, and we’ll both sign it 
for you.” 
Colin fumbled for his camera an d took the picture as the bell 
rang behind them, signaling the start of afternoon classes. 
“Off you go, move along there,” Lockhart called to the crowd, 
and he set off back to the castle with Harry, who was wishing he 
knew a good Vanishing Spell, still clasped to his side. 
“A word to the wise, Harry,” said Lockhart paternally as they 
entered the building through a side door. “I covered up for you back there with young Creevey — if he was photographing me, 
too, your schoolmates won’t think you’re setting yourself up so 
much. . . .” 
Deaf to Harry’s stammers, Lockhart swept him down a corridor 
lined with staring students and up a staircase. 
“Let me just say that handing out signed pictures at this stage of 
your career isn’t sensible — look s a tad bigheaded, Harry, to be 
frank. There may well come a time when, like me, you’ll need to 
keep a stack handy wherever you go, but” — he gave a little chor-
tle — “I don’t think yo u’re quite there yet.” 
They had reached Lockhart’s classroom and he let Harry go at 
 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 99  last. Harry yanked his robes straight and headed for a seat at the 
very back of the class, where he bu sied himself with piling all seven 
of Lockhart’s books in front of hi m, so that he could avoid looking 
at the real thing. 
The rest of the class came clat tering in, and Ron and Hermione 
sat down on either side of Harry. 
“You could’ve fried an egg on your face,” said Ron. “You’d better 
hope Creevey doesn’t meet Ginny, or they’ll be starting a Harry 
Potter fan club.” 
“Shut up,” snapped Harry. The la st thing he needed was for 
Lockhart to hear the phrase “Harry Potter fan club.” 
When the whole class was seated, Lockhart cleared his throat 
loudly and silence fell. He reac hed forward, picked up Neville 
Longbottom’s copy of Travels with Trolls, and held it up to show his 
own, winking portrait on the front. 
“Me,” he said, pointing at it and winking as well. “Gilderoy 
Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third Class, Honorary Member of the 
Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s 
Most-Charming-Smile Award — bu t I don’t talk about that. I 
didn’t get rid of th e Bandon Banshee by smiling at her!” 
He waited for them to laugh; a few people smiled weakly. 
“I see you’ve all bought a co mplete set of my books — well 
done. I thought we’d start today with a little qu iz. Nothing to 
worry about — just to check how well you’ ve read them, how 
much you’ve taken in —” 
When he had handed out the test pa pers he returned to the front 
of the class and said, “You ha ve thirty minutes — start — now!” 
Harry looked down at his paper and read: 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 100  1. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s favorite color ? 
 2. What is Gilderoy Lockhart’s secret ambition ? 
 3. What, in your opinio n, is Gilderoy Lockhart’s 
greatest achievement to date ? 
 
On and on it went, over three sides of paper, right down to: 
 
54. When is Gilderoy Lock hart’s birthday, and what 
would his ideal gift be ? 
 
Half an hour later, Lockhart collected the papers and rifled 
through them in front of the class. 
“Tut, tut — hardly any of you remembered that my favorite 
color is lilac. I say so in Year with the Yeti. And a few of you need to 
read Wanderings with Werewolves more carefully — I clearly state in 
chapter twelve that my ideal birthday gift would be harmony be-tween all magic and non-magic peoples — though I wouldn’t say no 
to a large bottle of Og den’s Old Firewhisky!” 
He gave them another roguish wink. Ron was now staring at 
Lockhart with an expression of di sbelief on his face; Seamus Finni-
gan and Dean Thomas, w h o w e r e s i t t i n g i n f r o n t , w e r e s h a k i n g 
with silent laughter. Hermione, on the other hand, was listening to 
Lockhart with rapt attention an d gave a start when he mentioned 
her name. 
“. . . but Miss Hermione Granger k new my secret ambition is to 
rid the world of evil and market my own range of hair-care po-
tions — good girl! In fact” — he flipped her paper over — “full 
marks! Where is Miss Hermione Granger?” 
 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 101  Hermione raised a trembling hand. 
“Excellent!” beamed Lockhart. “Quite excellent! Take ten points 
for Gryffindor! And so — to business —” 
He bent down behind his desk an d lifted a large, covered cage 
onto it. 
“Now — be warned! It is my jo b to arm you against the foulest 
creatures known to wizardkind! You may find yourselves facing 
your worst fears in this room. Know only that no harm can befall 
you whilst I am here. All I as k is that you remain calm.” 
In spite of himself, Harry leaned around his pile of books for a 
better look at the cage . Lockhart placed a hand on the cover. Dean 
and Seamus had stopped laughing no w. Neville was cowering in his 
front row seat. 
“I must ask you not to scream,” said Lockhart in a low voice. “It 
might provoke them.” 
As the whole class held its br eath, Lockhart whipped off the 
cover. 
“Yes,” he said dramatically. “ Freshly caught Cornish pixies. ” 
Seamus Finnigan couldn’t control himself. He let out a snort of 
laughter that even Lockhart couldn ’t mistake for a scream of terror. 
“Yes?” He smil ed at Seamus. 
“Well, they’re not — they’re not very — dangerous, are they?” 
Seamus choked. 
“Don’t be so sure!” said Lockha rt, waggling a finger annoyingly 
at Seamus. “Devilish tricky li ttle blighters they can be!” 
The pixies were electric blue and about eight inches high, with 
pointed faces and voices so shrill it was like listening to a lot of 
budgies arguing. The moment the cover had been removed, they 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 102  had started jabbering and rocketin g around, rattling the bars and 
making bizarre faces at the people nearest them. 
“Right, then,” Lockhart said loudly. “Let’s see what you make of 
them!” And he opened the cage. 
It was pandemonium. The pixies shot in every direction like 
rockets. Two of them seized Neville by the ears and lifted him into 
the air. Several shot straight through the window, showering the 
back row with broken glass. The re st proceeded to wreck the class-
room more effectively than a rampaging rhino. They grabbed ink bottles and sprayed the class wi th them, shredded books and pa-
pers, tore pictures from the wa lls, up-ended the waste basket, 
grabbed bags and books and thre w them out of the smashed win-
dow; within minutes, half the class was sheltering under desks and 
Neville was swinging from the ir on chandelier in the ceiling. 
“Come on now — round them up, round them up, they’re only 
pixies,” Lockhart shouted. 
He rolled up his sleeves, brandished his wand, and bellowed, 
“Peskipiksi Pesternomi !” 
It had absolutely no effect; one of the pixies seized his wand and 
threw it out of the window, too. Lockhart gulped and dived under 
his own desk, narrowly avoiding being squashed by Neville, who fell a second later as th e chandelier gave way. 
The bell rang and there was a mad rush toward the exit. In the 
relative calm that followed, Lock hart straightened up, caught sight 
of Harry, Ron, and Hermione, wh o were almost at the door, and 
said, “Well, I’ll ask you three to just nip the rest of them back into 
their cage.” He swept past them and shut the door quickly behind 
him. 
 
GILDEROY LOCKHART 
 103  “Can you believe him?” roared Ron as on e of the remaining pix-
ies bit him painfully on the ear. 
“He just wants to give us so me hands-on experience,” said 
Hermione, immobilizing two pixies at once with a clever Freezing 
Charm and stuffing them back into their cage. 
“Hands on ?” said Harry, who was tryi ng to grab a pixie dancing 
out of reach with its tongue out. “Hermione, he didn’t have a clue 
what he was doing —” 
“Rubbish,” said Hermione. “You’v e read his books — look at all 
those amazing thin gs he’s done —” 
“He says he’s done,” Ron muttered.

 104  MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 
 
arry spent a lot of time over the next few days dodging 
out of sight whenever he sa w Gilderoy Lockhart coming 
down a corridor. Harder to avoi d was Colin Creevey, who seemed 
to have memorized Harry’s sche dule. Nothing seemed to give 
Colin a bigger thrill than to say, “All right, Harry?” six or seven 
times a day and hear, “Hello, Co lin,” back, however exasperated 
Harry sounded when he said it. 
Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car 
journey and Ron’s wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself 
on Friday morning by shooting ou t of Ron’s hand in Charms and 
hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creat-
ing a large, throbbing green boil wh ere it had struck. So with one 
thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, 
Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday 
morning. Harry, however, was shak en awake several hours earlier 
 H 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 105  than he would have liked by Ol iver Wood, Captain of the Gryf-
findor Quidditch team. 
“Whassamatter?” said Harry groggily. 
“Quidditch practice!” said Wood. “Come on!” 
Harry squinted at the window. Th ere was a thin mist hanging 
across the pink-and-gold sky. Now that he was awake, he couldn’t 
understand how he could have slept through the racket the birds 
were making. 
“Oliver,” Harry croaked. “I t’s the crack of dawn.” 
“Exactly,” said Wood. He was a ta ll and burly sixth year and, at 
the moment, his eyes were gleaming with a crazed enthusiasm. “It’s 
part of our new training program. Come on, grab your broom, and 
let’s go,” said Wood heartily. “None of the other teams have started 
training yet; we’re going to be first off the mark this year —” 
Yawning and shivering slightly, Harry climbed out of bed and 
tried to find his Quidditch robes. 
“Good man,” said Wood. “Meet you on the field in fifteen min-
utes.” 
When he’d found his scarlet team robes and pulled on his cloak 
for warmth, Harry scribbled a no te to Ron explaining where 
he’d gone and went down the spiral staircase to the common 
room, his Nimbus Two Thousand on his shoulder. He had just 
reached the portrait hole when there was a clatter behind him and Colin Creevey came dashing down th e spiral staircase, his camera 
swinging madly around his neck and something clutched in his 
hand. 
“I heard someone saying your name on the stairs, Harry! Look 
what I’ve got here! I’ve had it de veloped, I wanted to show you —” 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 106  Harry looked bemusedly at the ph otograph Colin was brandish-
ing under his nose. 
A moving, black-and-white Lockha rt was tugging hard on an 
arm Harry recognized as his own. He was pleased to see that his 
photographic self was putting up a good fight and refusing to be 
d r a g g e d i n t o v i e w . A s H a r r y w a t c h e d , L o c k h a r t g a v e u p a n d 
slumped, panting, against the white edge of the picture. 
“Will you sign it?” said Colin eagerly. “No,” said Harry flatly, glancing around to check that the room 
was really deserted. “Sorry, Co lin, I’m in a hurry — Quidditch 
practice —” 
He climbed through the portrait hole. 
“Oh, wow! Wait for me! I’ve never watched a Quidditch game 
before!” 
Colin scrambled through the hole after him. 
“It’ll be really boring,” Harry said quickly, but Colin ignored 
him, his face shinin g with excitement. 
“You were the youngest House play er in a hundred years, weren’t 
you, Harry? Weren’t you?” said Coli n, trotting alongside him. “You 
must be brilliant. I’ve never flow n . I s i t e a s y ? I s t h a t y o u r o w n 
broom? Is that the best one there is?” 
Harry didn’t know how to get rid of him. It was like having an 
extremely talkative shadow. 
“I don’t really understand Quid ditch,” said Coli n breathlessly. 
“Is it true there are four balls? And two of them fl y around trying 
to knock people off their brooms?” 
“Yes,” said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated 
rules of Quidditch. “They’re called Bludgers. There are two Beaters 
 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 107  on each team who carry clubs to be at the Bludgers away from their 
side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters.” 
“And what are the other balls for?” Colin asked, tripping down a 
couple of steps because he was gazing open-mouthed at Harry. 
“Well, the Quaffle — that’s th e biggish red one — is the one 
that scores goals. Three Chasers on each team throw the Quaffle to 
each other and try and get it thro ugh the goal posts at the end of 
the pitch — they’re three long poles with hoops on the end.” 
“And the fourth ball —” 
“— is the Golden Snitch,” said Ha rry, “and it’s very small, very 
fast, and difficult to catch. But that’s what the Seeker’s got to do, 
because a game of Quidditch doesn’t end until the Snitch has been 
caught. And whichever team’s Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points.” 
“And you’re the Gryffindor Seeker, aren’t you?” said Colin in awe. 
“Yes,” said Harry as they left the castle and started across the 
dew-drenched grass. “And there’s the Keeper, too. He guards the 
goal posts. That’s it, really.” 
But Colin didn’t stop questi oning Harry all the way down the 
sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him 
off when he reached th e changing rooms; Coli n called after him in 
a piping voice, “I’ll go and get a good seat, Harry!” and hurried off 
to the stands. 
The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the chang-
ing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. 
Fred and George Weasley were si tting, puffy-eyed and tousle-
haired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nod-
ding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 108  Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite 
them. 
“There you are, Harry, what kept you?” said Wood briskly. 
“Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new 
training program, which I really think will make all the differ-ence. . . .” 
Wood was holding up a large diag ram of a Quidditch field, on 
which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in different-
colored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the 
arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood 
launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley’s head 
drooped right onto Al icia Spinnet’s shoulder and he began to 
snore. 
The first board took nearly twent y minutes to explain, but there 
was another board under that, an d a third under that one. Harry 
sank into a stupor as Wood droned on and on. 
“So,” said Wood, at long last, jerking Harry from a wistful fan-
tasy about what he could be eating for breakfast at this very mo-
ment up at the castle. “Is that clear? Any questions?” 
“I’ve got a question, Oliver,” sa id George, who had woken with 
a start. “Why couldn’t you have to ld us all this yesterday when we 
were awake?” 
Wood wasn’t pleased. 
“Now, listen here, you lot,” he said, glowering at them all. “We 
should have won the Quidditch Cup last year. We’re easily the best 
team. But unfortunately — owing to circumstances beyond our 
control —” 
 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 109  Harry shifted guiltily in his se at. He had been unconscious in 
the hospital wing for the final ma tch of the previous year, meaning 
that Gryffindor had be en a player short and had suffered their 
worst defeat in three hundred years. 
Wood took a moment to regain co ntrol of himself. Their last de-
feat was clearly st ill torturing him. 
“So this year, we train harder than ever before. . . . Okay, let’s go 
and put our new theories into prac tice!” Wood shouted, seizing his 
broomstick and leading the way ou t of the locker rooms. Stiff-
legged and still yawning, his team followed. 
They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up 
completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in 
the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Her-
mione sitting in the stands. 
“Aren’t you finished yet?” called Ron incredulously. 
“Haven’t even started,” said Harry , looking jealously at the toast 
and marmalade Ron and Hermione had brought out of the Great Hall. “Wood’s been te aching us new moves.” 
He mounted his broomstick and kicked at the ground, soaring 
up into the air. The cool mornin g air whipped his face, waking him 
far more effectively than Wood’s lo ng talk. It felt wonderful to be 
back on the Quidditch field. He soared right around the stadium at full speed, raci ng Fred and George. 
“What’s that funny clicking noise? ” called Fred as they hurtled 
around the corner. 
Harry looked into the stands. Co lin was sitting in one of the 
highest seats, his camera raised, taking picture after picture, the 
sound strangely magnified in the deserted stadium. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 110  “Look this way, Harry! Th is way!” he cried shrilly. 
“Who’s that?” said Fred. 
“No idea,” Harry lied, putting on a spurt of speed that took him 
as far away as possible from Colin. 
“What’s going on?” said Wood, frowning, as he skimmed 
through the air toward them. “Why’s that first year taking pictures? I don’t like it. He could be a Slythe rin spy, trying to find out about 
our new training program.” 
“He’s in Gryffindor,” said Harry quickly. 
“And the Slytherins don’t need a spy, Oliver,” said George. 
“What makes you say that ?” said Wood testily. 
“Because they’re here in pers on,” said George, pointing. 
Several people in green robes were walking onto the field, 
broomsticks in their hands. 
“I don’t believe it!” Wood hissed in outrage. “I booked the field 
for today! We’ll see about this!” 
Wood shot toward the ground, la nding rather harder than he 
meant to in his an ger, staggering slightly as he dismounted. Harry, 
Fred, and George followed. 
“Flint!” Wood bellowed at the Sl ytherin Captain. “This is our 
practice time! We got up spec ially! You can clear off now!” 
Marcus Flint was even larger than Wood. He had a look of troll-
ish cunning on his face as he replied, “Plenty of room for all of us, Wood.” 
Angelina, Alicia, and Katie had come over, too. There were no 
girls on the Slytherin team, who st ood shoulder to shoulder, facing 
the Gryffindors, leering to a man. 
“But I booked the fiel d!” said Wood, positi vely spitting with 
rage. “I booked it!” 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 111  “Ah,” said Flint. “But I’ve got a specially signed note here from 
Professor Snape. ‘ I, Professor S. Snape, give the Slytherin team per-
mission to practice today on the Quidditch field owing to the need to 
train their new Seeker. ’” 
“You’ve got a new Seek er?” said Wood, di stracted. “Where?” 
And from behind the six large fi gures before them came a sev-
enth, smaller boy, smirking all over his pale, pointed face. It was 
Draco Malfoy. 
“Aren’t you Lucius Malfoy’s son?” said Fred, look ing at Malfoy 
with dislike. 
“Funny you should mention Draco’s father,” said Flint as the 
whole Slytherin team smiled still more broadly. “Let me show you 
the generous gift he’s made to the Slytherin team.” 
All seven of them held out their broomsticks. Seven highly pol-
ished, brand-new handles and sev en sets of fine gold lettering 
spelling the words Nimbus Two Thousand and One gleamed under 
the Gryffindors’ noses in the early morning sun. 
“Very latest model. Only came out last month,” said Flint 
carelessly, flicking a sp eck of dust from the end of his own. “I be-
lieve it outstrips the old Two Thou sand series by a considerable 
amount. As for the old Cleansweeps” — he smiled nastily at Fred 
and George, who were both clutch ing Cleansweep Fives — “sweeps 
the board with them.” 
None of the Gryffindor team could think of anything to say for 
a moment. Malfoy was smirking so broadly his cold eyes were re-
duced to slits. 
“Oh, look,” said Flint. “A field invasion.” Ron and Hermione were crossing the grass to se e what was go-
ing on. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 112  “What’s happening?” Ron asked Ha rry. “Why aren’t you play-
ing? And what’s he doing here?” 
He was looking at Malfoy, taki ng in his Slytherin Quidditch 
robes. 
“I’m the new Slytherin Seeker, Weasley,” said Malfoy, smugly. 
“Everyone’s just been admiring the brooms my father’s bought our 
team.” 
Ron gaped, openmouthed, at the seven superb broomsticks in 
front of him. 
“Good, aren’t they?” said Malf oy smoothly. “But perhaps the 
Gryffindor team will be able to raise some gold and get new 
brooms, too. You could raffle off those Cleans weep Fives; I expect 
a museum would bid for them.” 
The Slytherin team howled with laughter. 
“At least no one on the Gryffindor team had to buy their way 
in,” said Hermione sharply. “ They got in on pure talent.” 
The smug look on Malf oy’s face flickered. 
“No one asked your opinion, you filthy little Mudblood,” he 
spat. 
Harry knew at once that Malfoy had said something really bad 
because there was an instant uproar at his words. Flint had to dive 
in front of Malfoy to stop Fred and George jumping on him, Ali-cia shrieked, “ How dare you !”, and Ron plunged his hand into his 
robes, pulled out his wand, yellin g, “You’ll pay for that one, Mal-
foy!” and pointed it fu riously under Flint’s ar m at Malfoy’s face. 
A loud bang echoed around the stadium and a jet of green light 
shot out of the wrong end of Ron’ s wand, hitting him in the stom-
ach and sending him reeling backward onto the grass. 
 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 113  “Ron! Ron! Are you all ri ght?” squealed Hermione. 
Ron opened his mouth to speak, but no words came out. Instead 
he gave an almighty belch and se veral slugs dribbled out of his 
mouth onto his lap. 
The Slytherin team were paralyzed with laughter. Flint was dou-
bled up, hanging onto his new br oomstick for support. Malfoy was 
on all fours, banging the ground wi th his fist. The Gryffindors were 
gathered around Ron, who kept be lching large, glis tening slugs. 
Nobody seemed to want to touch him. 
“We’d better get him to Hagrid’s , it’s nearest,” said Harry to 
Hermione, who nodded bravely, and the pair of them pulled Ron 
up by the arms. 
“What happened, Harry? What happ ened? Is he ill? But you can 
cure him, can’t you?” Colin had run down from his seat and was 
now dancing alongside them as they left the field. Ron gave a huge 
heave and more slugs dribbled down his front. 
“Oooh,” said Colin, fascinated and raising his camera. “Can you 
hold him still, Harry?” 
“Get out of the way, Colin!” said Harry angrily. He and Her-
mione supported Ron out of the stadium and across the grounds 
toward the edge of the forest. 
“Nearly there, Ron,” said Herm ione as the gamekeeper’s cabin 
came into view. “You’ll be all right in a minu te — almost there —” 
They were within twenty feet of Hagrid’s house when the front 
door opened, but it wa sn’t Hagrid who emer ged. Gilderoy Lock-
hart, wearing robes of palest ma uve today, came striding out. 
“Quick, behind here,” Harry hissed, dragging Ron behind a 
nearby bush. Hermione follow ed, somewhat reluctantly. 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 114  “It’s a simple matter if you know what you’re doing!” Lockhart 
was saying loudly to Hagrid. “If you need help, you know where I 
am! I’ll let you have a copy of my book. I’m surprised you haven’t already got one — I’ll sign one tonight and send it over. Well, 
good-bye!” And he strode away toward the castle. 
Harry waited until Lockhart was ou t of sight, then pulled Ron 
out of the bush and up to Hagrid’s front door. They knocked ur-
gently. 
Hagrid appeared at once, looking very gr umpy, but his expres-
sion brightened when he saw who it was. 
“Bin wonderin’ when you’d come ter see me — come in, come 
in — thought you mighta bin Professor Lockhart back again —” 
Harry and Hermione supported Ron over the threshold into the 
one-roomed cabin, which had an enormous bed in one corner, a fire crackling merrily in the other. Hagrid didn’t seem perturbed by 
Ron’s slug problem, which Harry hastily explained as he lowered 
Ron into a chair. 
“Better out than in,” he said ch eerfully, plunking a large copper 
basin in front of him. “Get ’em all up, Ron.” 
“I don’t think there’s anything to do except wait for it to stop,” 
said Hermione anxiously, watching Ron bend over the basin. 
“That’s a difficult curse to work at the best of times, but with a bro-
ken wand —” 
Hagrid was bustling around maki ng them tea. His boarhound, 
Fang, was slobbering over Harry. 
“What did Lockhart want with you, Hagrid?” Harry asked, 
scratching Fa ng’s ears. 
“Givin’ me advice on gettin’ kelpies out of a well,” growled 
 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 115  Hagrid, moving a half-plucked ro oster off his scrubbed table and 
setting down the teapot. “Like I don’ know. An’ bangin’ on about 
some banshee he banished. If one wo rd of it was true, I’ll eat my 
kettle.” 
It was most unlike Hagrid to cr iticize a Hogwarts teacher, and 
Harry looked at him in surprise. Hermione, however, said in a 
voice somewhat higher than usual, “I think you’re being a bit un-
fair. Professor Dumbledore obviousl y thought he was the best man 
for the job —” 
“He was the on’y man for the job,” said Hagrid, offering them a 
plate of treacle toffee, while Ron coughed squelchily into his basin. 
“An’ I mean the on’y one. Gettin’ very difficult ter find anyone fer 
the Dark Arts job. People aren’t to o keen ter take it on, see. They’re 
startin’ ter think it’s jinxed. No o ne’s lasted long fer a while now. So 
tell me,” said Hagrid, jerking his head at Ron. “Who was he tryin’ ter curse?” 
“Malfoy called Hermione somethin g — it must’ve been really 
bad, because everyone went wild.” 
“It was bad,” said Ron hoarsely, emerging over the tabletop look-
ing pale and sweaty. “Malfoy called her ‘Mudblood,’ Hagrid —” 
Ron dived out of sight again as a fresh wave of slugs made their 
appearance. Hagrid looked outraged. 
“He didn’!” he growled at Hermione. “He did,” she said. “But I don’t know what it means. I could tell 
it was really rude, of course —” 
“It’s about the most insulting th ing he could think of,” gasped 
Ron, coming back up. “Mudblood’s a really foul name for someone 
who is Muggle-born — you know, non-magic parents. There are 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 116  some wizards — like Malfoy’s fa mily — who think they’re better 
than everyone else because they’r e what people call pure-blood.” 
He gave a small burp, and a single slug fell into his outstretched 
hand. He threw it into the basin and continue d, “I mean, the rest 
of us know it doesn’t make any difference at all. Look at Neville 
Longbottom — he’s pure-blood an d he can hardly stand a caul-
dron the right way up.” 
“An’ they haven’t invented a spell our Hermione can’ do,” said 
Hagrid proudly, making Hermione go a brilliant shade of magenta. 
“It’s a disgusting thing to call someone,” said Ron, wiping his 
sweaty brow with a shaking hand. “Dirty blood, see. Common blood. It’s ridiculous. Most wiza rds these days are half-blood any-
way. If we hadn’t married Muggles we’d’ve died out.” 
He retched and ducked out of sight again. 
“Well, I don’ blame yeh fer tryin’ ter curse him, Ron,” said Ha-
grid loudly over the thuds of mo re slugs hitting the basin. “Bu’ 
maybe it was a g ood thing yer wand backfire d. ’Spect Lucius Mal-
foy would’ve come marchin’ up ter school if yeh’d cursed his son. 
Least yer not in trouble.” 
Harry would have pointed out that trouble didn’t come much 
worse than having slugs pourin g out of your mouth, but he 
couldn’t; Hagrid’s treacle toffee had cemented his jaws together. 
“Harry,” said Hagrid abruptly as though struck by a sudden 
thought. “Gotta bone ter pick with yeh. I’ve heard you’ve bin givin’ out signed photos. How come I haven’t got one?” 
Furious, Harry wrench ed his teeth apart. 
“I have not been giving out signed photos,” he said hotly. “If 
Lockhart’s still spreading that around —” 
 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 117  But then he saw that Hagrid was laughing. 
“I’m on’y jokin’,” he said, patt ing Harry genially on the back and 
sending him face first into the tabl e. “I knew yeh hadn’t really. I 
told Lockhart yeh didn’ need teh. Yer more famous than him with-
out tryin’.” 
“Bet he didn’t like that,” said Harry, sitting up and rubbing his 
chin. 
“Don’ think he did,” said Hagrid, his eyes twinkling. “An’ then 
I told him I’d never re ad one o’ his books an ’ he decided ter go. 
Treacle toffee, Ron?” he added as Ron reappeared. 
“No thanks,” said Ron weakly. “Better not risk it.” 
“Come an’ see what I’ve bin growin’,” said Hagrid as Harry and 
Hermione finished the last of their tea. 
In the small vegetable patch behi nd Hagrid’s house were a dozen 
of the largest pumpkins Harry had ever seen. Each was the size of a large boulder. 
“Gettin’ on well, aren’t they?” said Hagrid happily. “Fer the Hal-
loween feast . . . should be big enough by then.” 
“What’ve you been feeding them?” said Harry. 
Hagrid looked over his shoulder to check that they were alone. 
“Well, I’ve bin givin’ them — you know — a bit o’ help —” 
Harry noticed Hagrid’s flowery pink umbrella leaning against 
the back wall of the cabin. Harry had had reason to believe before 
now that this umbrella was not al l it looked; in fact, he had the 
strong impression that Hagrid’s old school wand was concealed in-
side it. Hagrid wasn’t supposed to use magic. He had been expelled 
from Hogwarts in his third year, but Harry had never found out why — any mention of the matter and Hagrid would clear his

changed. 
“An Engorgement Charm, I suppose?” said Hermione, halfway 
between disapproval and amusement. “Well, you’ve done a good 
job on them.” 
“That’s what yer little sister said,” said Ha grid, nodding at Ron. 
“Met her jus’ yesterday.” Hagrid looked sideways at Harry, his 
beard twitching. “Said she was jus’ lookin’ round the grounds, but 
I reckon she was hopin’ she migh t run inter someo ne else at my 
house.” He winked at Harry. “If yeh ask me, she wouldn’ say no ter 
a signed —” 
“Oh, shut up,” said Harry. Ron snorted with laughter and the 
ground was sprayed with slugs. 
“Watch it!” Hagrid roared, pull ing Ron away from his precious 
pumpkins. 
It was nearly lunchtime and as Harry had only had one bit of 
treacle toffee since dawn, he was k een to go back to school to eat. 
They said good-bye to Hagrid and walked back up to the castle, 
Ron hiccoughing occasionally, but on ly bringing up two very small 
slugs. 
They had barely set foot in th e cool entrance hall when a voice 
rang out, “There you are, Potter — Weasley.” Professor McGona-
gall was walking toward them, lo oking stern. “You will both do 
your detentions this evening.” 
“What’re we doing, Professor?” said Ron, nervously suppressing 
a burp. 
“You will be polishing the silver in the trophy room with Mr. 
Filch,” said Professor McGonagall . “And no magic, Weasley — el-
bow grease.” 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 119  Ron gulped. Argus Filch, the care taker, was loathed by every stu-
dent in the school. 
“And you, Potter, will be helpin g Professor Lockhart answer his 
fan mail,” said Pr ofessor McGonagall. 
“Oh n — Professor, can’t I go and do the trophy room, too?” 
said Harry desperately. 
“Certainly not,” said Professor McGonagall, raising her eyebrows. 
“Professor Lockhart requested you particularly. Eight o’clock 
sharp, both of you.” 
Harry and Ron slouched into the Gr eat Hall in states of deepest 
gloom, Hermione behind them, wearing a well-you-did-break-
school-rules sort of expression. Harry di dn’t enjoy his shepherd’s pie 
as much as he’d thought. Both he and Ron felt they’d got the worse deal. 
“Filch’ll have me there all night,” said Ron heavily. “No magic! 
There must be about a hundred cups in that room. I’m no good at Muggle cleaning.” 
“I’d swap anytime,” said Harry ho llowly. “I’ve had loads of prac-
tice with the Dursleys. Answering Lo ckhart’s fan mail . . . he’ll be a 
nightmare. . . .” 
Saturday afternoon seemed to melt away, and in what seemed 
like no time, it was five minute s to eight, and Harry was dragging 
his feet along the second-floor co rridor to Lockhart’s office. He 
gritted his teeth and knocked. 
The door flew open at once. Lo ckhart beamed down at him. 
“Ah, here’s the scalawag!” he said. “Come in, Harry, come in —” Shining brightly on the walls by the light of many candles were 
countless framed photographs of Lockhart. He had even signed a 
few of them. Another larg e pile lay on his desk. 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 120  “You can address the envelopes!” Lockhart told Ha rry, as though 
this was a huge treat. “This firs t one’s to Gladys Gudgeon, bless 
her — huge fan of mine —” 
The minutes snailed by. Harry let Lockhart’s voice wash over 
him, occasionally saying, “Mmm” and “Right” and “Yeah.” Now 
and then he caught a phrase like, “Fame’s a fickle friend, Harry,” or 
“Celebrity is as celebrit y does, remember that.” 
The candles burned lower and lo wer, making the light dance 
over the many moving faces of Lockhart watching him. Harry 
moved his aching hand over what felt like the thousandth enve-
lope, writing out Veronica Smethley’s address. It must be nearly time to leave, Harry thought miserably, please let it be nearly time. . . . 
And then he heard something — something quite apart from 
the spitting of the dying candles and Lockhart’s prattle about his 
fans. 
It was a voice, a voice to chill the bone marrow, a voice of breath-
taking, ice-cold venom. 
“Come . . . come to me. . . . Let me rip you. . . . Let me tear 
you. . . . Let me kill you. . . .” 
Harry gave a huge jump and a large lilac blot appeared on 
Veronica Smethley’s street. 
“What ?” he said loudly. 
“ I k n o w ! ” s a i d L o c k h a r t . “ S i x s o l i d m o n t h s a t t h e t o p o f t h e 
best-seller list! Br oke all records!” 
“No,” said Harry franti cally. “That voice!” 
“Sorry?” said Lockhart, look ing puzzled. “What voice?” 
“That — that voice that said — didn’t you hear it?” Lockhart was looking at Harry in high astonishment. 
 
MUDBLOODS AND MURMURS 
 121  “What are you talking about, Harry? Perhaps you’re getting a lit-
tle drowsy? Great Scott — look at the time! “We’ve been here nearly 
four hours! I’d never have believed it — the time ’s flown, hasn’t it?” 
Harry didn’t answer. He was strain ing his ears to hear the voice 
again, but there was no sound now except for Lockhart telling him 
he mustn’t expect a treat like this every time he got detention. Feel-
ing dazed, Harry left. 
It was so late that the Gryffindor common room was almost 
empty. Harry went straight up to the dormitory. Ron wasn’t back 
yet. Harry pulled on his pajamas, go t into bed, and waited. Half an 
hour later, Ron arrived, nursing his right arm and bringing a strong 
smell of polish into the darkened room. 
“My muscles have all seized up,” he groaned, sinking on his bed. 
“Fourteen times he made me buff up that Quidditch Cup before he 
was satisfied. And then I had another slug attack all over a Special 
Award for Services to the School. Took ages to get the slime off. . . . 
How was it with Lockhart?” 
Keeping his voice low so as not to wake Neville, Dean, and Sea-
mus, Harry told Ron exactl y what he had heard. 
“And Lockhart said he couldn’t hear it?” said Ron. Harry could 
see him frowning in the moonlight. “D’you think he was lying? But I don’t get it — even someone invisible would’ve had to open 
the door.” 
“I know,” said Harry, lying back in his four-poster and staring at 
the canopy above him. “I don’t get it either.” 
C H A P T E R E I G H T 
 
 122  THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 
 
 
ctober arrived, spreading a damp chill over the grounds and into the castle. Madam Po mfrey, the nurs e, was kept 
busy by a sudden spate of colds among the staff and students. Her 
Pepperup Potion worked instantly, th ough it left the drinker smok-
ing at the ears for several hours afterward. Ginny Weasley, who had 
been looking pale, was bullied into taking some by Percy. The 
steam pouring from under her vivid hair gave the impression that 
her whole head was on fire. 
Raindrops the size of bullets th undered on the castle windows 
for days on end; the lake rose, the flower beds turned into muddy 
streams, and Hagrid’s pumpkins swe lled to the size of garden sheds. 
Oliver Wood’s enthusiasm for regula r training sessions, however, 
was not dampened, which was why Harr y was to be found, late one 
stormy Saturday afternoon a few days before Halloween, returning 
to Gryffindor Tower, drenched to th e skin and splattered with mud. 
 O 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 123  Even aside from the rain and wind it hadn’t been a happy prac-
tice session. Fred and George, wh o had been spying on the Slyth-
erin team, had seen for themselves the speed of those new Nimbus 
Two Thousand and Ones. They repo rted that the Slytherin team 
was no more than seve n greenish blurs, shooting through the air 
like missiles. 
As Harry squelched along the deserted corridor he came across 
somebody who looked ju st as preoccupied as he was. Nearly Head-
less Nick, the ghost of Gryffindor Tower, was staring morosely out 
of a window, muttering under his breath, “. . . don’t fulfill their re-quirements . . . half an inch, if that . . .” 
“Hello, Nick,” said Harry. 
“Hello, hello,” said Nearly Headless Nick, starting and looking 
round. He wore a dashing, plumed hat on his long curly hair, and a tunic with a ruff, which concealed the fact that his neck was al-
most completely severed. He was pale as smoke, and Harry could see right through him to the dark sky and torrential rain outside. 
“You look troubled, young Potte r,” said Nick, folding a trans-
parent letter as he spoke and tucking it inside his doublet. 
“So do you,” said Harry. 
“Ah,” Nearly Headless Nick waved an elegant hand, “a matter of 
no importance. . . . It’s not as though I really wanted to join. . . . 
Thought I’d apply, but apparently I ‘don’t fulfill requirements’ —” 
In spite of his airy tone, there was a look of great bitterness on 
his face. 
“But you would think, wouldn’t you,” he erupted suddenly, 
pulling the letter back out of his pocket, “that getting hit forty-five 
times in the neck with a blunt axe would qualify you to join the Headless Hunt?” 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 124  “Oh — yes,” said Harry, who was obviously supposed to agree. 
“I mean, nobody wishes more th an I do that it had all been 
quick and clean, and my head ha d come off properly, I mean, it 
would have saved me a great deal of pain and ridicule. However —” 
Nearly Headless Nick shook his letter open and read furiously: 
 
“‘We can only accept huntsmen whose heads have 
parted company with their bodies. You will appreciate 
that it would be impossible otherwise for members to 
participate in hunt activities such as Horseback Head-
Juggling and Head Polo. It is with the greatest regret, therefore, that I must inform you that you do not ful-fill our requirements. With very best wishes, Sir 
Patrick Delaney-Podmore .’ ” 
 
Fuming, Nearly Headless Nick stuffed the letter away. 
“Half an inch of skin and sinew holding my neck on, Harry! 
Most people would think that’s go od and beheaded, but oh, no, it’s 
not enough for Sir Proper ly Decapitated-Podmore.” 
Nearly Headless Nick took several deep breaths and then said, in 
a far calmer tone, “So — what’s bothering you? Anything I can do?” 
“No,” said Harry. “Not unless you know where we can get seven 
free Nimbus Two Thousand and Ones for our match against Sly —” 
The rest of Harry’s sentence was drowned out by a high-pitched 
mewling from somewhere near his ankles. He looked down and 
found himself gazing into a pair of lamp-like yellow eyes. It was 
Mrs. Norris, the skeletal gray cat who was used by the caretaker, Ar-
gus Filch, as a sort of deputy in his endless battle against students. 
“You’d better get out of here, Ha rry,” said Nick quickly. “Filch 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 125  isn’t in a good mood — he’s got th e flu and some third years acci-
dentally plastered frog brains all over the ceiling in dungeon five. 
He’s been cleaning all morning, and if he sees you dripping mud all 
over the place —” 
“Right,” said Harry, backing away from the accusing stare of Mrs. 
Norris, but not quickly enough. Drawn to the spot by the mysteri-
ous power that seemed to connect him with his foul cat, Argus Filch 
burst suddenly through a tapestry to Harry’s righ t, wheezing and 
looking wildly about for the rule-breaker. There was a thick tartan scarf bound around his head, and his nose was unusually purple. 
“Filth!” he shouted, his jowls aquiver, hi s eyes popping alarm-
ingly as he pointed at the mudd y puddle that ha d dripped from 
Harry’s Quidditch robe s. “Mess and muck ev erywhere! I’ve had 
enough of it, I tell yo u! Follow me, Potter!” 
So Harry waved a gloomy good-bye to Nearly Headless Nick and 
followed Filch back downstairs, doubling the number of muddy 
footprints on the floor. 
Harry had never been inside Filch’s office before; it was a place 
most students avoided. The room was dingy and windowless, lit by 
a single oil lamp dangling from the low ceiling. A faint smell of fried 
fish lingered about th e place. Wooden filing cabinets stood around 
the walls; from their labels, Harry could see that they contained de-
tails of every pupil Filch had ever punished. Fred and George 
Weasley had an entire drawer to themselves. A highly polished col-
lection of chains and manacles hu ng on the wall behind Filch’s desk. 
It was common knowle dge that he was always begging Dumbledore 
to let him suspend students by their ankles from the ceiling. 
Filch grabbed a quill from a pot on his desk and began shuffling 
around looking for parchment. 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 126  “Dung,” he muttered furiously, “gre at sizzling dragon bogies . . . 
frog brains . . . rat inte stines . . . I’ve had enough of it . . . make an 
example . . . where’s the fo rm . . . yes . . .” 
He retrieved a large roll of parc hment from his desk drawer and 
stretched it out in front of him, dipping his long black quill into the 
ink pot. 
“Name . . . Harry Potter. Crime . . .” 
“It was only a bit of mud!” said Harry. “It’s only a bit of mud to you, bo y, but to me it’s an extra hour 
scrubbing!” shouted Filch, a drip shivering unpleasantly at the end of his bulbous nose. “ Crime . . . befouling the castle . . . suggested 
sentence . . .” 
Dabbing at his streaming nose, Filch squinted unpleasantly at 
Harry, who waited with bated br eath for his sentence to fall. 
But as Filch lowered his quill, there was a great BANG! on the 
ceiling of the office, which made the oil lamp rattle. 
“PEEVES!” Filch roared, flinging down his quill in a transport of 
rage. “I’ll have you this time, I’ll have you!” 
And without a backward glance at Harry, Filch ran flat-footed 
from the office, Mrs. Norr is streaking alongside him. 
Peeves was the school poltergei st, a grinning, airborne menace 
who lived to cause havoc and di stress. Harry didn’t much like 
Peeves, but couldn’t help feeling grateful for his timing. Hope-fully, whatever Peeves had done (a nd it sounded as though he’d 
wrecked something very big this ti me) would distract Filch from 
Harry. 
T h i n k i n g t h a t h e s h o u l d p r o b a b l y w a i t f o r F i l c h t o c o m e b a c k , 
Harry sank into a moth-eaten chair next to the desk. There was only 
one thing on it apart from his half -completed form: a large, glossy, 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 127  purple envelope with silver lettering on the front. With a quick 
glance at the door to check that Filch wasn’t on his way back, Harry 
picked up the envelope and read: 
 
KWIKSPELL 
A Correspondence Course in Beginners’ Magic 
 Intrigued, Harry flicked the env elope open and pulled out the 
sheaf of parchment inside. More curly silver writing on the front 
page said: 
 
Feel out of step in the world of mo dern magic? Find yourself making 
excuses not to perform simple spells? Ever been taunted for your woe-
ful wandwork? There is an answer! 
 Kwikspell is an all-new, fail-saf e, quick-result, easy-learn course. 
Hundreds of witches and wizards h ave benefited from the Kwikspell 
method! Madam Z. Nettles of Topsham writes: 
“I had no memory for incantations and my potions were a family joke! 
Now, after a Kwikspell course, I am the center of attention at parties and friends beg for the recipe of my Scintillation Solution!” 
 
Warlock D. J. Prod of Didsbury says: 
“My wife used to sneer at my feeble charms, but one month into your fabulous Kwikspell course and I succ eeded in turning her into a yak! 
Thank you, Kwikspell!” 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 128  Fascinated, Harry thumbed through the rest of the envelope’s 
contents. Why on earth did Filch want a Kwikspell course? Did 
this mean he wasn ’t a proper wi zard? Harry was just reading “Les-
son One: Holding Your Wand (Some Useful Tips)” when shuffling 
footsteps outside told him Filch was coming back. Stuffing the 
parchment back into the envelope , Harry threw it back onto the 
desk just as the door opened. 
Filch was looking triumphant. 
“That vanishing cabinet was extrem ely valuable!” he was saying 
gleefully to Mrs. Norr is. “We’ll have Peeves out this time, my 
sweet —” 
His eyes fell on Harry and then darted to the Kwikspell enve-
lope, which, Harry realized too la te, was lying two feet away from 
where it had started. 
Filch’s pasty face went brick red. Harry braced himself for a tidal 
wave of fury. Filch hobbled across to his desk, snatched up the en-
velope, and threw it into a drawer. 
“Have you — did you read — ?” he sputtered. 
“No,” Harry lied quickly. 
Filch’s knobbly hands were twisting together. 
“If I thought you’d read my private — not that it’s mine — for a 
friend — be that as it may — however —” 
Harry was staring at him, alarmed; Filch had never looked mad-
der. His eyes were popping, a tic was going in one of his pouchy 
cheeks, and the tartan scarf didn’t help. 
“Very well — go — and don’t breathe a word — not that — 
however, if you didn’t read — go now, I have to write up Peeves’ re-
port — go —” 
 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 129  Amazed at his luck, Harry sped out of the office, up the corridor, 
and back upstairs. To escape from Filch’s office without punish-
ment was probably some kind of school record. 
“Harry! Harry! Di d it work?” 
Nearly Headless Nick came glid ing out of a classroom. Behind 
him, Harry could see the wreckage of a large black-and-gold cabi-
net that appeared to have been dropped from a great height. 
“I persuaded Peeves to crash it right over Filch’s office,” said 
Nick eagerly. “Thought it might distract him —” 
“Was that you?” said Harry gratefully. “Yeah, it worked, I didn’t 
even get detention. Thanks, Nick!” 
They set off up the corridor together. Nearly Headless Nick, 
Harry noticed, was still holding Sir Patrick’s re jection letter. 
“I wish there was something I could do for you about the Head-
less Hunt,” Harry said. 
Nearly Headless Nick stopped in his tracks and Harry walked 
right through him. He wished he hadn’t; it was like stepping through 
an icy shower. 
“But there is something you could do for me,” said Nick ex-
citedly. “Harry — would I be asking too much — but no, you 
wouldn’t want —” 
“What is it?” said Harry. 
“Well, this Halloween will be my five hundredth deathday,” said 
Nearly Headless Nick, drawing himself up and looking dignified. 
“Oh,” said Harry, not sure whet her he should look sorry or 
happy about this. “Right.” 
“I’m holding a party down in one of the roomier dungeons. 
Friends will be coming from all over the country. It would be such 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 130  an honor if you would attend. Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger 
would be most welcom e, too, of course — but I daresay you’d 
rather go to the school feast?” He watched Harry on tenterhooks. 
“No,” said Harry quic kly, “I’ll come —” 
“My dear boy! Harry Potter, at my deathday party! And” — 
he hesitated, looking excited — “do you think you could possibly 
mention to Sir Patrick how very frightening and impressive you 
find me?” 
“Of — of course,” said Harry. 
Nearly Headless Nick beamed at him. 
 
“A deathday party?” said Herm ione keenly wh en Harry had 
changed at last and joined her and Ron in the common room. “I 
bet there aren’t many living people who can say they’ve been to one 
of those — it’ll be fascinating!” 
“Why would anyone want to celebrate the day they died?” 
said Ron, who was halfway thro ugh his Potions homework and 
grumpy. “Sounds dead depr essing to me. . . .” 
Rain was still lashing the windows, which were now inky black, 
but inside all looked bright and ch eerful. The firelight glowed over 
the countless squashy armchairs wher e people sat reading, talking, 
doing homework or, in the case of Fred and George Weasley, trying 
to find out what would happen if yo u fed a Filibuster firework to a 
salamander. Fred had “rescued” the brilliant orange, fire-dwelling lizard from a Care of Magical Creatures class and it was now 
smoldering gently on a table surrounded by a knot of curious 
people. 
Harry was at the point of tellin g Ron and Hermione about Filch 
 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 131  and the Kwikspell course when th e salamander suddenly whizzed 
into the air, emitting loud sparks and bangs as it whirled wildly 
round the room. The si ght of Percy bellowing himself hoarse at 
Fred and George, the spectacular di splay of tangerine stars shower-
ing from the salamander’s mouth, an d its escape into the fire, with 
accompanying explosions, drove both Filch and the Kwikspell en-
velope from Harry’s mind. 
 
By the time Halloween arrived, Harry was regretting his rash 
promise to go to the deathday pa rty. The rest of the school was 
happily anticipating their Hallowee n feast; the Great Hall had been 
decorated with the usua l live bats, Hagrid’s vast pumpkins had 
been carved into lanterns large en ough for three men to sit in, and 
there were rumors that Dumbledore had booked a troupe of danc-ing skeletons for the entertainment. 
“A promise is a promise,” He rmione reminded Harry bossily. 
“You said you’d go to the deathday party.” 
So at seven o’clock, Harry, Ron, and Hermione walked straight 
past the doorway to the packed Great Hall, which was glittering 
invitingly with gold plates and ca ndles, and directed their steps in-
stead toward the dungeons. 
The passageway leading to Near ly Headless Nick’s party had 
been lined with candles, too, though the effe ct was far from cheer-
ful: These were long, thin, jet-blac k tapers, all burning bright blue, 
casting a dim, ghostly light even over their own living faces. The temperature dropped with every step they took. As Harry shivered 
and drew his robes tightly around him, he heard what sounded like 
a thousand fingernails scraping an enormous blackboard. 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 132  “Is that supposed to be music ?” Ron whispered. They turned a 
corner and saw Nearly Headless Nick standing at a doorway hung 
with black velvet drapes. 
“My dear friends,” he said mournfully. “Welcome, welcome . . . 
so pleased you could come. . . .” 
He swept off his plumed ha t and bowed them inside. 
It was an incredible sight. The dungeon was full of hundreds of 
pearly-white, translucent people, mo stly drifting around a crowded 
dance floor, waltzing to the drea dful, quavering sound of thirty 
musical saws, played by an orchestr a on a raised, black-draped plat-
form. A chandelier overhead blazed midnight-blue with a thou-
sand more black candles. Their breath rose in a mist before them; 
it was like stepping into a freezer. 
“Shall we have a look around?” Harry suggested, wanting to 
warm up his feet. 
“Careful not to walk through anyone,” said Ron nervously, and 
they set off around the edge of the dance floor. They passed a group 
of gloomy nuns, a ragged man wearing chains, and the Fat Friar, 
a cheerful Hufflepuff ghost, who was talking to a knight with an 
arrow sticking out of his forehead. Harry wasn’t surprised to see 
that the Bloody Baron, a gaunt, staring Slytherin ghost covered 
in silver bloodstains, was being given a wide berth by the other 
ghosts. 
“Oh, no,” said Hermione, stoppi ng abruptly. “Turn back, turn 
back, I don’t want to talk to Moaning Myrtle —” 
“Who?” said Harry as th ey backtracked quickly. 
“She haunts one of the toilets in the girls’ bathroom on the first 
floor,” said Hermione. 
“She haunts a toilet ?” 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 133  “Yes. It’s been out-of-order al l year because she keeps having 
tantrums and flooding th e place. I never went in there anyway if I 
could avoid it; it’s awfu l trying to have a pe e with her wailing at 
you —” 
“Look, food!” said Ron. 
On the other side of the dungeon was a long table, also covered 
in black velvet. They approached it eagerly but next moment had 
stopped in their tracks, horrified . The smell was quite disgusting. 
Large, rotten fish were laid on handsome silver platters; cakes, 
burned charcoal-black, were heaped on salvers; there was a great 
maggoty haggis, a slab of cheese co vered in furry green mold and, 
in pride of place, an enormous gr ay cake in the shape of a tomb-
stone, with tar-like ic ing forming the words, 
 
Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington 
died 31st October, 1492 
 
Harry watched, amazed, as a portly ghost approached the table, 
crouched low, and walked through it, his mouth held wide so that 
it passed through one of the stinking salmon. 
“Can you taste it if you walk through it?” Harry asked him. 
“Almost,” said the ghost sa dly, and he drifted away. 
“I expect they’ve let it rot to give it a stronger flavor,” said Her-
mione knowledgeably, pinching her nose and leaning closer to look 
at the putrid haggis. 
“Can we move? I feel sick,” said Ron. 
They had barely turned around , however, when a little man 
swooped suddenly from under the table and came to a halt in 
midair before them. 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 134  “Hello, Peeves,” said Harry cautiously. 
Unlike the ghosts around them, Peeves the Poltergeist was the 
very reverse of pale an d transparent. He was wearing a bright or-
ange party hat, a revolving bow ti e, and a broad grin on his wide, 
wicked face. 
“Nibbles?” he said sweetly, offer ing them a bowl of peanuts cov-
ered in fungus. 
“No thanks,” said Hermione. 
“Heard you talking about poor M yrtle,” said Peeves, his eyes 
dancing. “ Rude you was about poor Myrtle.” He took a deep breath 
and bellowed, “OY! MYRTLE!” 
“Oh, no, Peeves, don’t tell her what I said, she’ll be really upset,” 
Hermione whispered frantically. “I didn’t mean it, I don’t mind her — er, hello, Myrtle.” 
The squat ghost of a girl had gl ided over. She had the glummest 
face Harry had ever seen, half-hidd en behind lank hair and thick, 
pearly spectacles. 
“What?” she said sulkily. 
“How are you, Myrtle?” said Herm ione in a falsely bright voice. 
“It’s nice to see you out of the toilet.” 
Myrtle sniffed. 
“Miss Granger was just talking ab out you —” said Peeves slyly 
in Myrtle’s ear. 
“Just saying — saying — how nice you look tonight,” said Her-
mione, glaring at Peeves. 
Myrtle eyed Hermione suspiciously. “You’re making fun of me,” she sa id, silver tears welling rapidly 
in her small, see-through eyes. 
 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 135  “No — honestly — didn’t I just say how nice Myrtle’s looking?” 
said Hermione, nudging Harry an d Ron painfully in the ribs. 
“Oh, yeah —” 
“She did —” 
“Don’t lie to me,” Myrtle ga sped, tears now flooding down her 
face, while Peeves chuckled happ ily over her sh oulder. “D’you 
think I don’t know what people ca ll me behind my back? Fat Myr-
tle! Ugly Myrtle! Miserable, moaning, moping Myrtle!” 
“You’ve forgotten pimply,” Pe eves hissed in her ear. 
Moaning Myrtle burst into anguished sobs and fled from the 
dungeon. Peeves shot after her, pelting her with moldy peanuts, 
yelling, “ Pimply ! Pimply !” 
“Oh, dear,” said Hermione sadly. Nearly Headless Nick now drifted toward them through the 
crowd. 
“Enjoying yourselves?” “Oh, yes,” they lied. 
“Not a bad turnout,” said Nearly Headless Nick proudly. “The 
Wailing Widow came all the way up from Kent. . . . It’s nearly time 
for my speech, I’d be tter go and warn the orchestra. . . .” 
The orchestra, however, stoppe d playing at that very moment. 
They, and everyone else in the dung eon, fell silent, looking around 
in excitement, as a hunting horn sounded. 
“Oh, here we go,” said Nearly Headless Nick bitterly. 
Through the dungeon wall burst a dozen ghost horses, each 
ridden by a headless horseman. The assembly clapped wildly; 
Harry started to clap, too, but stoppe d quickly at the sight of Nick’s 
face. 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 136  The horses galloped into the middle of the dance floor and 
halted, rearing and plunging. At th e front of the pack was a large 
ghost who held his bearded head under his arm, from which posi-
tion he was blowing the horn. Th e ghost leapt down, lifted his 
head high in the air so he co uld see over the crowd (everyone 
laughed), and strode over to Near ly Headless Nick, squashing his 
head back onto his neck. 
“Nick!” he roared. “How are you? Head still hanging in there?” 
He gave a hearty guffaw and clapped Nearly Headless Nick on 
the shoulder. 
“Welcome, Patrick,” said Nick stiffly. “Live ’uns!” said Sir Patrick, sp otting Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
and giving a huge, fake jump of as tonishment, so that his head fell 
off again (the crowd howled with laughter). 
“Very amusing,” sa id Nearly Headless Nick darkly. 
“Don’t mind Nick!” shouted Sir Patrick’s head from the floor. 
“Still upset we won’t let him join the Hunt! But I mean to say — 
look at the fellow —” 
“I think,” said Harry hurriedly, at a meaningful look from Nick, 
“Nick’s very — fright ening and — er —” 
“Ha!” yelled Sir Patrick’s head. “Bet he asked you to say that!” “If I could have everyone’s attent ion, it’s time for my speech!” 
said Nearly Headless Nick loudly, striding toward the podium and climbing into an ic y blue spotlight. 
“My late lamented lords, ladies, and gentlemen, it is my great 
sorrow . . .” 
But nobody heard much more. Si r Patrick and the rest of the 
Headless Hunt had just started a game of Head Hockey and the 
crowd were turning to watch. Nearly Headless Nick tried vainly to 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 137  recapture his audience, but gave up as Sir Patrick’s head went sail-
ing past him to loud cheers. 
Harry was very cold by no w, not to mention hungry. 
“I can’t stand much more of this ,” Ron muttered, his teeth chat-
tering, as the orchestra ground ba ck into action and the ghosts 
swept back onto the dance floor. 
“Let’s go,” Harry agreed. 
They backed toward the door, n odding and beaming at anyone 
who looked at them, and a minute later were hurrying back up the 
passageway full of black candles. 
“Pudding might not be finished yet,” said Ron hopefully, lead-
ing the way toward the steps to the entrance hall. 
And then Harry heard it. 
“. . . rip . . . tear . . . kill . . .” 
It was the same voice, the same cold, murderous voice he had 
heard in Lockhart’s office. 
He stumbled to a halt, clutching at the stone wall, listening with 
all his might, looking around, sq uinting up and down the dimly lit 
passageway. 
“Harry, what’re you — ?” 
“It’s that voice again — shut up a minute —” 
“. . . soo hungry . . . for so long . . .” 
“Listen!” said Harry urgently, and Ron and Hermione froze, 
watching him. 
“. . . kill . . . time to kill . . .” 
The voice was growing fainter. Harry was sure it was moving 
away — moving upward. A mixture of fear and excitement gripped 
him as he stared at the dark ceil ing; how could it be moving up-
ward? Was it a phantom, to whom stone ceilings didn’t matter? 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 138  “This way,” he shouted, and he began to run, up the stairs, into 
the entrance hall. It was no good ho ping to hear anything here, the 
babble of talk from the Hallowe en feast was echoing out of the 
Great Hall. Harry sprinted up the ma rble staircase to the first floor, 
Ron and Hermione clattering behind him. 
“Harry, what’re we —” 
“SHH!” 
Harry strained his ears. Distantl y, from the floor above, and 
growing fainter still, he heard the voice: “. . . I smell blood. . . . I 
SMELL BLOOD!” 
His stomach lurched — 
“It’s going to kill someone!” he shouted, and ignoring Ron’s and 
H e r m i o n e ’ s b e w i l d e r e d f a c e s , h e r a n u p t h e n e x t f l i g h t o f s t e p s three at a time, trying to listen over his own pounding footsteps — 
Harry hurtled around the whole of the second floor, Ron and 
Hermione panting behind him, not stopping until they turned a corner into the last, deserted passage. 
“Harry, what was that all about?” said Ron, wiping sweat off his 
face. “I couldn’t he ar anything. . . .” 
But Hermione gave a sudden gasp, pointing down the corridor. 
“Look !” 
Something was shining on the wall ahead. They approached 
slowly, squinting through the dark ness. Foot-high words had been 
daubed on the wall between two wi ndows, shimmering in the light 
cast by the flaming torches. 
 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS HAS BEEN 
OPENED. ENEMIES OF THE HEIR, BEWARE. 
 
THE DEATHDAY PARTY 
 139  “What’s that thing — hanging underneath?” said Ron, a slight 
quiver in his voice. 
As they edged nearer, Harry almo st slipped — there was a large 
puddle of water on the floor; Ron and Hermione grabbed him, and 
they inched toward the message, ey es fixed on a dark shadow be-
neath it. All three of them realized what it was at once, and leapt 
backward with a splash. 
Mrs. Norris, the caretaker’s cat, was hanging by her tail from the 
torch bracket. She was stiff as a board, her eyes wide and staring. 
For a few seconds, they didn’t move. Then Ron said, “Let’s get 
out of here.” 
“Shouldn’t we try and help —” Harry began awkwardly. 
“Trust me,” said Ron. “We don’t want to be found here.” 
But it was too late. A rumble, as though of distant thunder, told 
them that the feast had just ended . From either end of the corridor 
where they stood came the sound of hundreds of feet climbing the stairs, and the loud, happy talk of well-fed people; next moment, 
students were crashing into the passage from both ends. 
The chatter, the bustle, the noise died suddenly as the people in 
front spotted the hanging cat. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood 
alone, in the middle of the corrid or, as silence fell among the mass 
of students pressing forward to see the grisly sight. 
Then someone shouted through the quiet. “Enemies of the Heir, beware! You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” It was Draco Malfoy. He had pushed to the front of the crowd, 
his cold eyes alive, his usually blo odless face flushed, as he grinned 
at the sight of the hanging, immobile cat. 
C H A P T E R N I N E

hat’s going on here? What’s going on?” 
Attracted no doubt by Malfoy’s shout, Argus Filch 
came shouldering his way throug h the crowd. Then he saw Mrs. 
Norris and fell back, clut ching his face in horror. 
“My cat! My cat! What’s happened to Mrs. Norris?” he shrieked. 
And his popping eyes fell on Harry. 
“You!” he screeched. “ You! You’ve murdered my cat! You’ve killed 
her! I’ll kill you! I’ll —” 
“Argus !” 
Dumbledore had arrived on the scene, followed by a number of 
other teachers. In seconds, he had swept past Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione and detached Mrs. Norris from the torch bracket. 
“Come with me, Argus,” he said to Filch. “You, too, Mr. Potter, 
Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger.” 
Lockhart stepped forward eagerly. 
 W 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 141  “My office is nearest, Headmaster — just upstairs — please feel 
free —” 
“Thank you, Gilderoy ,” said Dumbledore. 
The silent crowd parted to let them pass. Lockha rt, looking ex-
cited and important, hurried afte r Dumbledore; so did Professors 
McGonagall and Snape. 
As they entered Lockhart’s darken ed office there was a flurry of 
movement across the walls; Harry saw several of the Lockharts in 
the pictures dodging out of sight, their hair in rollers. The real 
Lockhart lit the candles on his desk and stood back. Dumbledore 
laid Mrs. Norris on the polished surface and began to examine her. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange d tense looks an d sank into 
chairs outside the pool of candlelight, watching. 
The tip of Dumbledore’s long, crook ed nose was barely an inch 
from Mrs. Norris’s fur. He was lo oking at her closely through his 
half-moon spectacles, his long fi ngers gently prodding and poking. 
Professor McGonagall was bent almo st as close, her eyes narrowed. 
Snape loomed behind them, half in shadow, wearing a most pecu-
liar expression: It was as though he was trying hard not to smile. 
And Lockhart was hovering around all of them, making sugges-
tions. 
“It was definitely a curse that killed her — probably the Trans-
mogrifian Torture — I’ve seen it used many times, so unlucky I 
wasn’t there, I know the very countercurse that would have saved her. . . .” 
Lockhart’s comments were punctu ated by Filch’s dry, racking 
sobs. He was slumped in a chair by the desk, unable to look at Mrs. Norris, his face in his hands. Much as he detested Filch, Harry 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 142  couldn’t help feeling a bit sorry fo r him, though not nearly as sorry 
as he felt for himself. If Dumbledore believed Filch, he would be 
expelled for sure. 
Dumbledore was now muttering strange words under his breath 
and tapping Mrs. Norris with his wand but nothing happened: She 
continued to look as though she had been recently stuffed. 
“. . . I remember something very similar happening in Oua-
gadogou,” said Lockhart, “a series of attacks, the full story’s in my 
autobiography, I was able to provide the townsfolk with various 
amulets, which cleared the ma tter up at once. . . .” 
The photographs of Lockhart on the walls were all nodding in 
agreement as he talked. One of th em had forgotten to remove his 
hair net. 
At last Dumbledore straightened up. “She’s not dead, Argus,” he said softly. 
Lockhart stopped abruptly in the middle of counting the num-
ber of murders he had prevented. 
“Not dead?” choked Filch, looking through his fingers at Mrs. 
Norris. “But why’s she all — all stiff and frozen?” 
“She has been Petrified,” said Dumbledore (“Ah! I thought so!” 
said Lockhart). “But how, I cannot say. . . .” 
“Ask him!” shrieked Filch, turning his blotched and tearstained 
face to Harry. 
“No second year could have done this,” said Dumbledore firmly. 
“It would take Dark Magic of the most advanced —” 
“He did it, he did it!” Filch spat, his pouchy face purpling. “You 
saw what he wrote on the wall! He found — in my office — he 
knows I’m a — I’m a —” Filch’s fa ce worked horribly. “He knows 
I’m a Squib!” he finished. 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 143  “I never touched Mrs. Norris!” Harry said loudly, uncomfortably 
aware of everyone looking at him , including all the Lockharts on 
the walls. “And I don’t even know what a Squib is.” 
“Rubbish!” snarled Filch. “He saw my Kwikspell letter!” 
“If I might speak, Headmaster,” said Snape from the shadows, 
and Harry’s sense of foreboding increased; he was sure nothing 
Snape had to say was going to do him any good. 
“Potter and his friends may have simply been in the wrong place 
at the wrong time,” he said, a sl ight sneer curling his mouth as 
though he doubted it. “But we do have a set of suspicious circum-
stances here. Why was he in the upst airs corridor at all? Why wasn’t 
he at the Halloween feast?” 
Harry, Ron and Hermione all la unched into an explanation 
about the deathday part y . “ . . . t h e r e w e r e h u n d r e d s o f g h o s t s , 
they’ll tell you we were there —” 
“But why not join the feast afterward?” said Snape, his black eyes 
glittering in the candlelight. “Why go up to that corridor?” 
Ron and Hermione lo oked at Harry. 
“Because — because —” Harry said, his heart thumping very 
fast; something told him it woul d sound very far-fetched if he 
told them he had been led there by a bodiless voice no one but he 
could hear, “because we were tire d and wanted to go to bed,” he 
said. 
“Without any supper?” said Snape, a triumphant smile flicker-
ing across his gaunt face. “I didn’t think ghosts provided food fit for 
living people at their parties.” 
“We weren’t hungry,” said Ron loudly as his stomach gave a huge 
rumble. 
Snape’s nasty smile widened. 
CHAPTER NINE 
 144  “I suggest, Headmaster, that Po tter is not being entirely truth-
ful,” he said. “It might be a good idea if he were deprived of certain 
privileges until he is ready to te ll us the whole stor y. I personally 
feel he should be taken off the Gr yffindor Quidditch team until he 
is ready to be honest.” 
“Really, Severus,” said Professor McGonagall sharply, “I see no 
reason to stop the boy playing Quidditch. This cat wasn’t hit over 
the head with a broomstick. There is no evidence at all that Potter 
has done anything wrong.” 
Dumbledore was giving Harry a se arching look. His twinkling 
light-blue gaze made Harry feel as though he were being X-rayed. 
“Innocent until proven guilty , Severus,” he said firmly. 
Snape looked furious. So did Filch. 
“My cat has been Petrified!” he shrieked, his eyes popping. “I 
want to see some punishment !” 
“We will be able to cure her, Argus,” said Dumbledore patiently. 
“Professer Sprout recently mana ged to procure some Mandrakes. 
As soon as they have reached their full size, I will have a potion 
made that will revive Mrs. Norris.” 
“I’ll make it,” Lockhart butted in . “I must have done it a hun-
dred times. I could whip up a Mandrake Restorative Draught in 
my sleep —” 
“Excuse me,” said Snape icily. “But I believe I am the Potions 
master at this school.” 
There was a very awkward pause. 
“You may go,” Dumbledore said to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 
They went, as quickly as they could without actually running. 
When they were a floor up from Lock hart’s office, they turned into 
 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 145  an empty classroom and closed the door quietly behind them. 
Harry squinted at his friends’ darkened faces. 
“D’you think I should have told them about that voice I heard?” 
“No,” said Ron, without hesitation . “Hearing voices no one else 
can hear isn’t a good sign, ev en in the wizarding world.” 
Something in Ron’s voice made Harry ask, “You do believe me, 
don’t you?” 
“ ’Course I do,” said Ron quickly. “But — you must admit it’s 
weird. . . .” 
“I know it’s weird,” said Har ry. “The whole thing’s weird. 
What was that writing on the wa ll about? ‘The Chamber Has Been 
Opened’. . . . What’s th at supposed to mean?” 
“You know, it rings a sort of bell,” said Ron slowly. “I think 
someone told me a story about a secret chamber at Hogwarts 
once . . . might’ve been Bill. . . .” 
“And what on earth’s a Squib?” said Harry. 
To his surprise, Ron stifled a snigger. “Well — it’s not funny really — but as it’s Filch,” he said. “A 
Squib is someone who was born into a wizarding family but hasn’t 
got any magic powers. Kind of th e opposite of Muggle-born wiz-
ards, but Squibs are quite unusual. If Filch’s trying to learn magic 
from a Kwikspell course, I reckon he must be a Squib. It would ex-
plain a lot. Like why he hates st udents so much.” Ron gave a satis-
fied smile. “He’s bitter.” 
A clock chimed somewhere. “Midnight,” said Harry. “We’d better get to bed before Snape 
comes along and tries to frame us for something else.” 
* * * 
CHAPTER NINE 
 146  For a few days, the school could talk of little else but the attack on 
Mrs. Norris. Filch kept it fresh in everyone’s minds by pacing the 
spot where she had been attacked , a s t h o u g h h e thought the at-
tacker might come back. Harry had seen him scrubbing the mes-s a g e o n t h e w a l l w i t h M r s . S k o w e r ’ s A l l - P u r p o s e M a g i c a l M e s s 
Remover, but to no ef fect; the words still gleamed as brightly as 
ever on the stone. When Filch wa sn’t guarding the scene of the 
crime, he was skulking red-eyed through the corridors, lunging out 
at unsuspecting students and trying to put them in detention for 
things like “breat hing loudly” and “looking happy.” 
Ginny Weasley seemed very distur bed by Mrs. Norris’s fate. Ac-
cording to Ron, she was a great cat lover. 
“But you haven’t really got to know Mrs. Norris,” Ron told her 
bracingly. “Honestly, we’re much better off without her.” Ginny’s 
lip trembled. “Stuff like this doe sn’t often happen at Hogwarts,” 
Ron assured her. “They’ll catch the maniac who did it and have 
him out of here in no time. I just hope he’s got time to Petrify Filch 
before he’s expelled. I’m only joking —” Ron added hastily as 
Ginny blanched. 
The attack had also had an effe ct on Hermione. It was quite 
usual for Hermione to spend a lot of time reading, but she was now 
doing almost nothing else. Nor co uld Harry and Ron get much re-
sponse from her when they asked what she was up to, and not un-til the following Wednesday did they find out. 
Harry had been held back in Potions, where Snape had made 
him stay behind to scrape tubewo rms off the desks. After a hurried 
lunch, he went upstairs to meet Ron in the library, and saw Jus-
tin Finch-Fletchley, the Hufflepu ff boy from Herbology, coming 
 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 147  toward him. Harry had just opened his mouth to say hello when 
Justin caught sight of him, turned abruptly, and sped off in the op-
posite direction. 
Harry found Ron at the back of the library, measuring his His-
tory of Magic homework. Professor Binns had asked for a three-foot-long composition on “The Me dieval Assembly of European 
Wizards.” 
“I don’t believe it, I’m still eight inches short. . . .” said Ron fu-
riously, letting go of his parchmen t, which sprang back into a roll. 
“And Hermione’s done four feet se ven inches and her writing’s 
tiny.” 
“Where is she?” asked Harry, grab bing the tape measure and un-
rolling his own homework. 
“Somewhere over there,” said Ro n, pointing along the shelves. 
“Looking for another book. I think she’s trying to read the whole library before Christmas.” 
Harry told Ron about Justin Finc h-Fletchley running away from 
him. 
“Dunno why you care. I thought he was a bit of an idiot,” said 
Ron, scribbling away, making his wr iting as large as possible. “All 
that junk about Lockha rt being so great —” 
Hermione emerged from between the bookshelves. She looked 
irritable and at la st seemed ready to talk to them. 
“All the copies of Hogwarts, A History have been taken out,” she 
said, sitting down next to Harry and Ron. “And there’s a two-week 
waiting list. I wish I hadn’t left my copy at home, but I couldn’t fit 
it in my trunk with all the Lockhart books.” 
“Why do you want it?” said Harry. 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 148  “The same reason everyone else wants it,” said Hermione, “to 
read up on the legend of the Chamber of Secrets.” 
“What’s that?” said Harry quickly. 
“That’s just it. I can’t remember,” said Hermione, biting her lip. 
“And I can’t find the st ory anywhere else —” 
“Hermione, let me read your composition,” said Ron desper-
ately, checking his watch. 
“No, I won’t,” said Hermione, suddenly severe. “You’ve had ten 
days to finish it —” 
“I only need another two inches, come on —” The bell rang. Ron and Hermione led the way to History of 
Magic, bickering. 
History of Magic was the dullest subject on their schedule. Pro-
fessor Binns, who taught it, was their only ghost teacher, and the 
most exciting thing that ever happ ened in his clas ses was his enter-
ing the room through the blackboa rd. Ancient and shriveled, many 
people said he hadn’t noticed he was dead. He had simply got up to 
teach one day and left his body behi nd him in an armchair in front 
of the staffroom fire; his routine had not varied in the slightest 
since. 
Today was as boring as ever. Professor Binns opened his notes 
and began to read in a flat drone like an old vacuum cleaner until 
nearly everyone in the class was in a deep stupor, occasionally com-
i n g t o l o n g e n o u g h t o c o p y d o w n a n a m e o r d a t e , t h e n f a l l i n g 
asleep again. He had been speaki ng for half an hour when some-
thing happened that had never ha ppened before. Hermione put up 
her hand. 
Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lec- 
 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 149  ture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289, looked 
amazed. 
“Miss — er — ?” 
“Granger, Professor. I was wond ering if you could tell us any-
thing about the Chamber of Secrets,” said Hermione in a clear voice. 
Dean Thomas, who ha d been sitting with his mouth hanging 
open, gazing out of the window, jerked out of his trance; Lavender Brown’s head came up off her ar ms and Neville Longbottom’s el-
bow slipped off his desk. 
Professor Binns blinked. “My subject is History of Magic,” he said in his dry, wheezy 
voice. “I deal with, facts, Miss Granger, not myths and legends.” He 
cleared his throat with a small no ise like chalk snapping and con-
tinued, “In September of that year, a subcommittee of Sardinian sorcerers —” 
He stuttered to a halt. Hermione’ s hand was waving in the air 
again. 
“Miss Grant?” 
“Please, sir, don’t legends always have a basis in fact?” 
Professor Binns was looking at her in such amazement, Harry 
was sure no student had ever inte rrupted him before, alive or dead. 
“Well,” said Professor Binns slowly, “yes, one could argue that, I 
suppose.” He peered at Hermione as though he had never seen a 
student properly before. “However , the legend of which you speak 
is such a very sensational, even ludicrous tale —” 
But the whole class was now hanging on Professor Binns’s every 
word. He looked dimly at them all, every face turned to his. Harry 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 150  could tell he was completely thrown by such an unusual show of 
interest. 
“Oh, very well,” he said slowly. “Let me see . . . the Chamber of 
Secrets . . . 
“You all know, of course, that Hogwarts was founded over a 
thousand years ago — the precise date is uncertain — by the four 
greatest witches and wizards of the age. The four school Houses are 
named after them: Godric Gryffi ndor, Helga Hufflepuff, Rowena 
Ravenclaw, and Salazar Slytherin. They built this castle together, 
far from prying Muggle eyes, fo r it was an age when magic was 
feared by common people, and witc hes and wizards suffered much 
persecution.” 
He paused, gazed blea rily around the room, and continued. 
“For a few years, the founders worked in harmony together, 
seeking out youngsters who showed signs of magic and bringing 
them to the castle to be educat ed. But then disagreements sprang 
up between them. A rift began to grow between Slytherin and the 
others. Slytherin wished to be more selective about the students ad-
mitted to Hogwarts. He believed that magical learning should be 
kept within all-magic families. He disliked taking students of Mug-
gle parentage, believing them to be untrustworthy. After a while, 
there was a serious argument on the subject between Slytherin and 
Gryffindor, and Slytheri n left the school.” 
Professor Binns paused again, pu rsing his lips, looking like a 
wrinkled old tortoise. 
“Reliable historical sources tell us this much,” he said. “But these 
honest facts have been obscured by the fanciful legend of the Chamber of Secrets. The story go es that Slytherin had built a 
 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 151  hidden chamber in the castle, of which the other founders knew 
nothing. 
“Slytherin, according to the lege nd, sealed the Chamber of Se-
crets so that none would be able to open it until hi s own true heir 
arrived at the school. The heir al one would be able to unseal the 
Chamber of Secrets, un leash the horror within, and use it to purge 
the school of all who were unworthy to study magic.” 
There was silence as he finished te lling the story, but it wasn’t the 
usual, sleepy silence that filled Pr ofessor Binns’s classes. There was 
unease in the air as everyone cont inued to watch him, hoping for 
more. Professor Binns l ooked faintly annoyed. 
“The whole thing is arrant nonsense, of course,” he said. “Natu-
rally, the school has been searched for evidence of such a chamber, 
many times, by the most learned witches and wizards. It does not 
exist. A tale told to frighten the gullible.” 
Hermione’s hand was back in the air. 
“Sir — what exactly do you mean by the ‘horror within’ the 
Chamber?” 
“That is believed to be some sort of monster, which the Heir of 
Slytherin alone can control,” said Professor Binns in his dry, reedy 
voice. 
The class exchange d nervous looks. 
“I tell you, the thing does not ex ist,” said Professor Binns, shuf-
fling his notes. “There is no Chamber and no monster.” 
“But, sir,” said Seamus Finnigan, “if the Chamber can only be 
opened by Slytherin’s true heir, no one else would be able to find it, 
would they?” 
“Nonsense, O’Flaherty,” said Professor Binns in an aggravated 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 152  tone. “If a long succession of Hogwarts headmasters and head-
mistresses haven’t found the thing —” 
“But, Professor,” piped up Parvati Patil, “you’d probably have to 
use Dark Magic to open it —” 
“Just because a wizard doesn’t use Dark Magic doesn’t mean he 
can’t, Miss Pennyfeather,” snapped Pro fessor Binns. “I repeat, if the 
likes of Dumbledore —” 
“But maybe you’ve got to be re lated to Slytherin, so Dumble-
dore couldn’t —” began Dean Thomas, but Professor Binns had had enough. 
“That will do,” he said sharply. “It is a myth! It does not exist! 
There is not a shred of evidence th at Slytherin ever built so much 
as a secret broom cupboard! I regret telling you such a foolish story! 
We will return, if you please, to history, to solid, believable, verifi-
able fact!” 
And within five minutes, the class had sunk back into its usual 
torpor. 
 
“I always knew Salazar Slytherin was a twisted old loony,” Ron told 
Harry and Hermione as they fought their way through the teeming 
corridors at the end of the lesson to drop off their bags before 
dinner. “But I never knew he star ted all this pure-blood stuff. I 
wouldn’t be in his House if you paid me. Honestly, if the Sorting 
Hat had tried to put me in Slytheri n, I’d’ve got the train straight 
back home. . . .” 
Hermione nodded fervently, but Harry didn’t say anything. His 
stomach had just dr opped unpleasantly. 
Harry had never told Ron and Hermione that the Sorting Hat 
 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 153  had seriously considered putting him in Slytherin. He could re-
member, as though it were yester day, the small voice that had spo-
ken in his ear when he’d placed th e hat on his head a year before: 
You could be great, you know, it’s all here in your head, and Slytherin 
would help you on the way to greatness, no doubt about that. . . . 
But Harry, who had already heard of Slytherin House’s reputa-
tion for turning out Dark wizards, had thought desperately, Not 
Slytherin ! and the hat had said, Oh, well, if you’re sure . . . better be 
Gryffindor. . . . 
As they were shunted along in the throng, Colin Creevey went 
past. 
“Hiya, Harry!” “Hullo, Colin,” said Harry automatically. 
“Harry — Harry — a boy in my class has been saying you’re —” But Colin was so small he couldn’t fight against the tide of 
people bearing him toward the Great Hall; they heard him squeak, 
“See you, Harry!” and he was gone. 
“What’s a boy in his class saying about you?” Hermione won-
dered. 
“That I’m Slytherin’s heir, I ex pect,” said Ha rry, his stomach 
dropping another inch or so as he suddenly remembered the way Justin Finch-Fletchley had run away from him at lunchtime. 
“People here’ll believe anythin g,” said Ron in disgust. 
The crowd thinned and they were able to climb the next stair-
case without difficulty. 
“D’you really think there’s a Chamber of Secrets?” Ron asked 
Hermione. 
“I don’t know,” she said, frowning. “Dumbledore couldn’t cure 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 154  Mrs. Norris, and that makes me th ink that whatever attacked her 
might not be — well — human.” 
As she spoke, they turned a corner and found themselves at the 
end of the very corridor where the attack had happened. They 
stopped and looked. The scene was just as it had been that night, 
except that there was no stiff ca t hanging from th e torch bracket, 
and an empty chair stood against the wall bearing the message “The Chamber of Secret s Has Been Opened.” 
“That’s where Filch has been keeping guard,” Ron muttered. 
They looked at each other. The corridor was deserted. 
“ C a n ’ t h u r t t o h a v e a p o k e a r o u n d , ” s a i d H a r r y , d r o p p i n g h i s 
bag and getting to his hands and knees so that he could crawl 
along, searching for clues. 
“Scorch marks!” he said. “Here — and here —” “Come and look at this!” said Hermione. “This is funny. . . .” 
Harry got up and crossed to the window next to the message 
on the wall. Hermione was pointi ng at the topmost pane, where 
around twenty spiders were scuttling, apparently fighting to get 
through a small crack. A long, silvery thread was dangling like a 
rope, as though they ha d all climbed it in thei r hurry to get outside. 
“Have you ever seen spiders act li ke that?” said Hermione won-
deringly. 
“No,” said Harry, “h ave you, Ron? Ron?” 
He looked over his shoulder. Ron was standing well back and 
seemed to be fighting the impulse to run. 
“What’s up?” said Harry. 
“I — don’t — like — spid ers,” said Ron tensely. 
“I never knew that,” said Hermio ne, looking at Ron in surprise. 
“You’ve used spiders in Poti ons loads of times. . . .” 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 155  “I don’t mind them dead,” said Ron, who was carefully look-
ing anywhere but at the window. “I just don’t like the way they 
move. . . .” 
Hermione giggled. 
“It’s not funny,” said Ron, fier cely. “If you must know, when I 
was three, Fred turned my — my te ddy bear into a great big filthy 
spider because I broke his toy broomstick. . . . You wouldn’t like them either if you’d been holding your bear and suddenly it had 
too many legs and . . .” 
He broke off, shuddering. Hermione was obviously still trying 
not to laugh. Feeling they had bett er get off the subject, Harry said, 
“Remember all that water on the floor? Where did that come from? 
Someone’s mopped it up.” 
“It was about here,” said Ron, re covering himself to walk a few 
paces past Filch’s ch air and pointing. “Lev el with this door.” 
He reached for the brass doorknob but suddenly withdrew his 
hand as though he’d been burned. 
“What’s the matter?” said Harry. 
“Can’t go in there,” said Ron gr uffly. “That’s a girls’ toilet.” 
“Oh, Ron, there won’t be anyo ne in there,” said Hermione, 
standing up and coming over. “That’s Moaning Myrtle’s place. 
Come on, let’s have a look.” 
And ignoring the large out of order sign, she opened the door. 
It was the gloomiest, most depressing bathroom Harry had ever 
set foot in. Under a large, cracke d, and spotted mirror were a row 
of chipped sinks. The floor was damp and reflected the dull light 
given off by the stubs of a few ca ndles, burning low in their hold-
ers; the wooden doors to the stalls were flaking and scratched and 
one of them was dangling off its hinges. 
CHAPTER NINE 
 156  Hermione put her fingers to her lips and set off toward the end 
stall. When she reached it she sa id, “Hello, Myrtle, how are you?” 
Harry and Ron went to look. Moan ing Myrtle was floating above 
the tank of the to ilet, picking a spot on her chin. 
“This is a girls’ bathroom,” she said, eyeing Ron and Harry sus-
piciously. “ They ’re not girls.” 
“No,” Hermione agreed. “I just wanted to show them how — 
er — nice it is in here.” 
She waved vaguely at the dirty old mirror and the damp floor. 
“Ask her if she saw anything,” Harry mouthed at Hermione. 
“What are you whispering?” sa id Myrtle, staring at him. 
“Nothing,” said Harry quickly. “We wanted to ask —” 
“I wish people would stop talkin g behind my back!” said Myrtle, 
in a voice choked with tears. “I do have feelings, you know, even if 
I am dead —” 
“Myrtle, no one wants to upse t you,” said Hermione. “Harry 
only —” 
“No one wants to upset me! That’s a good one!” howled Myrtle. 
“My life was nothing but misery at this place and now people come 
along ruining my death!” 
“We wanted to ask you if you’ve seen anything funny lately,” 
said Hermione quickly. “Because a cat was attacked right outside 
your front door on Halloween.” 
“Did you see anyone near here that night?” said Harry. 
“I wasn’t paying attention,” said Myrtle dramatically. “Peeves 
upset me so much I came in here and tried to kill myself. Then, of 
course, I remembered that I’m — that I’m —” 
“Already dead,” said Ron helpfully.

dived headfirst into the toilet, splashing water all over them and 
vanishing from sight, although fr om the direction of her muffled 
sobs, she had come to rest somewhere in the U-bend. 
Harry and Ron stood with thei r mouths open, but Hermione 
shrugged wearily and said, “Honestl y, that was almost cheerful for 
Myrtle. . . . Come on, let’s go.” 
Harry had barely closed the door on Myrtle’s gurgling sobs when 
a loud voice made all three of them jump. 
“RON!” Percy Weasley had stopped dead at the head of the stairs, prefect 
badge agleam, an expression of complete shock on his face. 
“That’s a girls’ bathroom!” he gasped. “What were you — ?” 
“Just having a look around,” Ron shrugged. “Clues, you 
know —” 
Percy swelled in a manner that reminded Harry forcefully of 
Mrs. Weasley. 
“Get — away — from — there —” Percy said, striding toward 
them and starting to bustle them along, flapping his arms. “Don’t 
you care what this looks like? Coming back here while everyone’s at 
dinner —” 
“Why shouldn’t we be here?” sa id Ron hotly, stopping short and 
glaring at Percy. “Lis ten, we never laid a finger on that cat!” 
“That’s what I told Ginny,” said Percy fiercely, “but she still 
seems to think you’re going to be expelled, I’ve never seen her so 
upset, crying her eyes out, you might think of her, all the first years 
are thoroughly overexcite d by this business —” 
“You don’t care about Ginny,” said Ron, whose ears were now 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 158  reddening. “ You’re just worried I’m going to mess up your chances 
of being Head Boy —” 
“Five points from Gryffindor!” Percy said tersely, fingering his 
prefect badge. “And I hope it teaches you a lesson! No more detec-
tive work, or I’ll write to Mum!” 
And he strode off, th e back of his neck as red as Ron’s ears. 
 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione chose seats as far as possible from Percy 
in the common room that night. Ron was still in a very bad tem-
per and kept blotting his Charms homework. When he reached absently for his wand to remove the smudges, it ignited the parch-ment. Fuming almost as much as his homework, Ron slammed 
The Standard Book of Spells, Grade 2 shut. To Harry’s surprise, 
Hermione followed suit. 
“Who can it be, though?” she said in a quiet voice, as though 
continuing a conversation they had just been having. “Who’d want 
to frighten all the Squibs and Muggle-borns out of Hogwarts?” 
“Let’s think,” said Ron in mock puzzlement. “Who do we know 
who thinks Muggle-b orns are scum?” 
He looked at Hermione. Hermione looked back, unconvinced. 
“If you’re talking about Malfoy —” 
“Of course I am!” said Ron. “You heard him — ‘ You’ll be next, 
Mudbloods !’ — come on, you’ve only got to look at his foul rat face 
to know it’s him —” 
“Malfoy, the Heir of Slytheri n?” said Hermione skeptically. 
“Look at his family,” said Harry, closing his books, too. “The 
whole lot of them have been in Slytherin; he’s always boasting 
about it. They could easily be Slytherin’s descendants. His father’s 
definitely evil enough.” 
THE WRITING ON THE WALL 
 159  “They could’ve had the key to the Chamber of Secrets for cen-
turies!” said Ron. “Handing it down, father to son. . . .” 
“Well,” said Hermione cautiously, “I suppose it’s possible. . . .” 
“But how do we prove it?” said Harry darkly. 
“There might be a way,” said Hermione slowly, dropping her 
voice still further with a quick glan ce across the room at Percy. “Of 
course, it would be difficult. An d dangerous, very dangerous. We’d 
be breaking about fifty school rules, I expect —” 
“If, in a month or so, you feel li ke explaining, you will let us 
know, won’t you?” said Ron irritably. 
“All right,” said Hermione coldly . “What we’d need to do is to 
get inside the Slytherin common room and ask Malfoy a few ques-
tions without him re alizing it’s us.” 
“But that’s impossible,” Harry said as Ron laughed. “No, it’s not,” said Hermione. “All we’d need would be some 
Polyjuice Potion.” 
“What’s that?” said Ron and Harry together. “Snape mentioned it in class a few weeks ago —” 
“D’you think we’ve got nothing better to do in Potions than lis-
ten to Snape?” muttered Ron. 
“It transforms you into somebody else. Think about it! We could 
change into three of the Slytheri ns. No one would know it was us. 
Malfoy would probably tell us an ything. He’s probably boasting 
about it in the Slytherin common r oom right now, if only we could 
hear him.” 
“This Polyjuice stuff sounds a bit dodgy to me,” said Ron, 
frowning. “What if we were stuck looking like three of the 
Slytherins forever?” 
“It wears off after a while,” said Hermione, waving her hand 
CHAPTER NINE 
 160  impatiently. “But getting hold of the recipe will be very difficult. 
Snape said it was in a book called Moste Potente Potions and it’s 
bound to be in the Restrict ed Section of the library.” 
There was only one way to get ou t a book from the Restricted 
Section: You needed a signed note of permission from a teacher. 
“Hard to see why we’d want the b ook, really,” said Ron, “if we 
weren’t going to try and make one of the potions.” 
“I think,” said Hermione, “that if we made it so und as though 
we were just interested in the theo ry, we might stand a chance. . . .” 
“Oh, come on, no teacher’s going to fall for that,” said Ron. 
“They’d have to be really thick. . . .”

 161  THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 
 
 
ince the disastrous episode of the pixies, Professor Lockhart 
had not brought live creatures to class. Instead, he read passages 
from his books to them, and so metimes reenacted some of the 
more dramatic bits. He usually picked Harry to help him with 
these reconstructions; so far, Harry had been forced to play a sim-
ple Transylvanian villa ger whom Lockhart ha d cured of a Babbling 
Curse, a yeti with a head cold, and a vampire who had been unable 
to eat anything except lettuce si nce Lockhart had dealt with him. 
Harry was hauled to the front of the class during their very next 
Defense Against the Dark Arts less on, this time acting a werewolf. 
If he hadn’t had a very good reason for keeping Lockhart in a good 
mood, he would have refused to do it. 
“Nice loud howl, Harry — exactl y — and then, if you’ll believe 
it, I pounced — like this — slammed him to the floor — thus — 
with one hand, I managed to hold him down — with my other, I

ing strength and performed th e immensely complex Homorphus 
Charm — he let out a piteous mo an — go on, Harry — higher 
than that — good — the fur vani shed — the fangs shrank — and 
he turned back into a man. Si mple, yet effective — and another 
village will remember me forever as the hero who delivered them 
from the monthly terror of werewolf attacks.” 
The bell rang and Lock hart got to his feet. 
“Homework — compose a poem ab out my defeat of the Wagga 
Wagga Werewolf! Signed copies of Magical Me to the author of the 
best one!” 
The class began to leave. Harry returned to the back of the 
room, where Ron and Herm ione were waiting. 
“Ready?” Harry muttered. “Wait till everyone’s gone,” said Hermione nervously. “All 
right . . .” 
She approached Lockhart’s desk, a piece of paper clutched tightly 
in her hand, Harry and Ron right behind her. 
“Er — Professor Lockhart?” Hermione stammered. “I wanted 
to — to get this book out of the library. Just for background read-
ing.” She held out the piece of pa per, her hand shaking slightly. 
“But the thing is, it’s in the Restri cted Section of the library, so I 
need a teacher to sign for it — I’m sure it would help me under-
stand what you say in Gadding with Ghouls about slow-acting ven-
oms —” 
“Ah, Gadding with Ghouls !” said Lockhart, taking the note from 
Hermione and smiling widely at her. “Possibly my very favorite book. You enjoyed it?” 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 163  “Oh, yes,” said Hermione eage rly. “So clever, the way you 
trapped that last one wi th the tea-strainer —” 
“Well, I’m sure no one will mind me giving the best student of 
the year a little extra help,” said Lockhart warmly, and he pulled out 
an enormous peacock quill. “Yes, ni ce, isn’t it?” he said, misreading 
the revolted look on Ron’s face. “I usually save it for book signings.” 
He scrawled an enormous loop y signature on the note and 
handed it back to Hermione. 
“So, Harry,” said Lockhart, while Hermione folded the note 
with fumbling fingers and slipped it into her bag. “Tomorrow’s the 
first Quidditch match of the season, I believe? Gryffindor against Slytherin, is it not? I hear you’re a useful player. I was a Seeker, too. 
I was asked to try for the National Squad, but preferred to dedicate 
my life to the eradication of the Da rk Forces. Still, if ever you feel 
the need for a little private training , don’t hesitate to ask. Always 
happy to pass on my expertise to less able players. . . .” 
Harry made an indistinct noise in his throat and then hurried 
off after Ron and Hermione. 
“ I d o n ’ t b e l i e v e i t , ” h e s a i d a s the three of them examined the 
signature on the note. “He didn’t even look at the book we wanted.” 
“That’s because he’s a brainless git, ” said Ron. “But who cares, 
we’ve got what we needed —” 
“He is not a brainless git,” said Hermio ne shrilly as they half ran 
toward the library. 
“Just because he said you were the best student of the year —” They dropped their voices as they entered the mu ffled stillness 
of the library. Madam Pince, the librarian, was a thin, irritable 
woman who looked like an underfed vulture. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 164  “Moste Potente Potions ?” she repeated suspiciously, trying to take 
the note from Hermione; but Hermione wouldn’t let go. 
“I was wondering if I could keep it,” she said breathlessly. 
“Oh, come on,” said Ron, wrenching it from her grasp and 
thrusting it at Madam Pince. “We’ll get you another autograph. 
Lockhart’ll sign anything if it stands still long enough.” 
Madam Pince held the note up to the light, as though deter-
mined to detect a forgery, but it passed the test. She stalked away 
between the lofty shel ves and returned seve ral minutes later carry-
ing a large and moldy-looking book. Hermione put it carefully into her bag and they left, trying not to walk too quickly or look too guilty. 
Five minutes later, they were barricaded in Moaning Myrtle’s 
out-of-order bathroom once agai n. Hermione had overridden Ron’s 
objections by pointing out that it was the last place anyone in their 
right minds would go, so they we re guaranteed some privacy. 
Moaning Myrtle was crying noisily in her stall, but they were ig-
noring her, and she them. 
Hermione opened Moste Potente Potions carefully, and the three 
of them bent over the damp-spott ed pages. It was clear from a 
glance why it belonged in the Rest ricted Section. Some of the po-
tions had effects almost too gruesome to think about, and there 
were some very unpleasant illustrations, which included a man 
who seemed to have been turned inside out and a witch sprouting 
several extra pa irs of arms ou t of her head. 
“Here it is,” said Hermione ex citedly as she found the page 
headed The Polyjuice Potion. It was decorated with drawings of 
people halfway through transforming into other people. Harry sin- 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 165  cerely hoped the artist had imagined the looks of intense pain on 
their faces. 
“This is the most complicated potion I’ve ever seen,” said 
Hermione as they scanned the re cipe. “Lacewing flies, leeches, 
fluxweed, and knotgrass,” she murmured, running her finger down 
the list of ingredients. “Well, th ey’re easy enough, they’re in the 
student store-cupboard, we can help ourselves. . . . Oooh, look, 
powdered horn of a bicorn — don’t know where we’re going to get 
that — shredded skin of a boomslang — that’ll be tricky, too — 
and of course a bit of whoever we want to change into.” 
“Excuse me?” said Ron sharply. “What d’you mean, a bit of 
whoever we’re changing into? I’m drinking nothing with Crabbe’s 
toenails in it —” 
Hermione continued as thou gh she hadn’t heard him. 
“We don’t have to worry about th at yet, though, because we add 
those bits last. . . .” 
Ron turned, speechless, to Harry, who had another worry. 
“D’you realize how mu ch we’re going to have to steal, Her-
mione? Shredded skin of a boomslang, that’s definitely not in the 
students’ cupboard. What’re we goin g to do, break into Snape’s pri-
vate stores? I don’t know if this is a good idea. . . .” 
Hermione shut the book with a snap. 
“Well, if you two are going to chicken out, fine,” she said. There 
were bright pink patches on her cheeks and her eyes were brighter 
than usual. “ I don ’t want to break rules, you know. I think threat-
ening Muggle-borns is far worse than brewing up a difficult po-
tion. But if you don’t want to find ou t if it’s Malfoy, I’ll go straight 
to Madam Pince now and hand the book back in —” 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 166  “I never thought I’d see the day when you’d be persuading us 
to break rules,” said Ron. “All ri ght, we’ll do it. But not toenails, 
okay?” 
“How long will it take to make, anyway?” said Harry as Her-
mione, looking happier, opened the book again. 
“Well, since the fluxweed has got to be picked at the full moon 
and the lacewings have got to be st ewed for twenty-one days . . . I’d 
say it’d be ready in about a month, if we can get all the ingredients.” 
“A month?” said Ron. “Malfoy could have attacked half the 
Muggle-borns in the school by then!” But Hermione’s eyes nar-
rowed dangerously again, and he added swiftly, “But it’s the best plan we’ve got, so full steam ahead, I say.” 
However, while Hermione was chec king that the coast was clear 
for them to leave the bathroom, Ron muttered to Harry, “It’ll be a 
lot less hassle if you can just knock Malfoy off his broom tomor-
row.” 
 
Harry woke early on Saturday morning and lay for a while think-
ing about the coming Quidditch ma tch. He was nervous, mainly at 
the thought of what Wood would say if Gryffindor lost, but also at 
the idea of facing a team mounted on the fa stest racing brooms 
gold could buy. He had never want ed to beat Slytherin so badly. 
After half an hour of lying there with his insides churning, he got 
up, dressed, and went down to brea kfast early, where he found the 
rest of the Gryffindor team huddl ed at the long, empty table, all 
looking uptight and not speaking much. 
As eleven o’clock approached, the whole school st arted to make 
its way down to the Quidditch stadiu m. It was a muggy sort of day 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 167  with a hint of thunder in the ai r. Ron and Hermione came hurry-
ing over to wish Harry good luck as he entered th e locker rooms. 
The team pulled on their scarlet Gryffindor robes, then sat down 
to listen to Wood’s us ual pre-match pep talk. 
“Slytherin has better brooms than us,” he began. “No point de-
nying it. But we’ve got better people on our brooms. We’ve trained 
harder than they have, we’ve been flying in all weathers —” (“Too 
true,” muttered George Weasley. “I haven’t been properly dry since 
August”) “— and we’re going to make them rue the day they let 
that little bit of slime, Malfoy, buy his way onto their team.” 
Chest heaving with emotion, Wood turned to Harry. “It’ll be down to you, Harry, to show them that a Seeker has to 
have something more than a rich fa ther. Get to that Snitch before 
Malfoy or die trying, Harry, becaus e we’ve got to win today, we’ve 
got to.” 
“So no pressure, Harry,” sa id Fred, winking at him. 
As they walked out onto the field, a roar of noise greeted them; 
mainly cheers, because Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were anxious to 
see Slytherin beaten, but the Slyt herins in the crowd made their 
boos and hisses heard, too. Madam Hooch, the Quidditch teacher, 
asked Flint and Wood to shake hands, which they did, giving each 
other threatening stares and gripping rather harder than was neces-
sary. 
“On my whistle,” said Madam Hooch. “Three . . . two . . . 
one . . .” 
With a roar from the crowd to speed them upward, the fourteen 
players rose toward the leaden sky. Harry flew higher than any of them, squinting arou nd for the Snitch. 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 168  “All right there, Scarhead?” ye lled Malfoy, shooting underneath 
him as though to show o ff the speed of his broom. 
Harry had no time to reply. At that very moment, a heavy black 
Bludger came pelting toward him; he avoided it so narrowly that 
he felt it ruffle hi s hair as it passed. 
“Close one, Harry!” said George, streaking past him with his 
club in his hand, ready to knock the Bludger back toward a Slyth-
erin. Harry saw George give the Bludger a powerful whack in the 
direction of Adrian Pucey, but the Bludger changed direction in 
midair and shot straig ht for Harry again. 
Harry dropped quickly to avoid it , and George managed to hit 
it hard toward Malfoy. Once ag ain, the Bludger swerved like a 
boomerang and shot at Harry’s head. 
Harry put on a bu rst of speed and zoomed toward the other end 
of the field. He could hear th e Bludger whistlin g along behind 
him. What was going on? Bludge rs never concentrated on one 
player like this; it was their job to try and unseat as many people as 
possible. . . . 
Fred Weasley was waiting for th e Bludger at the other end. 
Harry ducked as Fred swung at the Bludger with all his might; the 
Bludger was knocked off course. 
“Gotcha!” Fred yelled happily, bu t he was wrong; as though it 
was magnetically attracted to Harr y, the Bludger pelted after him 
once more and Harry was forced to fly off at full speed. 
It had started to rain; Harry felt heavy drops fall onto his face, 
splattering onto his glas ses. He didn ’t have a clue what was going 
on in the rest of the game unti l he heard Lee Jordan, who was com-
mentating, say, “Slytherin le ad, sixty points to zero —” 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 169  The Slytherins’ superior brooms were clearly doing their jobs, 
and meanwhile the mad Bludger wa s doing all it could to knock 
Harry out of the air. Fr ed and George were no w flying so close to 
him on either side that Harry coul d see nothing at all except their 
flailing arms and had no chance to look fo r the Snitch, let alone 
catch it. 
“Someone’s — tampered — with — this — Bludger —” Fred 
grunted, swinging his bat with all his might at it as it launched a 
new attack on Harry. 
“We need time out,” said George, trying to signal to Wood and 
stop the Bludger breaking Harr y’s nose at the same time. 
Wood had obviously got the mess age. Madam Hooch’s whistle 
rang out and Harry, Fred, and Geor ge dived for the ground, still 
trying to avoid the mad Bludger. 
“What’s going on?” said Wood as the Gryffindor team huddled 
together, while Slytherins in the crowd jeered. “We’re being flat-
tened. Fred, George, where were you when that Bludger stopped 
Angelina scoring?” 
“We were twenty feet above he r, stopping the other Bludger 
from murdering Harry, Oliver,” said George angrily. “Someone’s 
fixed it — it won’t leave Harry alone. It hasn’t gone for anyone else 
all game. The Slytherins must have done something to it.” 
“But the Bludgers have been lo cked in Madam Hooch’s office 
since our last practice, and there was nothing wrong with them then. . . .” said Wood, anxiously. 
Madam Hooch was walking toward them. Over her shoulder, 
Harry could see the Slytherin team jeering and pointing in his di-
rection. 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 170  “Listen,” said Harry as she came nearer and nearer, “with you 
two flying around me all the time the only way I’m going to catch 
the Snitch is if it flies up my sleeve. Go back to the rest of the team 
and let me deal wi th the rogue one.” 
“Don’t be thick,” said Fred. “It’ll take your head off.” Wood was looking from Ha rry to the Weasleys. 
“Oliver, this is insane,” said Alic ia Spinnet angrily. “You can’t let 
Harry deal with that thing on his own. Let’s ask for an inquiry —” 
“If we stop now, we’ll have to forfeit the match!” said Harry. 
“And we’re not losing to Slytherin just because of a crazy Bludger! 
Come on, Oliver, tell them to leave me alone!” 
“This is all your fault,” George said angrily to Wood. “ ‘Get the 
Snitch or die trying,’ what a stupid thing to tell him —” 
Madam Hooch had joined them. 
“Ready to resume pl ay?” she asked Wood. 
Wood looked at the determin ed look on Harry’s face. 
“All right,” he said. “Fred, George, you heard Harry — leave 
him alone and let him deal wi th the Bludger on his own.” 
The rain was falling more heavily now. On Madam Hooch’s 
whistle, Harry kicked hard into the air and heard the telltale whoosh 
of the Bludger behind him. Higher and higher Harry climbed; he 
looped and swooped, spiraled, zigza gged, and rolled. Slightly dizzy, 
he nevertheless kept his eyes wide open, rain was speckling his 
glasses and ran up his nostrils as he hung upside down, avoiding another fierce dive from the Bludger. He could hear laughter from 
the crowd; he knew he must lo ok very stupid, but the rogue 
Bludger was heavy and couldn’t change direction as quickly as 
Harry could; he began a kind of roller-coaster ride around the 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 171  edges of the stadium, squinting thro ugh the silver sheets of rain to 
the Gryffindor goal posts, where Adrian Pucey was trying to get 
past Wood — 
A whistling in Harry’s ear told him the Bludger had just missed 
him again; he turned right over and sped in the oppo site direction. 
“Training for the ballet, Potte r?” yelled Malfoy as Harry was 
forced to do a stupid kind of twir l in midair to dodge the Bludger, 
and he fled, the Bludger trailing a few feet behind him; and then, 
glaring back at Malfoy in hatred, he saw it — the Golden Snitch. It 
was hovering inches above Malfoy ’s left ear — and Malfoy, busy 
laughing at Harry, hadn’t seen it. 
For an agonizing moment, Harry hung in midair, not daring to 
speed toward Malfoy in case he looked up and saw the Snitch. 
WHAM. 
He had stayed still a second too long. The Bludger had hit 
him at last, smashed into his el bow, and Harry felt his arm break. 
Dimly, dazed by the searing pain in his arm, he slid sideways on 
his rain-drenched broom, one knee still crooked over it, his right 
arm dangling useless at his side — the Bludger came pelting back 
for a second attack, this time ai ming at his face — Harry swerved 
out of the way, one idea firmly lodged in his numb brain: get to 
Malfoy. 
Through a haze of rain and pain he dived for the shimmering, 
sneering face below him and saw it s eyes widen with fear: Malfoy 
thought Harry was attacking him. 
“What the —” he gasped, care ening out of Harry’s way. 
Harry took his remaining hand of f his broom and made a wild 
snatch; he felt his fing ers close on the cold Snitch but was now only 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 172  gripping the broom with his legs, and there was a yell from the 
crowd below as he head ed straight for the ground, trying hard not 
to pass out. 
With a splattering thud he hit the mud and rolled off his 
broom. His arm was hanging at a very strange angle; riddled 
with pain, he heard, as though from a distance, a good deal of 
whistling and shouting. He focused on the Snitch clutched in his good hand. 
“Aha,” he said vaguely. “We’ve won.” And he fainted. 
He came around, rain falling on hi s face, still lying on the field, 
with someone leaning over him. He saw a glitter of teeth. 
“Oh, no, not you,” he moaned. “ D o e s n ’ t k n o w w h a t h e ’ s s a y i n g , ” s a i d L o c k h a r t l o u d l y t o t h e 
anxious crowd of Gryffindors pr essing around them. “Not to 
worry, Harry. I’m abou t to fix your arm.” 
“No!” said Harry. “I’ll keep it like this, thanks. . . .” 
He tried to sit up, but the pain was terrible. He heard a familiar 
clicking noise nearby. 
“I don’t want a photo of th is, Colin,” he said loudly. 
“Lie back, Harry,” said Lockhart soothingly. “It’s a simple charm 
I’ve used countless times —” 
“Why can’t I just go to the ho spital wing?” sa id Harry through 
clenched teeth. 
“He should really, Professor,” said a muddy Wood, who couldn’t 
help grinning even thou gh his Seeker was injured. “Great capture, 
Harry, really spectacular, your best yet, I’d say —” 
Through the thicket of legs around him, Harry spotted Fred and 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 173  George Weasley, wrestling the rogue Bludger into a box. It was still 
putting up a terrific fight. 
“Stand back,” said Lockhart, wh o was rolling up his jade-green 
sleeves. 
“No — don’t —” said Harry weakly , but Lockhart was twirling 
his wand and a second later had dire cted it straight at Harry’s arm. 
A strange and unpleasant sensat ion started at Harry’s shoulder 
and spread all the way down to his fingertips. It felt as though his 
arm was being deflated. He didn’t dare look at what was happen-
ing. He had shut his eyes, his face turned away from his arm, but 
his worst fears were realized as the people above him gasped and Colin Creevey began clicking away madly. His arm didn’t hurt any-
more — nor did it feel remotely like an arm. 
“Ah,” said Lockhart. “Yes. Well, that can sometimes happen. But 
the point is, the bones are no longer broken. That’s the thing to 
bear in mind. So, Harry, just toddl e up to the hospital wing — ah, 
Mr. Weasley, Miss Granger, woul d you escort him? — and Madam 
Pomfrey will be able to — er — tidy you up a bit.” 
As Harry got to his feet, he felt strangely lopsided. Taking a deep 
breath he looked down at his righ t side. What he saw nearly made 
him pass out again. 
Poking out of the end of his robes was what looked like a thick, 
flesh-colored rubber glove. He trie d to move his fingers. Nothing 
happened. 
Lockhart hadn’t mended Harry’ s bones. He had removed them. 
 
Madam Pomfrey wasn’t at all pleased. 
“You should have come straight to me!” she raged, holding up 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 174  the sad, limp remainder of what, half an hour before, had been a 
working arm. “I can m end bones in a second — but growing them 
back —” 
“You will be able to, won’t you?” said Harry desperately. 
“I’ll be able to, certainly, but it will be painful,” said Madam 
Pomfrey grimly, throwing Harry a pair of pajamas. “You’ll have to 
stay the night. . . .” 
Hermione waited outside the curtain drawn around Harry’s bed 
while Ron helped him into his pajama s. It took a while to stuff the 
rubbery, boneless arm into a sleeve. 
“How can you stick up for Lock hart now, Hermione, eh?” Ron 
called through the curtain as he pulled Harry’s limp fingers through the cuff. “If Harry had wa nted deboning he would have 
asked.” 
“Anyone can make a mistake,” sa id Hermione. “And it doesn’t 
hurt anymore, does it, Harry?” 
“No,” said Harry, gettin g into bed. “But it doesn’t do anything 
else either.” 
As he swung himself onto the bed, his arm flapped pointlessly. 
Hermione and Madam Pomfrey came around the curtain. 
Madam Pomfrey was holding a larg e bottle of something labeled 
Skele -Gro. 
“You’re in for a rough night,” she said, pouring out a steaming 
beakerful and handing it to him. “Regrowing bones is a nasty busi-
ness.” 
So was taking the Skele-Gro. It burned Harry’s mouth and throat 
as it went down, making him coug h and splutter. Still tut-tutting 
about dangerous sports and inept teachers, Madam Pomfrey re- 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 175  treated, leaving Ron and Hermione to help Harry gulp down some 
water. 
“We won, though,” said Ron, a grin breaking across his face. 
“That was some catch you made. Malf oy’s face . . . he looked ready 
to kill. . . .” 
“I want to know how he fixed that Bludger,” said Hermione 
darkly. 
“We can add that to the list of questions we’ll ask him when 
we’ve taken the Polyjuice Potion,” said Harry, sinking back onto 
his pillows. “I hope it tastes better than this stuff. . . .” 
“If it’s got bits of Slytherins in it? You’ve got to be joking,” said 
Ron. 
The door of the hospital wing burs t open at that moment. Filthy 
and soaking wet, the rest of the Gr yffindor team ha d arrived to see 
Harry. 
“Unbelievable flying, Harry,” said George. “I’ve just seen Mar-
cus Flint yelling at Malfoy. Somet hing about having the Snitch on 
top of his head and not noticing. Malfoy didn’t seem too happy.” 
They had brought cakes, sweets, and bottles of pumpkin juice; 
they gathered around Harry’s bed and were just getting started on 
what promised to be a good party when Madam Pomfrey came 
storming over, shouting, “This boy needs rest, he’s got thirty-three 
bones to regrow! Out! OUT!” 
And Harry was left alone, with no thing to distract him from the 
stabbing pains in his limp arm. 
 
Hours and hours later, Harry woke quite suddenly in the pitch 
blackness and gave a small yelp of pain: His arm now felt full of 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 176  large splinters. For a second, he thought that was what had woken 
him. Then, with a thrill of horror, he realized that someone was 
sponging his forehe ad in the dark. 
“Get off!” he said loudly, and then, “ Dobby !” 
The house-elf’s goggling tennis ball eyes were peering at Harry 
through the darkness. A single tear was running down his long, pointed nose. 
“ H a r r y P o t t e r c a m e b a c k t o s c h o o l , ” h e w h i s p e r e d m i s e r a b l y . 
“Dobby warned and warned Harry Potter. Ah sir, why didn’t you 
heed Dobby? Why didn’t Harry Potter go back home when he 
missed the train?” 
Harry heaved himself up on his pillows and pushed Dobby’s 
sponge away. 
“What’re you doing here?” he said. “And how did you know I 
missed the train?” 
Dobby’s lip trembled and Harry was seized by a sudden suspi-
cion. 
“It was you!” he said slowly. “ You stopped the barri er from letting 
us through!” 
“Indeed yes, sir,” said Dobby, nodding his head vigorously, ears 
flapping. “Dobby hid and watched for Harry Potter and sealed the 
gateway and Dobby had to iron his hands afterward” — he showed 
Harry ten long, bandaged fingers — “but Dobby didn’t care, sir, 
for he thought Harry Potter was safe, and never did Dobby dream 
that Harry Potter would get to school another way!” 
He was rocking backward and fo rward, shaking his ugly head. 
“Dobby was so shocked when he heard Harry Potter was back at 
Hogwarts, he let his master’s di nner burn! Such a flogging Dobby 
never had, sir. . . .” 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 177  Harry slumped back onto his pillows. 
“You nearly got Ron and me expelle d,” he said fiercely. “You’d 
better get lost before my bone s come back, Dobby, or I might 
strangle you.” 
Dobby smiled weakly. 
“Dobby is used to death threats, sir. Dobby gets them five times 
a day at home.” 
He blew his nose on a corner of the filthy pillowcase he wore, 
looking so pathetic that Harry felt his anger ebb away in spite of 
himself. 
“Why d’you wear that thing, Dobby?” he asked curiously. 
“This, sir?” said Dobby, plucking at the pillowcase. “ ’Tis a mark 
of the house-elf’s enslavement, sir. Dobby can only be freed if his 
masters present him with clothes, si r. The family is careful not to 
pass Dobby even a sock, sir, for then he would be free to leave their house forever.” 
Dobby mopped his bulging eyes and said sudden ly, “Harry Pot-
ter must go home! Dobby thought his Bludger would be enough to 
make —” 
“Your Bludger?” said Harry, anger rising once more. “What 
d’you mean, your Bludger? You made that Bludger try and kill me?” 
“Not kill you, sir, never kill you!” said Dobby, shocked. “Dobby 
wants to save Harry Potter’s life! Better sent home, grievously in-
jured, than remain here, sir! Dobby only wanted Harry Potter hurt enough to be sent home!” 
“Oh, is that all?” said Harry angr ily. “I don’t suppose you’re go-
ing to tell me why you wanted me sent home in pieces?” 
“Ah, if Harry Potter only knew!” Dobby groaned, more tears 
dripping onto his ragged pillowcase. “If he knew what he means 
CHAPTER TEN 
 178  to us, to the lowly, the enslaved, we dregs of the magical world! 
Dobby remembers how it was when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-
Named was at the height of his po wers, sir! We house-elves were 
treated like vermin, sir! Of course , Dobby is still treated like that, 
sir,” he admitted, drying his face on the pillowcase. “But mostly, 
sir, life has improved for my ki nd since you triumphed over He-
Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Harry Potter survived, and the Dark Lord’s power was broken, and it was a new dawn, sir, and Harry 
Potter shone like a beacon of hope for those of us who thought the Dark days would never end, si r. . . . And now, at Hogwarts, 
terrible things are to happen, ar e perhaps happening already, and 
Dobby cannot let Harry Potter stay here now that history is to 
repeat itself, now that the Cham ber of Secrets is open once 
more —” 
Dobby froze, horrorstr uck, then grabbed Harry’s water jug from 
his bedside table and cracked it ov er his own head, toppling out of 
sight. A second later, he crawled back onto the bed, cross-eyed, muttering, “Bad Dobby, very bad Dobby . . .” 
“So there is a Chamber of Secrets?” Harry whispered. “And — 
did you say it’s been opened before ? Tell me, Dobby!” 
He seized the elf’s bony wrist as Dobby’s hand inched toward 
the water jug. “But I’m not Muggle-born — how can I be in dan-
ger from the Chamber?” 
“Ah, sir, ask no more, ask no more of poor Dobby,” stammered 
the elf, his eyes huge in the dark. “Dark deeds are planned in this place, but Harry Potter must no t be here when they happen — go 
home, Harry Potter, go home. Harry Potter must not meddle in 
this, sir, ’tis too dangerous —” 
“Who is it, Dobby?” Harry said, ke eping a firm hold on Dobby’s 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 179  wrist to stop him from hitting him self with the water jug again. 
“Who’s opened it? Who op ened it last time?” 
“Dobby can’t, sir, Dobby can’t, Dobby mustn’t tell!” squealed the 
elf. “Go home, Harry Potter, go home!” 
“I’m not going anywhere!” said Harry fiercely. “One of my best 
friends is Muggle-born; she’ll be fi rst in line if the Chamber really 
has been opened —” 
“Harry Potter risks his own life for his friends!” moaned Dobby 
in a kind of miserable ecstasy. “S o n o b l e ! S o v a l i a n t ! B u t h e m u s t 
save himself, he must, Ha rry Potter must not —” 
Dobby suddenly froze, his bat ears quivering. Harry heard it, 
too. There were footsteps coming down the passageway outside. 
“Dobby must go!” breathed the elf, terrified. There was a loud 
crack, and Harry’s fist was suddenly clenched on thin air. He 
slumped back into bed, his eyes on the dark doorwa y to th e hospi-
tal wing as the footsteps drew nearer. 
Next moment, Dumbledore was backing into the dormitory, 
wearing a long woolly dressing gown and a nightcap. He was carry-
ing one end of what looked like a statue. Professor McGonagall 
appeared a second later, carrying its feet. Together, they heaved it 
onto a bed. 
“Get Madam Pomfrey,” whispered Dumbledore, and Professor 
McGonagall hurried past the end of Harry’s bed out of sight. Harry 
lay quite still, pretending to be asleep. He heard urgent voices, and 
then Professor McGonagall swept ba ck into view, closely followed 
by Madam Pomfrey, who was pulling a cardigan on over her night-
dress. He heard a shar p intake of breath. 
“What happened?” Madam Pomfre y whispered to Dumbledore, 
bending over the statue on the bed. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 180  “Another attack,” said Dumbledore. “Minerva found him on the 
stairs.” 
“There was a bunch of grapes next to him,” said Professor Mc-
Gonagall. “We think he wa s trying to sneak up he re to visit Potter.” 
Harry’s stomach gave a horrible lurch. Slowly and carefully, he 
raised himself a few inches so he could look at th e statue on the 
bed. A ray of moonlight la y across its staring face. 
It was Colin Creevey. His eyes were wide and his hands were 
stuck up in front of him, holding his camera. 
“Petrified?” whispe red Madam Pomfrey. 
“Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “But I shudder to think . . . If 
Albus hadn’t been on the way downstairs fo r hot chocolate — who 
knows what might have —” 
The three of them stared dow n at Colin. Then Dumbledore 
leaned forward and wrenched the camera out of Colin’s rigid grip. 
“You don’t think he managed to get a picture of his attacker?” 
said Professor McGonagall eagerly. 
Dumbledore didn’t answer. He opened the back of the camera. 
“Good gracious!” said Madam Pomfrey. 
A jet of steam had hissed out of the camera. Harry, three beds 
away, caught the acrid smell of burnt plastic. 
“Melted,” said Madam Pomfrey wo nderingly. “All melted . . .” 
“What does this mean, Albus?” Professor McGonagall asked ur-
gently. 
“It means,” said Dumbledore, “that the Chamber of Secrets is 
indeed open again.” 
Madam Pomfrey clapped a hand to her mouth. Professor 
McGonagall stared at Dumbledore. 
 
THE ROGUE BLUDGER 
 181  “But, Albus . . . surely . . . who ?” 
“The question is not who,” said Dumbledore, his eyes on Colin. 
“The question is, how. . . .” 
And from what Harry could see of Professor McGonagall’s shad-
owy face, she didn’t understand this any better than he did.

arry woke up on Sunday mo rning to find the dormitory 
blazing with winter sunlig ht and his arm reboned but 
very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin’s bed, but it had been blocked from v i e w b y t h e h i g h c u r t a i n s H a r r y h a d

frey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bend-ing and stretching hi s arm and fingers. 
“All in order,” she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge left-
handed. “When you’ve finish ed eating, you may leave.” 
Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryf-
findor Tower, desperate to te ll Ron and Hermio ne about Colin 
and Dobby, but they weren’t there. Harry left to look for 
them, wondering where they could ha ve got to and feeling slightly 
hurt that they weren’t interested in whether he had his bones 
back or not. 
 H 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 183  As Harry passed the library, Percy Weasley strolled out of it, 
looking in far better spirits than last time they’d met. 
“Oh, hello, Harry,” he said. “Excell ent flying yesterday, really ex-
cellent. Gryffindor has just ta ken the lead for the House Cup — 
you earned fifty points!” 
“You haven’t seen Ron or Herm ione, have you?” said Harry. 
“No, I haven’t,” said Percy, his sm ile fading. “I hope Ron’s not in 
another girls’ toilet. . . .” 
Harry forced a laugh, watched Perc y walk out of sight, and then 
headed straight for Moaning Myr tle’s bathroom. He couldn’t see 
why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making 
sure that neither Filc h nor any prefects were around, he opened the 
door and heard their voices co ming from a locked stall. 
“It’s me,” he said, closing the door behind him. There was a 
clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw 
Hermione’s eye peering through the keyhole. 
“Harry !” she said. “You gave us such a fright — come in — 
how’s your arm?” 
“Fine,” said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was 
perched on the toilet, and a crac kling from under the rim told 
Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, water-proof fires was a specia lity of Hermione’s. 
“We’d’ve come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the 
Polyjuice Potion,” Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked 
the stall again. “We’ve decided this is the safest place to hide it.” 
Harry started to tell them abou t Colin, but Hermione inter-
rupted. 
“We already know — we heard Professor McGonagall telling 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 184  Professor Flitwick this morning. Th at’s why we decided we’d better 
get going —” 
“The sooner we get a confession out of Malfoy, the better,” 
snarled Ron. “D’you know what I think? He was in such a foul 
temper after the Quidditch match, he took it out on Colin.” 
“There’s something else,” said Harry, watching Hermione tear-
ing bundles of knotgrass and throwing them into the potion. 
“Dobby came to visit me in the middle of the night.” 
Ron and Hermione looked up, amazed. Harry told them every-
thing Dobby had told him — or hadn’t told him. Hermione and 
Ron listened with their mouths open. 
“The Chamber of Secrets has been opened before ?” Hermione 
said. 
“This settles it,” said Ron in a triumphant voice. “Lucius Malfoy 
must’ve opened the Chamber when he was at school here and now 
he’s told dear old Draco how to do it. It’s obvious. Wish Dobby’d 
told you what kind of monster’s in there, though. I want to know 
how come nobody’s noticed it sneaking around the school.” 
“Maybe it can make itself invisible,” sa id Hermione, prodding 
leeches to the bottom of the caul dron. “Or maybe it can disguise 
i t s e l f — p r e t e n d t o b e a s u i t o f a r m o r o r s o m e t h i n g — I ’ v e r e a d 
about Chameleon Ghouls —” 
“You read too much, Hermione,” said Ron, pouring dead 
lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry. 
“So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your 
arm. . . .” He shook his head. “You know what, Harry? If he doesn’t 
stop trying to save your life he’s going to kill you.” 
   
THE DUELING CLUB 
 185  The news that Colin Creevey had b een attacked and was now lying 
as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire 
school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with ru-
mor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the 
castle in tight-knit groups, as thou gh scared they would be attacked 
if they ventured forth alone. 
Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was 
distraught, but Harry felt that Fr ed and George were going the 
wrong way about cheering her up. Th ey were taking turns covering 
themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind 
statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told 
them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was 
having nightmares. 
Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talis-
mans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the 
school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green 
onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the 
other Gryffindor boys pointed out th at he was in no danger; he was 
a pureblood, and therefore un likely to be attacked. 
“They went for Filch first,” Neville said, his round face fearful. 
“And everyone knows I’m almost a Squib.” 
 
In the second week of Decemb er Professor McGonagall came 
around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at 
school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; 
they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very 
suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to wo rm a confession out of him. 
Unfortunately, the potion was on ly half finished. They still 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 186  needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only 
place they were going to get them was from Snape’s private stores. 
Harry privately felt he’d rather fa ce Slytherin’s legendary monster 
than let Snape catch hi m robbing his office. 
“What we need,” said Hermione br iskly as Thursday afternoon’s 
double Potions lesso n loomed nearer, “is a diversion. Then one of 
us can sneak into Sn ape’s office and take what we need.” 
Harry and Ron looked at her nervously. 
“I think I’d better do the actual stealing,” Hermione continued 
in a matter-of-fact tone. “You two will be expe lled if you get into 
any more trouble, and I’ve got a clean record. So all you need to 
do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes 
or so.” 
Harry smiled feebly. Deliberately causing mayhem in Snape’s 
Potions class was about as safe as poking a sleeping dragon in the 
eye. 
Potions lessons took place in on e of the large dungeons. Thurs-
day afternoon’s lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty caul-
drons stood steaming between the wooden de sks, on which stood 
brass scales and jars of ingred ients. Snape prow led through the 
fumes, making waspish remarks ab out the Gryffindors’ work while 
the Slytherins snigge red appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was 
Snape’s favorite student, kept flic king puffer-fish eyes at Ron and 
Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you co uld say “Unfair.” 
Harry’s Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his 
mind on more important things. He was waiting for Hermione’s signal, and he hardly listened as Sn ape paused to sneer at his watery 
 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 187  potion. When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, 
Hermione caught Harr y’s eye and nodded. 
Harry ducked swiftly down be hind his cauldr on, pulled one 
of Fred’s Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand. The fire work began to fizz and sputter. 
Knowing he had only se conds, Harry straightened up, took aim, 
and lobbed it into the air; it la nded right on target in Goyle’s 
cauldron. 
Goyle’s potion exploded, shower ing the whole class. People 
shrieked as splashes of the Swelli ng Solution hit them. Malfoy got 
a faceful and his nose began to swell like a balloon; Goyle blun-
dered around, his hands over his eyes, which had expanded to the size of a dinner plate — Snape was trying to restore calm and find 
out what had happened. Throug h the confusion, Harry saw Her-
mione slip quietly into Snape’s office. 
“Silence! SILENCE!” Snape ro ared. “Anyone who has been 
splashed, come here for a Deflating Draught — when I find out who did this —” 
Harry tried not to laugh as he watched Malfoy hurry forward, 
his head drooping with the weight of a nose like a small melon. As 
half the class lumbered up to Snape’s desk, some weighted down 
with arms like clubs, others unable to talk through gigantic puffed-
up lips, Harry saw Hermione slid e back into the dungeon, the 
front of her robes bulging. 
When everyone had taken a swig of antidote and the various 
swellings had subsided, Snape swept over to Goyle’s cauldron and 
scooped out the twisted black remains of the firework. There was a 
sudden hush. 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 188  “If I ever find out who threw th is,” Snape whispered, “I shall 
make sure that person is expelled.” 
Harry arranged his face into wh at he hoped was a puzzled ex-
pression. Snape was looking right at him, and the bell that rang ten 
minutes later could not ha ve been more welcome. 
“He knew it was me,” Harry told Ron and Hermione as they 
hurried back to Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. “I could tell.” 
Hermione threw the new ingredie nts into the cauldron and be-
gan to stir feverishly. 
“It’ll be ready in two we eks,” she said happily. 
“Snape can’t prove it was you,” said Ron reassuringly to Harry. 
“What can he do?” 
“Knowing Snape, something foul ,” said Harry as the potion 
frothed and bubbled. 
 
A week later, Harry, Ron, and Hermione were walking across the 
entrance hall when they saw a sm all knot of people gathered 
around the notice boar d, reading a piece of parchment that had 
just been pinned up. Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas beck-
oned them over, looking excited. 
“They’re starting a Dueling Club!” said Seamus. “First meeting 
tonight! I wouldn’t mind duelin g lessons; they might come in 
handy one of these days. . . .” 
“What, you reckon Slytherin’s monster can duel?” said Ron, but 
he, too, read the sign with interest. 
“Could be useful,” he said to Harry and Hermione as they went 
into dinner. “Shall we go?” 
Harry and Hermione were all for it, so at eight o’clock that 
 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 189  evening they hurried back to the Gr eat Hall. The long dining tables 
had vanished and a golden stage had appeared along one wall, lit by 
thousands of candles floating overhead. The ceiling was velvety 
black once more and most of the school seemed to be packed be-
neath it, all carrying their wands and looking excited. 
“I wonder who’ll be teaching us ?” said Hermione as they edged 
into the chattering crowd. “Someone told me Flitwick was a duel-ing champion when he was yo ung — maybe it’ll be him.” 
“As long as it’s not —” Harry be gan, but he ended on a groan: 
Gilderoy Lockhart was walking onto the stage, resplendent in robes 
of deep plum and accompanied by none other than Snape, wearing his usual black. 
Lockhart waved an arm for silence and called, “Gather round, 
gather round! Can everyone see me? Can you all hear me? Excel-
lent! 
“Now, Professor Dumbledore has gr anted me permission to start 
this little dueling club, to train yo u all in case you ever need to de-
fend yourselves as I myself have done on countless occasions — for 
full details, see my published works. 
“Let me introduce my assistant, Professor Snape,” said Lockhart, 
flashing a wide smile. “He tells me he knows a tiny little bit about 
dueling himself and has sportingly agreed to help me with a short 
demonstration before we begin. Now, I don’t want any of you 
youngsters to worry — you’ll still have your Potions master when 
I’m through with him, never fear!” 
“Wouldn’t it be good if they fi nished each other off?” Ron mut-
tered in Harry’s ear. 
Snape’s upper lip was curling. Harry wondered why Lockhart 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 190  was still smiling; if Snape had been looking at him like that he’d 
have been running as fast as he could in the opposite direction. 
Lockhart and Snape turned to face each other and bowed; at

Snape jerked his head irritably. Then they raised their wands like 
swords in front of them. 
“As you see, we are holding our wands in the accepted combat-
ive position,” Lockhart told the silent crowd. “On the count of 
three, we will cast our first spells . Neither of us wi ll be aiming to 
kill, of course.” 
“I wouldn’t bet on that,” Harry murmured, watching Snape bar-
ing his teeth. 
“One — two — three —” 
Both of them swung their wand s above their heads and pointed 
them at their opponent; Snape cried: “ Expelliarmus !” There was a 
dazzling flash of scarlet light and Lockhart was blasted off his feet: 
He flew backward off the stage, smashed into the wall, and slid 
down it to sprawl on the floor. 
Malfoy and some of the other Slytherins cheered. Hermione was 
dancing on tiptoes. “Do you thin k he’s all right?” she squealed 
through her fingers. 
“Who cares?” said Harry and Ron together. 
Lockhart was getting unsteadily to his feet. His hat had fallen off 
and his wavy hair was standing on end. 
“Well, there you have it!” he said, tottering back onto the plat-
form. “That was a Disarming Charm — as you see, I’ve lost my 
wand — ah, thank you, Miss Brown — yes, an excellent idea to 
show them that, Professor Snape, bu t if you don’t mind my saying 
 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 191  so, it was very obvious what you were about to do. If I had wanted 
to stop you it would have been only too easy — however, I felt it 
would be instructive to let them see . . .” 
Snape was looking murderous. Possibly Lockhart had noticed, 
because he said, “Enough demons trating! I’m going to come 
amongst you now and put you all into pairs. Professor Snape, if you’d like to help me —” 
They moved through the crowd, matching up partners. Lock-
hart teamed Neville with Justin Finch-Fletchley, but Snape reached 
Harry and Ron first. 
“Time to split up the dream team, I think,” he sneered. 
“Weasley, you can partner Finnigan. Potter —” 
Harry moved automatica lly toward Hermione. 
“I don’t think so,” said Snape, smiling coldly. “Mr. Malfoy, come 
over here. Let’s see what you make of the famous Potter. And you, 
Miss Granger — you can pa rtner Miss Bulstrode.” 
Malfoy strutted over, smirking. Behind him walked a Slytherin 
girl who reminded Harry of a picture he’d seen in Holidays with 
Hags. She was large and square and her heavy jaw jutted aggres-
sively. Hermione gave her a weak smile that she did not return. 
“Face your partners!” called Lockhart, back on the platform. 
“And bow!” 
Harry and Malfoy barely inclined their heads, not taking their 
eyes off each other. 
“Wands at the ready!” shouted Lockhart. “When I count to 
three, cast your charms to disarm your opponents — only to dis-
arm them — we don’t want any accidents — one . . . two . . . 
three —” 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 192  Harry swung his wand high, but Malfoy had already started on 
“two”: His spell hit Harry so hard he felt as though he’d been hit 
over the head with a saucepan. He stumbled, but everything still 
seemed to be working, and wast ing no more time, Harry pointed 
his wand straight at Malfoy and shouted, “ Rictusempra !” 
A jet of silver light hit Malfoy in the stomach and he doubled 
up, wheezing. 
“I said disarm only !” Lockhart shouted in alarm over the heads 
of the battling crowd, as Malfoy sank to his knees; Harry had hit 
him with a Tickling Charm, and he could barely move for laugh-
ing. Harry hung back, with a vagu e feeling it would be unsporting 
to bewitch Malfoy while he was on the floor, but this was a mis-
take; gasping for breath, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry’s knees, 
choked, “ Tarantallegra !” and the next second Harry’s legs began to 
jerk around out of his contro l in a kind of quickstep. 
“Stop! Stop!” screamed Lock hart, but Snape took charge. 
“Finite Incantatem !” he shouted; Harry’s feet stopped dancing, 
Malfoy stopped laughin g, and they were able to look up. 
A haze of greenish smoke was hovering over the scene. Both 
Neville and Justin were lying on the floor, panting; Ron was hold-
ing up an ashen-faced Seamus, apologizing for whatever his broken 
wand had done; but Hermione and Millicent Bulstrode were still 
moving; Millicent had Hermione in a headlock and Hermione was whimpering in pain; both their wands lay forgotten on the floor. 
Harry leapt forward and pulled Mill icent off. It was difficult: She 
was a lot bigger than he was. 
“Dear, dear,” said Lockhart, skit tering through the crowd, look-
ing at the aftermath of the duels. “Up you go, Macmillan. . . .

“I think I’d better teach you how to block unfriendly spells,” said 
Lockhart, standing flustered in the midst of the hall. He glanced at 
Snape, whose black eyes glinted, and looked quickly away. “Let’s 
have a volunteer pair — Longbo ttom and Finch-Fletchley, how 
about you —” 
“A bad idea, Professor Lockhart,” said Snape, gliding over like a 
large and malevolent bat. “Longbo ttom causes devastation with the 
simplest spells. We’ll be sending what ’s left of Finch-Fletchley up to 
the hospital wing in a matchbox.” Neville’s round, pink face went 
pinker. “How about Malfoy and Po tter?” said Snape with a twisted 
smile. 
“Excellent idea!” said Lockhart, gesturing Harry and Malfoy 
into the middle of the hall as the crowd backed away to give them 
room. 
“Now, Harry,” said Lockhart. “W hen Draco points his wand at 
you, you do this.” 
He raised his own wand, attemp ted a complicated sort of wig-
gling action, and dropped it. Snap e smirked as Lockhart quickly 
picked it up, saying, “Whoops — my wand is a little overex-
cited —” 
Snape moved closer to Malfoy, bent down, and whispered some-
thing in his ear. Malfoy smirked, too. Harry looked up nervously at 
Lockhart and said, “Professor, co uld you show me that blocking 
thing again?” 
“Scared?” muttered Malfoy, so that Lockhart couldn’t hear him. “You wish,” said Harry out of the corner of his mouth. 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 194  Lockhart cuffed Harry merrily on the shoulder. “Just do what I 
did, Harry!” 
“What, drop my wand?” 
But Lockhart wasn’t listening. 
“Three — two — one — go!” he shouted. 
Malfoy raised his wand quickly and bellowed, “ Serpensortia !” 
The end of his wand exploded. Harry watched, aghast, as a long 
black snake shot out of it, fell heavily onto the floor between them, and raised itself, ready to strike. There were screams as the crowd 
backed swiftly away, clearing the floor. 
“Don’t move, Potter,” said Snape lazily, clearly enjoying the sight 
of Harry standing motionless, eye to eye with the angry snake. “I’ll get rid of it. . . .” 
“Allow me!” shouted Lockhart. He brandish ed his wand at the 
snake and there was a loud bang; th e snake, instead of vanishing, 
flew ten feet into the air and fell back to the floor with a loud 
smack. Enraged, hissin g furiously, it slithe red straight toward 
Justin Finch-Fletchley and raised it self again, fangs exposed, poised 
to strike. 
Harry wasn’t sure what made him do it. He wasn’t even aware of 
deciding to do it. All he knew was that his legs were carrying him 
forward as though he was on cast ers and that he had shouted stu-
pidly at the snake, “Leave him alone!” And miraculously — inex-
plicably — the snake slumped to th e floor, docile as a thick, black 
garden hose, its eyes now on Harry. Harry felt the fear drain out of 
him. He knew the snake wouldn’t attack anyone now, though how 
he knew it, he couldn’t have explained. 
He looked up at Justin, grinning, expecting to see Justin looking 
 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 195  relieved, or puzzled, or even grateful — but certainly not angry 
and scared. 
“What do you think you’re playing at?” he shouted, and before 
Harry could say anything, Justin had turned and stormed out of the hall. 
Snape stepped forward, waved hi s wand, and the snake vanished 
in a small puff of black smoke. Sn ape, too, was looking at Harry in 
an unexpected way: It was a shre wd and calculatin g look, and Harry 
didn’t like it. He was also dimly aware of an ominous muttering all 
around the walls. Then he felt a tu gging on the back of his robes. 
“Come on,” said Ron’s voice in his ear. “Move — come on —” 
Ron steered him out of the ha ll, Hermione hurrying alongside 
them. As they went through the door s, the people on either side 
drew away as though they were frightened of catching something. 
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on, and neither Ron nor 
Hermione explained anything unti l they had dragged him all the 
way up to the empty Gryffindor common room. Then Ron pushed 
Harry into an armchair and said , “You’re a Parselmouth. Why 
didn’t you tell us?” 
“I’m a what?” said Harry. 
“A Parselmouth !” said Ron. “You can talk to snakes!” 
“I know,” said Harry. “I mean, that’s only the second time I’ve 
ever done it. I accidentally set a boa constrictor on my cousin Dud-
ley at the zoo once — long story — but it was telling me it had 
never seen Brazil and I sort of set it free without meaning to — 
that was before I knew I was a wizard —” 
“A boa constrictor told you it had never seen Brazil?” Ron re-
peated faintly.

 196  “So?” said Harry. “I bet loads of people here can do it.” 
“Oh, no they can’t,” said Ro n. “It’s not a very common gift. 
Harry, this is bad.” 
“What’s bad?” said Harry, starting to feel quite angry. “What’s 
wrong with everyone? Listen, if I ha dn’t told that snake not to at-

“Oh, that’s what you said to it?” “What d’you mean? You were there — you heard me —” 
“I heard you speaking Parseltongue ,” said Ron. “Snake language.

Harry gaped at him. “I spoke a different language? But — I didn’t realize — how can 
I speak a language without knowing I can speak it?” 
Ron shook his head. Both he and Hermione were looking as 
though someone had died. Harry coul dn’t see what was so terrible. 
“D’you want to tell me what’s wrong with stopping a massive 
snake biting off Justin’s head?” he said. “What does it matter how I 
did it as long as Just in doesn’t have to jo in the Headless Hunt?” 
“It matters,” said Hermione, speaking at last in a hushed voice, 
“because being able to talk to sn akes was what Salazar Slytherin was 
famous for. That’s why the symbol of Slytherin House is a serpent.” 
Harry’s mouth fell open. “Exactly,” said Ron. “And now th e whole school’s going to think 
you’re his great-great-great-gr eat-grandson or something —” 
“But I’m not,” said Harry, with a panic he couldn’t quite explain. 
“You’ll find that hard to prove, ” said Hermione. “He lived about 
a thousand years ago; for al l we know, you could be.”

 197     
Harry lay awake for hours that ni ght. Through a gap in the cur-
tains around his four-poster he watc hed snow starting to drift past 
the tower window and wondered . . . 
Could he be a descendant of Salazar Slytherin? He didn’t know 
anything about his father’s family, after all. The Dursleys had al-
ways forbidden questions abou t his wizarding relatives. 
Quietly, Harry tried to say something in Parseltongue. The 
words wouldn’t come. It seemed he had to be face-to-face with a 
snake to do it. 
But I’m in Gryffindor, Harry thought. The Sorting Hat wouldn’t 
have put me in here if I had Slytherin blood. . . . 
Ah, said a nasty little voice in his brain, but the Sorting Hat 
wanted to put you in Slytherin, don’t you remember ? 
Harry turned over. He ’d see Justin the ne xt day in Herbology 
and he’d explain that he’d been call ing the snake off, not egging it 
on, which (he thought angrily, pummeling his pillow) any fool 
should have realized. 
 
By next morning, however, the sn ow that had begun in the night 
had turned into a blizzard so thic k that the last Herbology lesson of 
the term was canceled: Professor Sprout wanted to fit socks and 
scarves on the Mandrake s, a tricky operation she would entrust to 
no one else, now that it was so important for the Mandrakes to 
grow quickly and revive Mrs. Norris and Colin Creevey. 
Harry fretted about this next to th e fire in the Gryffindor com-
mon room, while Ron and Hermione us ed their time off to play a 
game of wizard chess. 
“For heaven’s sake, Harry,” said Hermione, exasperated, as one 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 198  of Ron’s bishops wrestled her knight off his horse and dragged him 
off the board. “Go and find Justin if it’s so important to you.” 
So Harry got up and left throug h the portrait hole, wondering 
where Justin might be. 
The castle was darker than it usually was in daytime because of 
the thick, swirling gray snow at every window. Shivering, Harry 
walked past classrooms where lessons were taking place, catching 
snatches of what was happening within. Professor McGonagall was 
shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend 
into a badger. Resisting the urge to take a look, Harry walked on 
by, thinking that Justin might be using his free time to catch up on some work, and deciding to check the library first. 
A group of the Hufflepuffs who should have been in Herbology 
were indeed sitting at the back of the library, but they didn’t seem 
to be working. Between the long lines of high bookshelves, Harry 
could see that their heads were close together and they were hav-ing what looked like an absorbin g conversation. He couldn’t see 
whether Justin was among them. He was walking toward them 
when something of what they were saying met his ears, and he 
paused to listen, hidden in the Invisibility section. 
“So anyway,” a stout boy was saying, “I told Justin to hide up in 
our dormitory. I mean to say, if Potter’s marked him down as his 
next victim, it’s best if he keeps a low profile for a while. Of course, 
Justin’s been waiting for something like this to happ en ever since he 
let slip to Potter he was Mu ggle-born. Justin actually told him he’d 
been down for Eton. That’s not th e kind of thing you bandy about 
with Slytherin’s heir on the loose, is it?” 
“You definitely think it is Potter, then, Ernie?” said a girl with 
blonde pigtails anxiously. 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 199  “Hannah,” said the stout boy solemnly, “he’s a Parselmouth. 
Everyone knows that’s the mark of a Dark wizard. Have you ever 
heard of a decent one who could talk to snakes? They called 
Slytherin himself Serpent-tongue.” 
There was some heavy murmuring at this, and Ernie went on, 
“Remember what was written on the wall? Enemies of the Heir, Be-
ware. Potter had some sort of run-in with Filch. Next thing we know, 
Filch’s cat’s attacked. That first year, Creevey, was annoying Potter 
at the Quidditch match, taking pictures of him while he was lying 
in the mud. Next th ing we know — Creevey ’s been attacked.” 
“He always seems so nice, thou gh,” said Hannah uncertainly, 
“and, well, he’s the one who made You-Know-Who disappear. He 
can’t be all bad, can he?” 
Ernie lowered his voice mysterious ly, the Hufflepuffs bent closer, 
and Harry edged nearer so that he could catch Ernie’s words. 
“No one knows how he survived that attack by You-Know-Who. 
I m e a n t o s a y , h e w a s o n l y a b a b y w h e n i t h a p p e n e d . H e s h o u l d have been blasted into smithereens . Only a really powerful Dark 
wizard could have survived a curse like that.” He dropped his voice 
until it was barely more than a whisper, and said, “ That’s probably 
why You-Know-Who wanted to kill him in the first place. Didn’t 
want another Dark Lord competing with him. I wonder what other 
powers Potter’s been hiding?” 
Harry couldn’t take anymore. Cl earing his throat loudly, he 
stepped out from behind the booksh elves. If he hadn’t been feeling 
s o a n g r y , h e w o u l d h a v e f o u n d the sight that greeted him funny: 
Every one of the Hufflepuffs look ed as though they had been Pet-
rified by the sight of him, and th e color was draining out of Ernie’s 
face. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 200  “Hello,” said Harry. “I’m look ing for Justin Finch-Fletchley.” 
The Hufflepuffs’ worst fears had clearly been confirmed. They 
all looked fearfully at Ernie. 
“What do you want with him?” sa id Ernie in a qu avering voice. 
“I w a nted to te ll hi m wh a t r ea lly happened with that snake at 
the Dueling Club,” said Harry. 
Ernie bit his white lips and then, taking a deep breath, said, “We 
were all there. We saw what happened.” 
“Then you noticed that after I spoke to it, the snake backed 
off?” said Harry. 
“All I saw,” said Ernie stubborn ly, though he was trembling as 
he spoke, “was you speaking Pa rseltongue and chasing the snake 
toward Justin.” 
“I didn’t chase it at him!” Ha rry said, his voice shaking with 
anger. “It didn’t even touch him!” 
“It was a very near miss,” said Erni e. “And in case you’re getting 
ideas,” he added hastily, “I migh t tell you that you can trace my 
family back through nine generations of witches and warlocks and 
my blood’s as pure as anyone’s, so —” 
“I don’t care what sort of blood you’ve got!” said Harry fiercely. 
“Why would I want to attack Muggle-borns?” 
“I’ve heard you hate those Muggles you live with,” said Ernie 
swiftly. 
“It’s not possible to live with th e Dursleys and not hate them,” 
said Harry. “I’d like to see you try it.” 
He turned on his heel and stor med out of the library, earning 
himself a reproving glare from Madam Pince, who was polishing 
the gilded cover of a large spellbook. 
 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 201  Harry blundered up the corridor, ba rely noticing where he was 
going, he was in such a fury. The result was that he walked into 
something very large and solid, which knocked him backward onto 
the floor. 
“Oh, hello, Hagrid,” Harry said, looking up. Hagrid’s face was entirely hidd en by a woolly, snow-covered bal-
aclava, but it couldn’t possibly be anyone else, as he filled most of 
the corridor in his moleskin overcoat. A dead rooster was hanging from one of his massive, gloved hands. 
“All righ’, Harry?” he said, pull ing up the balaclava so he could 
speak. “Why aren’t yeh in class?” 
“Canceled,” said Harry, gettin g up. “What’re you doing in 
here?” 
Hagrid held up th e limp rooster. 
“Second one killed this term,” he explained. “It’s either foxes or 
a Blood-Suckin’ Bugbear, an’ I need the headmaster ’s permission 
ter put a charm around the hen coop.” 
He peered more closely at Harry from under his thick, snow-
flecked eyebrows. 
“Yeh sure yeh’re all righ’? Yeh look all hot an’ bothered —” 
Harry couldn’t bring himself to repeat what Ernie and the rest of 
the Hufflepuffs had been saying about him. 
“It’s nothing,” he said. “I’d bett er get going, Hagrid, it’s Trans-
figuration next and I’ve go t to pick up my books.” 
He walked off, his mind still full of what Ernie had said about 
him. 
“Justin’s been waiting for something like this to happen ever since he 
let slip to Potter he was Muggle-born. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 202  Harry stamped up the st airs and turned along another corridor, 
which was particularly dark; the to rches had been extinguished by 
a strong, icy draft that was blowing through a loose windowpane. 
He was halfway down the passage wh en he tripped headlong over 
something lying on the floor. 
He turned to squint at what he ’d fallen over and felt as though 
his stomach had dissolved. 
Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a 
look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceil-
ing. And that wasn’t all. Next to him was another figure, the 
strangest sight Harry had ever seen. 
It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and trans-
parent, but black and sm oky, floating immobile and horizontal, six 
inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an ex-pression of shock identical to Justin’s. 
Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart do-
ing a kind of drumroll against his r i b s . H e l o o k e d w i l d l y u p a n d 
down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as 
fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the 
muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side. 
He could run, and no one would ever know he had been there. 
But he couldn’t just leave them lying here. . . . He had to get help. . . . Would anyone believe he hadn’t had anything to do with 
this? 
As he stood there, panicking, a door right next to him opened 
with a bang. Peeves the Polt ergeist came shooting out. 
“Why, it’s potty wee Potter!” ca ckled Peeves, knocking Harry’s 
glasses askew as he bounced past him. “What’s Potter up to? Why’s 
Potter lurking —” 
THE DUELING CLUB 
 203  Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside 
down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick. He flipped the 
right way up, filled his lungs and, before Harry could stop him, screamed, “ATTACK! ATTACK! ANOTHER ATTACK! NO 
MORTAL OR GHOST IS SAFE! RUN FOR YOUR LIVES! 
ATTAAAACK!” 
Crash — crash — crash — door af ter door flew open along the 
corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being 
squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry 
found himself pinned against the wa ll as the teachers shouted for 
quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own 
class, one of whom still had blac k-and-white-striped hair. She used 
her wand to set off a loud bang, w hich restored silence, and ordered 
everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared 
somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene. 
“Caught in the act !” Ernie yelled, his face stark white, pointing 
his finger dramatic ally at Harry. 
“That will do, Macmillan!” said Professor McGonagall sharply. 
Peeves was bobbing overhead, no w grinning wickedly, surveying 
the scene; Peeves always loved ch aos. As the teac hers bent over 
Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, examining them, Peeves broke 
into song: 
 
“Oh, Potter, you rotter, oh, what have you done, 
You ’re killing off students, you think it’s good fun —” 
 
“That’s enough, Peeves!” bark ed Professor McGonagall, and 
Peeves zoomed away backward, wi th his tongue out at Harry. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 204  Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick 
and Professor Sinistra of the As tronomy department, but nobody 
seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, 
Professor McGonagall conjured a la rge fan out of thin air, which 
she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick 
up the stairs. This Ernie did, fann ing Nick along like a silent black 
hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone to-
gether. 
“This way, Potter,” she said. 
“Professor,” said Harry at on ce, “I swear I didn’t —” 
“This is out of my hands, Potter,” said Professor McGonagall 
curtly. 
They marched in silence around a corner and she stopped before 
a large and extremely ugly stone gargoyle. 
“Lemon drop!” she said. This wa s evidently a password, because 
the gargoyle sprang suddenly to li fe and hopped aside as the wall 
behind him split in two. Even fu ll of dread for what was coming, 
Harry couldn’t fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral stair-
case that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and 
Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud 
closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and 
higher, until at last, slightly di zzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door 
ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin. 
He knew now where he was bein g taken. This must be where 
Dumbledore lived.

hey stepped off the stone staircase at the top, and Professor 
McGonagall rapped on the door. It opened silently and they 
entered. Professor McGonagall told Harry to wait and left him 
there, alone. 
Harry looked around. One thing was certain: of all the teachers’ 
offices Harry had visited so far this year, Dumbledore’s was by far the most interesting. If he hadn’t been scared out of his wits that he 
was about to be thrown out of school, he would have been very 
pleased to have a chance to look around it. 
It was a large and beautiful circular room, full of funny little 
noises. A number of curious silv er instruments stood on spindle-
legged tables, whirring and emitting little puffs of smoke. The walls 
were covered with portraits of ol d headmasters and headmistresses, 
all of whom were snoozing gently in their frames. There was also an 
enormous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting on a shelf behind it, a 
shabby, tattered wi zard’s hat — the Sorting Hat. T 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 206  Harry hesitated. He cast a wary eye around the sleeping witches 
and wizards on the walls. Surely it couldn’t hurt if he took the hat 
down and tried it on again? Just to see . . . just to make sure it had 
put him in the right House — 
He walked quietly around the desk , lifted the hat from its shelf, 
and lowered it slowly onto his head. It was much too large and 
slipped down over his eyes, just as it had done the last time he’d put 
it on. Harry stared at the black in side of the hat, waiting. Then a 
small voice said in his ear, “Bee in your bonnet, Harry Potter?” 
“Er, yes,” Harry muttered. “Er — sorry to bother you — I 
wanted to ask —” 
“You’ve been wondering whether I put you in the right House,” 
said the hat smartly. “Yes . . . you we re particularly difficult to place. 
But I stand by what I said befo re” — Harry’s heart leapt — “you 
would have done well in Slytherin —” 
Harry’s stomach plummeted. He grabbed the point of the hat 
and pulled it off. It hung limply in his hand, grubby and faded. 
Harry pushed it back onto its shelf, feeling sick. 
“You’re wrong,” he said aloud to the still and silent hat. It didn’t 
move. Harry backed away, watching it. Then a strange, gagging 
noise behind him made him wheel around. 
He wasn’t alone after all. Standi ng on a golden perch behind the 
door was a decrepit-looking bird that resembled a half-plucked 
turkey. Harry stared at it and th e bird looked balefully back, mak-
ing its gagging noise again. Harry thou ght it looked very ill. Its eyes 
were dull and, even as Harry watc hed, a couple more feathers fell 
out of its tail. 
Harry was just thinking that all he needed was for Dumbledore’s 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 207  pet bird to die while he was alone in the office with it, when the bird 
burst into flames. 
Harry yelled in shock and backed away into the desk. He looked 
feverishly around in case there was a glass of water somewhere but 
couldn’t see one; the bird, meanwhile, had become a fireball; it gave 
one loud shriek and next second there was nothin g but a smolder-
ing pile of ash on the floor. 
The office door opened. Dumbledore came in, looking very 
somber. 
“Professor,” Harry gasped. “Your bird — I couldn’t do any-
thing — he just caught fire —” 
To Harry’s astonishme nt, Dumbledore smiled. 
“About time, too,” he said. “He’ s been looking dreadful for days; 
I’ve been telling him to get a move on.” 
He chuckled at the stunned look on Harry’s face. “Fawkes is a phoenix, Harry. Ph oenixes burst into flame when 
it is time for them to die and are reborn from the ashes. Watch 
him . . .” 
Harry looked down in time to see a tiny, wrinkled, newborn bird 
poke its head out of the ashes. It was quite as ugly as the old one. 
“It’s a shame you had to see him on a Burning Day,” said 
Dumbledore, seating himself behin d his desk. “He’s really very 
handsome most of the time, wond erful red and gold plumage. Fas-
cinating creatures, phoenixes. They can carry immensely heavy 
loads, their tears have healing powers, and they make highly faith-
ful pets.” 
In the shock of Fawkes catching fire, Harry had forgotten what 
he was there for, but it all came ba ck to him as Dumbledore settled 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 208  himself in the high chair behind th e desk and fixed Harry with his 
penetrating, light-blue stare. 
Before Dumbledore could speak another word, however, the 
door of the office flew open with an almighty bang and Hagrid 
burst in, a wild look in his eyes, his balaclava perched on top of his 
shaggy black head and the dead rooster still swinging from his 
hand. 
“It wasn’ Harry, Professor Dumbledor e!” said Hagrid urgently. “I 
was talkin’ ter him seconds before that kid was found, he never had 
time, sir —” 
Dumbledore tried to say something, but Hagrid went ranting 
on, waving the rooster around in his agitation, sending feathers 
everywhere. 
“— it can’t’ve bin him, I’ll swea r it in front o’ the Ministry o’ 
Magic if I have to —” 
“Hagrid, I —” 
“— yeh’ve got the wrong boy, sir, I know Harry never —” 
“Hagrid !” said Dumbledore loudly. “I do not think that Harry at-
tacked those people.” 
“Oh,” said Hagrid, the rooster fall ing limply at his side. “Right. 
I’ll wait outside then, Headmaster.” 
And he stomped out l ooking embarrassed. 
“You don’t think it was me, Pro fessor?” Harry repeated hopefully 
as Dumbledore brushed roos ter feathers off his desk. 
“No, Harry, I don’t,” said Du mbledore, though his face was 
somber again. “But I stil l want to talk to you.” 
Harry waited nervously while Dumbledore considered him, the 
tips of his long fingers together. 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 209  “I must ask you, Harry, whether there is anything you’d like to 
tell me,” he said gent ly. “Anything at all.” 
Harry didn’t know what to say. He thought of Malfoy shouting, 
“You’ll be next, Mudbloods!” and of the Polyjuic e Potion simmer-
ing away in Moaning Myrtle’s ba throom. Then he thought of the 
disembodied voice he had heard twice and remembered what Ron 
had said: “ Hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, even in 
the wizarding world. ” He thought, too, about what everyone was 
saying about him, and his growin g dread that he was somehow con-
nected with Salaza r Slytherin. . . . 
“No,” said Harry. “There isn’ t anything, Professor. . . .” 
 
The double attack on Justin an d Nearly Headless Nick turned 
what had hitherto been nervousness into real panic. Curiously, it 
was Nearly Headless Ni ck’s fate that seemed to worry people most. 
What could possibly do that to a gh ost? people aske d each other; 
what terrible power could harm someone who was already dead? 
There was almost a stampede to book seats on the Hogwarts Ex-
press so that students coul d go home for Christmas. 
“At this rate, we’ll be the only ones left ,” Ron told Harry and 
Hermione. “Us, Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle. What a jolly holiday 
it’s going to be.” 
Crabbe and Goyle, who always did whatever Malfoy did, had 
signed up to stay over the holidays, too. But Harry was glad that m o s t p e o p l e w e r e l e a v i n g . H e w a s tired of people skirting around 
him in the corridors, as though he were about to sprout fangs or 
spit poison; tired of al l the muttering, pointi ng, and hiss ing as he 
passed. 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 210  Fred and George, however, found all this very funny. They went 
out of their way to march ahea d of Harry down the corridors, 
shouting, “Make way for the Heir of Slytherin, seriously evil wiz-
ard coming through. . . .” 
Percy was deeply disapproving of this behavior. “It is not a laughing matter,” he said coldly. 
“Oh, get out of the way, Percy,” said Fred. “Harry ’s in a hurry.” 
“Yeah, he’s off to the Chamber of Secrets for a cup of tea with his 
fanged servant,” said George, chortling. 
Ginny didn’t find it amusing either. “Oh, don’t, ” she wailed every time Fr ed asked Harry loudly who 
he was planning to attack next, or when George pretended to ward 
Harry off with a large clove of garlic when they met. 
Harry didn’t mind; it made him feel better that Fred and 
George, at least, thought the idea of his being Slytherin’s heir was quite ludicrous. But their antics seemed to be aggravating Draco Malfoy, who looked increasingly sour each time he saw them at it. 
“It’s because he’s bursting to say it’s really him,” said Ron know-
ingly. “You know how he hates anyone beat ing him at anything, 
and you’re getting all the credit for his dirty work.” 
“Not for long,” said Hermione in a satisfied tone. “The Poly-
juice Potion’s nearly ready. We’ll be getting the truth out of him any 
day now.” 
 
At last the term ended, and a si lence deep as the snow on the 
grounds descended on the castle. Harry found it peaceful, rather 
than gloomy, and enjoyed the fa ct that he, Hermione, and the 
Weasleys had the run of Gryffindor Tower, which meant they could 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 211  play Exploding Snap loudly with out bothering anyone, and prac-
tice dueling in private. Fred, Ge orge, and Ginny had chosen to stay 
at school rather than visit Bill in Egypt with Mr. and Mrs. Weasley. 
Percy, who disapproved of what he termed their childish behavior, 
didn’t spend much time in the Gryffindor common room. He had 
already told them pompously that he was only staying over Christ-
mas because it was his duty as a prefect to support the teachers dur-ing this troubled time. 
Christmas morning dawned, cold and white. Harry and Ron, 
the only ones left in their dormi tory, were woken very early by 
Hermione, who burst in, fully dr essed and carrying presents for 
them both. 
“Wake up,” she said loudly, pullin g back the curtains at the win-
dow. 
“Hermione — you’re not supposed to be in here —” said Ron, 
shielding his eyes against the light. 
“Merry Christmas to you, too,” said Hermione, throwing him 
his present. “I’ve been up for nearly an hour, adding more lace-
wings to the potion. It’s ready.” 
Harry sat up, suddenly wide awake. 
“Are you sure?” 
“Positive,” said Hermione, shirting Scabbers the rat so that she 
could sit down on the end of Ron’s four-poster. “If we’re going to do it, I say it should be tonight.” 
At that moment, Hedwig swoope d into the room , carrying a 
very small package in her beak. 
“Hello,” said Harry happily as she landed on his bed. “Are you 
speaking to me again?” 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 212  She nibbled his ear in an affectionate sort of way, which was a far 
better present than the one th at she had brought him, which 
turned out to be from the Dursle ys. They had sent Harry a tooth-
pick and a note telling him to find out whether he’d be able to stay 
at Hogwarts for the summer vacation, too. 
The rest of Harry’s Christmas presents were far more satisfac-
tory. Hagrid had sent him a large tin of treacle toffee, which Harry 
decided to soften by the fire b efore eating; Ron had given him a 
book called Flying with the Cannons, a book of interesting facts 
about his favorite Quidditch team , and Hermione had bought him 
a luxury eagle-feather quill. Harry opened the last present to find a 
new, hand-knitted sweater from Mr s. Weasley and a large plum 
cake. He read her card with a fresh surge of guilt, thinking about Mr. Weasley’s car (which hadn’t been seen since its crash with the 
Whomping Willow), and the bout of rule-breaking he and Ron 
were planning next. 
 
No one, not even someone dreading taking Polyjuice Potion later, 
could fail to enjoy Christmas dinner at Hogwarts. 
The Great Hall looked magnificen t. Not only were there a dozen 
frost-covered Christmas trees and thick streamers of holly and mistletoe crisscrossing the ceiling, but enchanted snow was falling, 
warm and dry, from the ceiling. Dumbledore led them in a few of 
his favorite carols, Hagrid boom ing more and more loudly with 
every goblet of eggnog he cons umed. Percy, who hadn’t noticed 
that Fred had bewitched his prefect badge so that it now read “Pin-h e a d , ” k e p t a s k i n g t h e m a l l w h a t t h e y w e r e s n i g g e r i n g a t . H a r r y didn’t even care that Draco Malfoy was making loud, snide remarks 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 213  about his new sweater from the Slytherin table. With a bit of luck, 
Malfoy would be getting his come uppance in a fe w hours’ time. 
Harry and Ron had barely finished their third helpings of 
Christmas pudding when Hermione ushered them out of the hall 
to finalize their plans for the evening. 
“We still need a bit of the people you’re changing into,” said 
Hermione matter-of-factly, as though she were sending them to the supermarket for laundry detergent. “And obviously, it’ll be best if 
you can get something of Crabbe’s and Goyle’s; they’re Malfoy’s 
best friends, he’ll tell them anything. And we also need to make 
sure the real Crabbe and Goyle can’ t burst in on us while we’re in-
terrogating him. 
“I’ve got it all worked out,” she went on smoothly, ignoring 
Harry’s and Ron’s stupefied faces. She held up two plump choco-
late cakes. “I’ve filled these with a simple Sleeping Draught. All you 
h a v e t o d o i s m a k e s u r e C r a b b e and Goyle find them. You know 
how greedy they are, they’re bo und to eat them. Once they’re 
asleep, pull out a few of their hairs and hide them in a broom 
closet.” 
Harry and Ron looked incred ulously at each other. 
“Hermione, I don’t think —” 
“That could go seriously wrong —” 
But Hermione had a steely glint in her eye not unlike the one 
Professor McGonagall sometimes had. 
“The potion will be useless without Crabbe’s and Goyle’s hair,” 
she said sternly. “You do want to investigate Malfoy, don’t you?” 
“Oh, all right, all right,” said Harry. “But what about you? 
Whose hair are you ripping out?” 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 214  “I’ve already got mine!” said Hermione brightly, pulling a tiny 
bottle out of her pocket and showin g them the single hair inside it. 
“Remember Millicent Bulstrode wrestling with me at the Dueling 
Club? She left this on my robes when she was trying to strangle me! 
And she’s gone home for Christmas — so I’ll just have to tell the 
Slytherins I’ve deci ded to come back.” 
When Hermione had bustled off to check on the Polyjuice Po-
tion again, Ron turned to Har ry with a doom-la den expression. 
“Have you ever heard of a plan where so many things could go 
wrong?” 
 
But to Harry’s and Ron’s utter amazement, stage one of the opera-tion went just as smoothly as Hermione had said. They lurked in 
the deserted entrance hall after Ch ristmas tea, wait ing for Crabbe 
and Goyle who had remained alone at the Slytherin table, shovel-
ing down fourth helpings of trifle. Harry had perched the choco-late cakes on the end of the banisters. When they spotted Crabbe 
and Goyle coming out of the Great Hall, Harry and Ron hid 
quickly behind a suit of ar mor next to the front door. 
“How thick can you ge t?” Ron whispered ecstatically as Crabbe 
gleefully pointed out the cakes to Goyle and grabbed them. Grin-
ning stupidly, they stuffed the ca kes whole into their large mouths. 
For a moment, both of them chewed greedily, looks of triumph on 
their faces. Then, without the smallest change of expression, they both keeled over backward onto the floor. 
By far the hardest part was hiding them in the closet across the 
hall. Once they were safely stow ed among the buckets and mops, 
Harry yanked out a couple of the bristles th at covered Goyle’s fore- 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 215  head and Ron pulled out several of Crabbe’s hairs. They also stole 
their shoes, because their own we re far too small for Crabbe- and 
Goyle-size feet. Then, still stunned at what they had just done, they 
sprinted up to Moanin g Myrtle’s bathroom. 
They could hardly see for the thick black smoke issuing from the 
stall in which Hermione was stirring the cauldron. Pulling their robes 
up over their faces, Harry and Ron knocked softly on the door. 
“Hermione?” They heard the scrape of the lock and Hermione emerged, 
shiny-faced and looking anxiou s. Behind her they heard the gloop 
gloop of the bubbling, glutinous po tion. Three glass tumblers stood 
ready on the toilet seat. 
“Did you get them?” Herm ione asked breathlessly. 
Harry showed her Goyle’s hair. 
“Good. And I sneaked these spare robes out of the laundry,” 
Hermione said, holding up a sma ll sack. “You’ll need bigger sizes 
once you’re Crabbe and Goyle.” 
The three of them stared into th e cauldron. Close up, the potion 
looked like thick, dark mud, bubbling sluggishly. 
“I’m sure I’ve done everything right,” said Hermione, nervously 
rereading the splotched page of Moste Potente Potions. “It looks like 
the book says it should . . . once we’ve drunk it, we’ll have exactly 
an hour before we change back into ourselves.” 
“Now what?” Ron whispered. 
“We separate it into three glasses and add the hairs.” 
Hermione ladled large dollops of the potion into each of the 
glasses. Then, her hand trembling, she shook Millicent Bulstrode’s 
hair out of its bottle into the first glass. 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 216  The potion hissed loudly like a bo iling kettle and frothed madly. 
A second later, it had turn ed a sick sort of yellow. 
“Urgh — essence of Millicent Buls trode,” said Ron, eyeing it 
with loathing. “Bet it tastes disgusting.” 
“Add yours, then,” said Hermione. 
Harry dropped Goyle’s hair into the middle glass and Ron put 
Crabbe’s into the last one. Both glasses hissed and frothed: Goyle’s 
turned the khaki color of a booger , Crabbe’s a dark, murky brown. 
“Hang on,” said Harry as Ron and Hermione reached for their 
glasses. “We’d better not all drink them in here. . . . Once we turn into Crabbe and Goyle we won’t fit. And Millicent Bulstrode’s no pixie.” 
“Good thinking,” said Ron, unlock ing the door. “We’ll take sep-
arate stalls.” 
Careful not to spill a drop of his Polyjuice Potion, Harry slipped 
into the middle stall. 
“Ready?” he called. 
“Ready,” came Ron’s and Hermione’s voices. 
“One — two — three —” 
Pinching his nose, Harry drank the potion down in two large 
gulps. It tasted like overcooked cabbage. 
Immediately, his insides started writhing as though he’d just 
swallowed live snakes — doubled up, he wondered whether he was 
going to be sick — then a burnin g sensation spread rapidly from 
his stomach to the very ends of hi s fingers and toes — next, bring-
ing him gasping to all fours, came a horrible melting feeling, as the 
skin all over his body bubbled like hot wax — and before his eyes, 
his hands began to grow, the fingers thickened, the nails broadened, 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 217  the knuckles were bulging like bolts — his shoulders stretched 
painfully and a prickling on his fo rehead told him that hair was 
creeping down toward his eyebrows — his robes ripped as his chest 
expanded like a barrel bursting its hoops — his feet were agony in shoes four sizes too small — 
As suddenly as it had started, everything stopped. Harry lay 
facedown on the stone-cold floor, li stening to Myrtle gurgling mo-
rosely in the end toilet. With diff iculty, he kicked off his shoes and 
stood up. So this was what it felt like, being Goyle. His large hand 
trembling, he pulled off his old robes, which were hanging a foot 
above his ankles, pulled on the spare ones, and laced up Goyle’s 
boatlike shoes. He reached up to brush his hair out of his eyes and 
met only the short growth of wiry bristles, low on his forehead. Then he realized that his glasses were clouding his eyes because 
Goyle obviously didn’t need them — he took them off and called, 
“Are you two okay?” Goyle’s low ra sp of a voice issued from his 
mouth. 
“Yeah,” came the deep grunt of Crabbe from his right. 
Harry unlocked his door and stepped in front of the cracked 
mirror. Goyle stared back at hi m out of dull, deepset eyes. Harry 
scratched his ear. So did Goyle. 
Ron’s door opened. They stared at each other. Except that he 
looked pale and shocked, Ron wa s indistinguishable from Crabbe, 
from the pudding-bowl haircut to the long, gorilla arms. 
“This is unbelievable,” said Ron, approaching the mirror and 
prodding Crabbe’s flat nose. “ Unbelievable.” 
“We’d better get going,” said Ha rry, loosening the watch that 
was cutting into Goyle’s thick wrist. “We’ve still got to find out 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 218  where the Slytherin common room is. I only hope we can find 
someone to follow . . .” 
Ron, who had been gazing at Ha rry, said, “You don’t know how 
bizarre it is to see Goyle thinking. ” He banged on Hermione’s door. 
“C’mon, we need to go —” 
A high-pitched voice answered him. 
“I — I don’t think I’m going to co me after all. You go on with-
out me.” 
“Hermione, we know Millicent Bulstrode’s ugly, no one’s going 
to know it’s you —” 
“No — really — I don’t think I’ll come. You two hurry up, 
you’re wasting time —” 
Harry looked at Ron, bewildered. “That looks more like Goyle,” said Ron. “That’s how he looks 
every time a teacher asks him a question.” 
“Hermione, are you okay?” sa id Harry through the door. 
“Fine — I’m fine — go on —” 
Harry looked at his watch. Five of their precious sixty minutes 
had already passed. 
“We’ll meet you back he re, all right?” he said. 
Harry and Ron opened the door of the bathroom carefully, 
checked that the coast wa s clear, and set off. 
“Don’t swing your arms like that,” Harry muttered to Ron. 
“Eh?” “Crabbe holds them sort of stiff. . . .” 
“How’s this?” 
“Yeah, that’s better. . . .” They went down the marble stairc ase. All they ne eded now was 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 219  a Slytherin that they could follo w to the Slytherin common room, 
but there was no body around. 
“Any ideas?” muttered Harry. 
“The Slytherins always come up to breakfast from over there,” 
said Ron, nodding at the entrance to the dungeons. The words had 
barely left his mouth when a girl with long, curl y hair emerged 
from the entrance. 
“Excuse me,” said Ron, hurrying up to her. “We’ve forgotten the 
way to our common room.” 
“ I b e g y o u r p a r d o n ? ” s a i d t h e g i r l s t i f f l y . “ Our common room? 
I’m a Ravenclaw.” 
She walked away, looking suspiciously back at them. 
Harry and Ron hurried down the st one steps into the darkness, 
their footsteps echoing particularly loudly as Crabbe’s and Goyle’s huge feet hit the floor, feeling that this wasn’t going to be as easy as 
they had hoped. 
The labyrinthine passages were deserted. They walked deeper 
and deeper under the school, consta ntly checking their watches to 
see how much time they had left. After a quarter of an hour, just 
when they were getting desperat e, they heard a sudden movement 
ahead. 
“Ha!” said Ron excitedly. “T here’s one of them now!” 
The figure was emerging from a side room. As they hurried 
nearer, however, their hearts sank. It wasn’t a Slytherin, it was Percy. 
“What’re you doing down here?” said Ron in surprise. Percy looked affronted. 
“That,” he said stiffly, “is none of your business. It’s Crabbe, 
isn’t it?” 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 220  “Wh — oh, yeah,” said Ron. 
“Well, get off to your dormitories ,” said Percy sternly. “It’s not 
safe to go wandering around dark corridors these days.” 
“You are,” Ron pointed out. 
“I,” said Percy, drawing himself up, “am a prefect. Nothing’s 
about to attack me.” 
A voice suddenly echoed behind Harry and Ron. Draco Malfoy 
was strolling toward them, and for the first time in his life, Harry 
was pleased to see him. 
“There you are,” he drawled, looking at them. “Have you two 
been pigging out in th e Great Hall all this time? I’ve been looking 
for you; I want to show yo u something really funny.” 
Malfoy glanced with eringly at Percy. 
“And what’re you do ing down here, Weasley?” he sneered. 
Percy looked outraged. “You want to show a bit more re spect to a school prefect!” he 
said. “I don’t like your attitude!” 
Malfoy sneered and motioned fo r Harry and Ron to follow him. 
Harry almost said something apol ogetic to Percy but caught him-
self just in time. He and Ron hurried after Malfoy, who said as they 
turned into the next passage, “That Peter Weasley —” 
“Percy,” Ron correcte d him automatically. 
“Whatever,” said Malfoy. “I’ve noticed him sneaking around a 
lot lately. And I bet I know what he’s up to. He thinks he’s going to 
catch Slytherin’s heir single-handed.” 
He gave a short, derisive laug h. Harry and Ron exchanged ex-
cited looks. 
Malfoy paused by a stretch of bare, damp stone wall. 
 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 221  “What’s the new password ag ain?” he said to Harry. 
“Er —” said Harry. 
“Oh, yeah — pure-blood !” said Malfoy, not listening, and a 
stone door concealed in the wall slid open. Malfoy marched 
through it, and Harry an d Ron followed him. 
The Slytherin common room was a long, low underground 
room with rough stone walls and ceiling from which round, green-
ish lamps were hanging on chains . A fire was crackling under an 
elaborately carved mantelpiece ah ead of them, and several Slyth-
erins were silhouetted around it in high-backed chairs. 
“Wait here,” said Malfoy to Harry and Ron, motioning them to 
a pair of empty chairs set back fr om the fire. “I’ll go and get it — 
my father’s just sent it to me —” 
Wondering what Malfoy was going to show them, Harry and 
Ron sat down, doing their best to look at home. 
Malfoy came back a minute late r, holding what looked like a 
newspaper clipping. He thru st it under Ron’s nose. 
“That’ll give you a laugh,” he said. 
Harry saw Ron's eyes widen in shock. He read the clipping 
quickly, gave a very forced la ugh, and handed it to Harry. 
It had been clip ped out of the Daily Prophet, and it said: 
 
INQUIRY AT THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 
Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Ar-
tifacts Office, was today fi ned fifty Galleons for be-
witching a Muggle car. 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy, a go vernor of Hogwarts 
School of Witchcraft an d Wizardry, where the 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 222  enchanted car crashed earlie r this year, called today 
for Mr. Weasley’s resignation. 
“Weasley has brought the Ministry into disre-
pute,” Mr. Malfoy told our reporter. “He is clearly 
unfit to draw up our laws and his ridiculous Mug-
gle Protection Act should be scrapped immedi-
ately.” 
Mr. Weasley was unavailable for comment, al-
though his wife told reporters to clear off or she’d 
set the family ghoul on them. 
 
“Well?” said Malfoy impatientl y as Harry handed the clipping 
back to him. “Don’t yo u think it’s funny?” 
“Ha, ha,” said Harry bleakly. 
“Arthur Weasley loves Muggles so much he should snap his 
wand in half and go and join them,” said Malfoy scornfully. 
“You’d never know the Weasleys were purebloods, the way they 
behave.” 
Ron’s — or rather, Crabbe’s — face was contorted with fury. 
“What’s up with you, Cr abbe?” snapped Malfoy. 
“Stomachache,” Ron grunted. 
“Well, go up to the hospital wing and give all those Mudbloods 
a kick from me,” said Malfoy, sn ickering. “You know, I’m surprised 
the Daily Prophet hasn’t reported all these attacks yet,” he went on 
thoughtfully. “I suppose Dumbledor e’s trying to hush it all up. 
He’ll be sacked if it doesn’t stop soon. Father’s always said old 
Dumbledore’s the worst th ing that’s ever happen ed to this place. 
He loves Muggle-borns. A decent headmaster would never’ve let 
slime like that Creevey in.” 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 223  Malfoy started taking pictures with an imaginary camera and 
did a cruel but accurate impression of Colin: “ ‘Potter, can I have 
your picture, Potter? Can I have your autograph? Can I lick your 
shoes, please, Potter?’ ” 
He dropped his hands and lo oked at Harry and Ron. 
“What’s the matter with you two?” 
Far too late, Harry and Ron forc ed themselves to laugh, but 
Malfoy seemed satisfied; perhap s Crabbe and Goyle were always 
slow on the uptake. 
“Saint Potter, the Mudbloods’ fri end,” said Malfoy slowly. “He’s 
another one with no proper wizard feeling, or he wouldn’t go around with that jumped-up Granger Mudblood. And people 
think he’s Slytherin’s heir!” 
Harry and Ron waited with bated breath: Malfoy was surely sec-
onds away from te lling them it was him — but then — 
“I wish I knew who it is,” said Malfoy petulantly. “I could help 
them.” 
Ron’s jaw dropped so that Crabbe looked even more clueless 
than usual. Fortunately, Malfoy di dn’t notice, and Harry, thinking 
fast, said, “You must have some id ea who’s behind it all. . . .” 
“You know I haven’t, Goyle, how many times do I have to tell 
you?” snapped Malfoy. “And Father won’t tell me anything about 
the last time the Chamber was opened either. Of course, it was fifty 
years ago, so it was before his ti me, but he knows all about it, and 
he says that it was all kept quiet and it’ll look suspicious if I know 
too much about it. But I know one thing — last time the Cham-ber of Secrets was opened, a Mudblood died. So I bet it’s a matter 
of time before one of them’s killed this time. . . . I hope it’s 
Granger,” he said with relish. 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 224  Ron was clenching Crabbe’s gigantic fists. Feeling that it would 
be a bit of a giveaway if Ron punched Malfoy, Harry shot him a 
warning look and said, “D’you kn ow if the person who opened the 
Chamber last time was caught?” 
“Oh, yeah . . . whoever it wa s was expelled,” said Malfoy. 
“They’re probably still in Azkaban.” 
“Azkaban?” said Harry, puzzled. 
“Azkaban — the wizard prison, Goyle,” said Malfoy, looking at 
him in disbelief. “Honestly, if yo u were any slower, you’d be going 
backward.” 
He shifted restlessly in his chair and said, “Father says to keep 
my head down and let the Heir of Slytherin get on with it. He says 
the school needs ridding of all the Mudblood filth, but not to get 
mixed up in it. Of course, he’s go t a lot on his plate at the moment. 
You know the Ministry of Magic raided ou r manor last week?” 
Harry tried to force Goyle’s dull face into a look of concern. 
“Yeah . . .” said Malfoy. “Luckily, they didn’t find much. Father’s 
got some very valuable Dark Arts stuff. But luckily, we’ve got our 
own secret chamber under th e drawing-room floor —” 
“Ho!” said Ron. 
Malfoy looked at him. So did Ha rry. Ron blushed. Even his hair 
was turning red. His nose was also slowly lengthening — their 
hour was up, Ron was turning back into himself, and from the look 
of horror he was suddenly givi ng Harry, he must be, too. 
They both jumped to their feet. 
“Medicine for my stomach,” Ron grunted, and without further 
ado they sprinted the length of the Slytherin common room, 
hurled themselves at the stone wall, and dashed up the passage, hoping against hope that Malfoy hadn’t noticed anything. Harry 
THE POLYJUICE POTION 
 225  could feel his feet slipping around in Goyle’s huge shoes and had to 
hoist up his robes as he shrank; th ey crashed up the steps into the 
dark entrance hall, which was full of a muffled pounding coming 
from the closet where they’d locked Crabbe and Goyle. Leaving 
their shoes outside the closet door, they sprinted in their socks up 
the marble staircase toward Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. 
“Well, it wasn’t a complete wast e of time,” Ron panted, closing 
the bathroom door behind them. “I know we still haven’t found 
out who’s doing the attacks, but I’m going to write to Dad tomor-row and tell him to check under the Malfoys’ drawing room.” 
Harry checked his face in the cr acked mirror. He was back to 
normal. He put his glasses on as Ron hammered on the door of 
Hermione’s stall. 
“Hermione, come out, we’ve got loads to tell you —” “Go away!” Hermione squeaked. 
Harry and Ron looked at each other. “What’s the matter?” said Ron. “You must be back to normal by 
now, we are —” 
But Moaning Myrtle glided su ddenly through the stall door. 
Harry had never seen he r looking so happy. 
“Ooooooh, wait till you see,” she said. “It’s awful —” 
They heard the lock slide back and Hermione emerged, sob-
bing, her robes pulled up over her head. 
“What’s up?” said Ron uncertai nly. “Have you still got Milli-
cent’s nose or something?” 
Hermione let her robes fall an d Ron backed into the sink. 
Her face was covered in black fu r. Her eyes had turned yellow 
and there were long, pointed ea rs poking through her hair. 
“It was a c-cat hair!” she ho wled. “M-Millicent Bulstrode 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 226  m-must have a cat! And the p-poti on isn’t supposed to be used for 
animal transformations!” 
“Uh-oh,” said Ron. 
“You’ll be teased something dreadful, ” said Myrtle happily. 
“It’s okay, Hermione,” said Harry quickly. “We’ll take you up to 
the hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey never asks too many ques-tions. . . .” 
It took a long time to persua de Hermione to leave the bath-
room. Moaning Myrtle sped them on their way with a hearty guf-
faw. “Wait till everyone finds out you’ve got a tail!”

ermione remained in the hospit al wing for several weeks. 
There was a flurry of rumo r about her disappearance 
when the rest of the school arrived back fr om their Christmas hol-
idays, because of course everyone thought that sh e had been at-
tacked. So many students filed pa st the hospital wing trying to 
catch a glimpse of her that Mada m Pomfrey took ou t her curtains 
again and placed them around He rmione’s bed, to spare her the 
shame of being seen with a furry face. 
Harry and Ron went to visit he r every evening. When the new 
term started, they brought her each day’s homework. 
“If I’d sprouted whiskers, I’d take a break from work,” said Ron, 
tipping a stack of b ooks onto Hermione’s bedside table one 
evening. 
“Don’t be silly, Ron, I’ve got to keep up,” said Hermione briskly. 
Her spirits were greatly improved by the fact that all the hair had 
 H 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 228  gone from her face and her eyes were turning slowly back to brown. 
“I don’t suppose you’ve got any new leads?” she added in a whisper, 
so that Madam Pomfrey couldn’t hear her. 
“Nothing,” said Harry gloomily. 
“I was so sure it was Malfoy,” said Ron, for about the hundredth 
time. 
“What’s that?” asked Harry, pointi ng to something gold sticking 
out from under Hermione’s pillow. 
“Just a get well card,” said Hermio ne hastily, trying to poke it 
out of sight, but Ron was too qu ick for her. He pulled it out, 
flicked it open, and read aloud: 
“To Miss Granger, wishing you a speedy recovery, from your con-
cerned teacher, Professor Gilderoy Lockhart, Order of Merlin, Third 
Class, Honorary Member of the Dark Force Defense League, and five-time winner of Witch Weekly’s Most-Charming-Smile Award. ” 
Ron looked up at Hermione, disgusted. 
“You sleep with this under your pillow ?” 
But Hermione was spared answering by Madam Pomfrey sweep-
ing over with her even ing dose of medicine. 
“Is Lockhart the smarmiest bloke you’ve ever met, or what?” 
Ron said to Harry as they left the infirmary and started up the 
stairs toward Gryffindor Tower. Snape had given them so much 
homework, Harry thought he was like ly to be in the sixth year be-
fore he finished it. Ron was just saying he wished he had asked 
Hermione how many rat tails you we re supposed to add to a Hair-
Raising Potion when an angry outburst from the floor above 
reached their ears. 
“That’s Filch,” Harry muttered as they hurried up the stairs and 
paused, out of sigh t, listening hard. 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 229  “You don’t think someone else’s been attacked?” said Ron 
tensely. 
They stood still, their heads inclin ed toward Filch’s voice, which 
sounded quite hysterical. 
“— even more work for me! Mopping all night, like I haven’t got 
enough to do! No, this is the final straw, I’m going to Dumbledore —” 
His footsteps receded along the out-of-sight corridor and they 
heard a distan t door slam. 
They poked their heads around the corner. Filch had clearly 
been manning his usual lookout post : They were once again on the 
spot where Mrs. Norris had been attacked. They sa w at a glance 
what Filch had been shouting about. A gr eat flood of water 
stretched over half the corridor, and it looked as though it was still 
seeping from under the door of Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. Now 
that Filch had stopped shouting, they could hear Myrtle’s wails echoing off the bathroom walls. 
“Now what’s up with her?” said Ron. 
“Let’s go and see,” sa id Harry, and holding th eir robes over their 
ankles they stepped through the great wash of water to the door 
bearing its out of order sign, ignored it as always, and entered. 
Moaning Myrtle was crying, if po ssible, louder and harder than 
ever before. She seemed to be hiding down her usual toilet. It was 
dark in the bathroom because the candles had been extinguished in 
the great rush of water that had left both walls and floor soaking wet. 
“What’s up, Myrtle?” said Harry. 
“Who’s that?” glugged Myrtle mi serably. “Come to throw some-
thing else at me?” 
Harry waded across to her stall and said, “Why would I throw 
something at you?” 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 230  “Don’t ask me,” Myrtle shouted, emerging with a wave of yet 
more water, which splashed onto the already sopping floor. “Here I 
am, minding my own business, and someone thinks it’s funny to 
throw a book at me. . . .” 
“But it can’t hurt you if someone throws something at you,” 
said Harry, reasonably. “I mean, it’d just go right through you, 
wouldn’t it?” 
He had said the wrong thing. Myrtle puffed herself up and 
shrieked, “Let’s all throw books at Myrtle, because she can’t feel it! 
Ten points if you can get it through her stomach! Fifty points if it 
goes through her head! Well, ha, ha, ha! What a lovely game, I don’t 
think!” 
“Who threw it at you, anyway?” asked Harry. “I don’t know. . . . I was just si tting in the U-bend, thinking 
about death, and it fell right thro ugh the top of my head,” said 
Myrtle, glaring at them. “It’s over there, it go t washed out. . . .” 
Harry and Ron looked under the sink where Myrtle was point-
ing. A small, thin book lay there. It had a shabby black cover and 
was as wet as everything else in the bathroom. Harry stepped for-
ward to pick it up, but Ron suddenly flung out an arm to hold 
him back. 
“What?” said Harry. 
“Are you crazy?” said Ron. “It could be dangerous.” 
“Dangerous ?” said Harry, laughing. “C ome off it, how could it be 
dangerous?” 
“You’d be surprised,” said Ron, who was looking apprehensively 
at the book. “Some of the book s the Ministry’s confiscated — 
Dad’s told me — there was one that burned your ey es out. And 
 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 231  everyone who read Sonnets of a Sorcerer spoke in limericks for the 
rest of their lives. And some old witch in Bath had a book that you 
could never stop reading ! You just had to wander around with your 
nose in it, trying to do ev erything one-handed. And —” 
“All right, I’ve got the point,” said Harry. 
The little book lay on the fl oor, nondescript and soggy. 
“Well, we won’t find out unless we look at it,” he said, and he 
ducked around Ron and pick ed it up off the floor. 
Harry saw at once that it was a di ary, and the faded year on the 
cover told him it was fifty years ol d. He opened it eagerly. On the 
first page he could just make out the name “T. M. Riddle” in smudged ink. 
“Hang on,” said Ron, who had approached cautiously and was 
looking over Harry’s shoulder. “I know that name. . . . T. M. Rid-
dle got an award for special services to the school fifty years ago.” 
“How on earth d’you know that?” said Harry in amazement. “Because Filch made me polish his shield about fifty times in de-
tention,” said Ron resentfully. “T hat was the one I burped slugs all 
over. If you’d wiped slime off a na me for an hour, you’d remember 
it, too.” 
Harry peeled the wet pages apart. They were comp letely blank. 
There wasn’t the faintest trace of writing on any of them, not even 
Auntie Mabel’s birthday, or dentist, half-past three. 
“He never wrote in it,” sa id Harry, disappointed. 
“I wonder why someone wanted to flush it away?” said Ron cu-
riously. 
Harry turned to the back cover of the book and saw the printed 
name of a variety store on Vauxhall Road, London. 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 232  “He must’ve been Muggle-born,” said Harry thoughtfully. “To 
have bought a diary from Vauxhall Road. . . .” 
“Well, it’s not much use to yo u,” said Ron. He dropped his 
voice. “Fifty points if you can get it through Myrtle’s nose.” 
Harry, however, pocketed it. 
 
Hermione left the hospital wing, de-whiskered, tail-less, and fur-
free, at the beginning of February . On her first evening back in 
Gryffindor Tower, Harry showed her T. M. Riddle’s diary and told 
her the story of how they had found it. 
“Oooh, it might have hidden powe rs,” said Hermione enthusi-
astically, taking the diary and looking at it closely. 
“If it has, it’s hiding them very we ll,” said Ron. “Maybe it’s shy. 
I don’t know why you don ’t chuck it, Harry.” 
“I wish I knew why someone did try to chuck it,” said Harry. “I 
wouldn’t mind knowing how Riddle got an award for special ser-
vices to Hogwarts either.” 
“Could’ve been anything,” said Ron. “Maybe he got thirty 
O.W.L.s or saved a teacher from the giant squid. Maybe he mur-
dered Myrtle; that wo uld’ve done everyone a favor. . . .” 
But Harry could tell from the arre sted look on Hermione’s face 
that she was thinking what he was thinking. 
“What?” said Ron, looking from one to the other. “Well, the Chamber of Secrets wa s opened fifty years ago, wasn’t 
it?” he said. “That’s what Malfoy said.” 
“Yeah . . .” said Ron slowly. “And this diary is fifty years old,” said Hermione, tapping it ex-
citedly. 
 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 233  “So?” 
“Oh, Ron, wake up,” snapped Hermione. “We know the person 
who opened the Chamber la st time was expelled fifty years ago. We 
know T. M. Riddle got an award fo r special services to the school 
fifty years ago. Well, what if Riddle got his special award for catch-
ing the Heir of Slytherin ? His diary would probably tell us every-
thing — where the Chamber is, and how to open it, and what sort 
of creature lives in it — the person who’s behind the attacks this 
time wouldn’t want that lying around, would they?” 
“That’s a brilliant theory, Hermione,” said Ron, “with just one 
tiny little flaw. There’s nothing written in his diary. ” 
But Hermione was pulling he r wand out of her bag. 
“It might be invisible ink!” she whispered. 
She tapped the diary th ree times and said, “ Aparecium !” 
Nothing happened. Undaunted, Hermione shoved her hand back 
into her bag and pulled ou t what appeared to be a bright red eraser. 
“It’s a Revealer, I got it in Diagon Alley,” she said. 
She rubbed hard on January first. Nothing happened. 
“I’m telling you, there’s nothing to find in there,” said Ron. 
“Riddle just got a diary for Chri stmas and couldn’t be bothered 
filling it in.” 
 
Harry couldn’t explain, even to himself, why he didn’t just throw Riddle’s diary away. The fact was that even though he knew the di-
ary was blank, he kept absentmindedly picking it up and turn-
ing the pages, as though it were a story he wanted to finish. And 
while Harry was sure he had never heard the name T. M. Riddle 
before, it still seemed to mean some thing to him, almost as though 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 234  Riddle was a friend he’d had when he was very small, and had half-
forgotten. But this was absurd. He’d never had friends before 
Hogwarts, Dudley had made sure of that. 
Nevertheless, Harry was determined to find out more about 
Riddle, so next day at break, he he aded for the trophy room to ex-
amine Riddle’s special award, accompanied by an interested Her-
mione and a thoroughly unconvin ced Ron, who to ld them he’d 
seen enough of the trophy room to last him a lifetime. 
Riddle’s burnished gold shield wa s tucked away in a corner cab-
inet. It didn’t carry details of wh y it had been given to him (“Good 
thing, too, or it’d be even bigger and I’d still be polishing it,” said 
Ron). However, they did find Riddle’s name on an old Medal for 
Magical Merit, and on a list of old Head Boys. 
“He sounds like Percy,” said Ron, wrinkling his nose in disgust. 
“Prefect, Head Boy . . . prob ably top of every class —” 
“You say that like it’s a bad th ing,” said Hermione in a slightly 
hurt voice. 
 
The sun had now begun to shine weak ly on Hogwarts again. Inside 
the castle, the mood ha d grown more hopeful. There had been no 
more attacks since those on Justin and Nearly Headless Nick, and 
Madam Pomfrey was pleased to re port that the Mandrakes were 
becoming moody and secretive, mean ing that they were fast leav-
ing childhood. 
“The moment their acne clears up, they’ll be ready for repotting 
again,” Harry heard her telling Filch kindly one afternoon. “And 
after that, it won’t be long until we’re cutting them up and stewing them. You’ll have Mrs. Norris back in no time.” 
 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 235  Perhaps the Heir of Slytherin had lost his or her nerve, thought 
Harry. It must be ge tting riskier and riskie r to open the Chamber 
of Secrets, with the school so alert and suspicious. Perhaps the 
monster, whatever it was, was ev en now settling itself down to hi-
bernate for another fifty years. . . . 
Ernie Macmillan of Hufflepuff didn ’t take this cheerful view. He 
was still convinced that Harry wa s the guilty one, that he had 
“given himself away” at the Duelin g Club. Peeves wasn’t helping 
matters; he kept popping up in the crowded corridors singing “Oh, 
Potter, you rotter . . .” now wi th a dance routine to match. 
Gilderoy Lockhart seemed to think he himself had made the at-
tacks stop. Harry overheard him te lling Professor McGonagall so 
while the Gryffindors were lining up for Transfiguration. 
“I don’t think there’ll be any mo re trouble, Minerva,” he said, 
tapping his nose knowingly and winking. “I think the Chamber has been locked for good this time. The culprit must have known it was only a matter of time before I caught him. Ra ther sensible to 
stop now, before I ca me down hard on him. 
“You know, what the school ne eds now is a morale-booster. 
Wash away the memories of last term! I won’t say any more just 
now, but I think I know just the thing. . . .” 
He tapped his nose ag ain and strode off. 
Lockhart’s idea of a morale-boos ter became clear at breakfast 
time on February fourteenth. Har ry hadn’t had much sleep because 
of a late-running Quidditch practi ce the night before, and he hur-
ried down to the Great Hall, slightly late. He thought, for a mo-
ment, that he’d walked through the wrong doors. 
The walls were all covered with la rge, lurid pink flowers. Worse 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 236  still, heart-shaped confetti was fa lling from the pale blue ceiling. 
Harry went over to the Gryffindor table, where Ron was sitting 
looking sickened, and Hermione s eemed to have been overcome 
with giggles. 
“What’s going on?” Harry asked them, sitt ing down and wiping 
confetti off his bacon. 
Ron pointed to the teachers’ table, apparently too disgusted to 
speak. Lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes to match the decora-tions, was waving for silence. The teachers on either side of him 
were looking stony-faced. From where he sat, Harry could see a 
muscle going in Professor McGo nagall’s cheek. Snape looked as 
though someone had just fed him a large beaker of Skele-Gro. 
“Happy Valentine’s Day!” Lockha rt shouted. “And may I thank 
the forty-six people who have so far sent me cards! Ye s, I have taken 
the liberty of arranging this litt le surprise for you all — and it 
doesn’t end here!” 
Lockhart clapped his hands and through the doors to the 
entrance hall marched a dozen surly- looking dwarfs. Not just any 
dwarfs, however. Lockhart had th em all wearing golden wings and 
carrying harps. 
“My friendly, card-carrying cupi ds!” beamed Lockhart. “They 
will be roving around the school today delivering your valentines! 
And the fun doesn’t stop here! I’m sure my colleagues will want to 
enter into the spirit of the occa sion! Why not ask Professor Snape 
to show you how to whip up a Love Potion! And while you’re at it, 
Professor Flitwick knows more about Entrancing Enchantments 
than any wizard I’ve ever met, the sl y old dog!” 
Professor Flitwick buried his face in his hands. Snape was look- 
 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 237  ing as though the first person to ask him for a Love Potion would 
be force-fed poison. 
“Please, Hermione, tell me you we ren’t one of the forty-six,” said 
Ron as they left the Great Hall fo r their first lesson. Hermione sud-
denly became very interested in se arching her bag for her schedule 
and didn’t answer. 
All day long, the dwarfs kept barg ing into their classes to deliver 
valentines, to the annoyance of the teachers, and late that after-
noon as the Gryffindors were walking upstairs for Charms, one of 
the dwarfs caught up with Harry. 
“Oy, you! ’Arry Potter!” shoute d a particularly grim-looking 
dwarf, elbowing people out of the way to get to Harry. 
Hot all over at the thought of being given a valentine in front of 
a line of first years, which happe ned to include Ginny Weasley, 
Harry tried to escape. The dwarf, however, cut his way through the 
crowd by kicking people’s shins, and reached him before he’d gone 
two paces. 
“I’ve got a musical message to deli ver to ’Arry Potter in person,” 
he said, twanging his harp in a threatening sort of way. 
“Not here, ” Harry hissed, tr ying to escape. 
“Stay still!” grunted the dwarf, grabbi ng hold of Harry’s bag and 
pulling him back. 
“Let me go!” Harry snarled, tugging. 
With a loud ripping noise, his ba g split in two. His books, wand, 
parchment, and quill spilled onto the floor and his ink bottle 
smashed over everything. 
Harry scrambled around, trying to pi ck it all up before the dwarf 
started singing, causing somethin g of a holdup in the corridor. 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 238  “What’s going on here?” came the cold, drawling voice of Draco 
Malfoy. Harry started stuffing everyt hing feverishly into his ripped 
bag, desperate to get away before Malfoy could hear his musical 
valentine. 
“What’s all this commotion?” sa id another familiar voice as 
Percy Weasley arrived. 
Losing his head, Harry tried to make a run for it, but the dwarf 
seized him around the knees and br ought him crashing to the floor. 
“Right,” he said, sitting on Harry’ s ankles. “Here is your singing 
valentine: 
 
His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad, 
His hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he’s really divine, 
The hero who conquered the Dark Lord. ” 
 
Harry would have given all the gold in Gringotts to evaporate on 
the spot. Trying valiantly to laugh along with everyone else, he got 
up, his feet numb from the weight of the dwarf, as Percy Weasley did 
his best to disperse the crowd, some of whom were crying with mirth. 
“Off you go, off you go, the bell rang five minutes ago, off to 
class, now,” he said, shooing so me of the younger students away. 
“And you, Malfoy —” 
Harry, glancing over, saw Malf oy stoop and snatch up some-
thing. Leering, he showed it to Crabbe and Goyle, and Harry real-
ized that he’d go t Riddle’s diary. 
“Give that back,” sa id Harry quietly. 
“Wonder what Potter’s written in this?” said Malfoy, who obvi- 
 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 239  ously hadn’t noticed the year on the cover and thought he had 
Harry’s own diary. A hush fell ov er the onlookers. Ginny was star-
ing from the diary to Harry, looking terrified. 
“Hand it over, Malfoy,” said Percy sternly. 
“When I’ve had a look,” said Malfoy, waving the diary taunt-
ingly at Harry. 
Percy said, “As a school prefect —” but Harry had lost his tem-
per. He pulled out hi s wand and shouted, “ Expelliarmus !” and just 
as Snape had disarmed Lockhart, so Malfoy found the diary shoot-
ing out of his hand into the air. Ron, grinning broadly, caught it. 
“Harry!” said Percy loudly. “No magic in the corridors. I’ll have 
to report this, you know!” 
But Harry didn’t care, he was one-up on Malfoy, and that was 
worth five points from Gryffindor any day. Malfoy was looking fu-rious, and as Ginny pa ssed him to enter her classroo m, he yelled 
spitefully after her, “I don’t think Potter liked your valentine 
much!” 
Ginny covered her face with her hands and ran into class. 
Snarling, Ron pulled out his wa nd, too, but Ha rry pulled him 
away. Ron didn’t need to spend the whole of Charms belching 
slugs. 
It wasn’t until they had reached Professor Flitwick’s class that 
Harry noticed something rather o dd about Riddle’s diary. All his 
other books were drench ed in scarlet ink. The diary, however, was 
as clean as it had been before the ink bottle had smashed all over it. 
He tried to point this out to Ron, but Ron was having trouble with 
his wand again; large purple bubb les were blossoming out of the 
end, and he wasn’t much in terested in anything else. 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 240     
Harry went to bed before anyone else in his dormitory that night. 
This was partly because he didn’t think he could stand Fred and 
George singing, “His eyes are as green as a fresh pickled toad” one more time, and partly because he wanted to examine Riddle’s diary 
again, and knew that Ron thou ght he was wasting his time. 
Harry sat on his four-poster and flicked through the blank 
pages, not one of which had a trac e of scarlet ink on it. Then he 
pulled a new bottle out of his bedsid e cabinet, dipped his quill into 
it, and dropped a blot onto the first page of the diary. 
The ink shone brightly on the pa per for a second and then, as 
though it was being sucked into the page, vanished. Excited, Harry 
loaded up his quill a s e c o n d t i m e a n d w r o t e , “ M y n a m e i s H a r r y 
Potter.” 
The words shone momentarily on the page and they, too, sank 
without trace. Then, at last, something happened. 
Oozing back out of the page, in his very own ink, came words 
Harry had never written. 
“Hello, Harry Potter. My name is Tom Riddle. How did you come 
by my diary ?” 
These words, too, faded away, but not before Harry had started 
to scribble back. 
“Someone tried to flush it down a toilet.” He waited eagerly for Riddle’s reply. 
“Lucky that I recorded my memories in some more lasting way than 
ink. But I always knew that there would be those who would not want 
this diary read. ” 
“What do you mean?” Harry scrawled , blotting the page in his 
excitement. 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 241  “I mean that this diary holds memo ries of terrible things. Things 
that were covered up. Things that happened at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry. ” 
“That’s where I am now,” Harry wrote quickly. “I’m at Hog-
warts, and horrible stuff’s been happening. Do you know anything 
about the Chamber of Secrets?” 
His heart was hammering. Riddle’s reply came quickly, his writ-
ing becoming untidier, as though he was hurrying to tell all he 
knew. 
“Of course I know about the Chambe r of Secrets. In my day, they 
told us it was a legend, that it did not exist. But this was a lie. In my 
fifth year, the Chamber was opened and the monster attacked several 
students, finally killing one. I caught the person who’d opened the 
Chamber and he was expelled. But the headmaster, Professor Dippet, ashamed that such a thing had happened at Hogwarts, forbade me to 
tell the truth. A story was given out that the girl had died in a freak ac-
cident. They gave me a nice, shiny, engraved trophy for my trouble and 
warned me to keep my mouth shut. But I knew it could happen again. 
The monster lived on, and the one wh o had the power to release it was 
not imprisoned.” 
Harry nearly upset hi s ink bottle in his hurry to write back. 
“It’s happening again now. There have been three attacks and no 
one seems to know who’s behind them. Who was it last time?” 
“I can show you, if you like ,” came Riddle’s reply. “ You don’t have 
to take my word for it. I can take you inside my memory of the night 
when I caught him. ” 
Harry hesitated, his quill suspen ded over the diary. What did 
Riddle mean? How could he be take n inside somebody else’s mem-
ory? He glanced nervous ly at the door to th e dormitory, which was 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 242  growing dark. When he looked ba ck at the diary, he saw fresh 
words forming. 
“Let me show you. ” 
Harry paused for a fraction of a second and then wrote two 
letters. 
“OK.” 
The pages of the diary began to bl ow as though caught in a high 
wind, stopping halfway through the month of June. Mouth hang-
ing open, Harry saw th at the little square for June thirteenth 
seemed to have turned into a minuscule television screen. His hands trembling slightly, he raised the book to press his eye against 
the little window, and before he knew what was happening, he was 
tilting forward; the window was widening, he felt his body leave his bed, and he was pitched headfirst through the opening in the page, 
into a whirl of color and shadow. 
He felt his feet hit solid ground, and stood, shaking, as the 
blurred shapes around him came suddenly into focus. 
He knew immediately where he was. This circular room with the 
sleeping portraits was Dumbledore’s office — but it wasn’t 
Dumbledore who was sitting behin d the desk. A wizened, frail-
looking wizard, bald except for a few wisps of white hair, was read-
ing a letter by candleli ght. Harry had never se en this man before. 
“I’m sorry,” he said shakily. “I didn’t mean to butt in —” 
But the wizard didn’t look up. He continued to read, frowning 
slightly. Harry drew nearer to his desk and stammered, “Er — I’ll 
just go, shall I?” 
Still the wizard ignored him. He didn’t seem even to have heard 
h i m . T h i n k i n g t h a t t h e w i z a r d m i g h t b e d e a f , H a r r y r a i s e d h i s voice. 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 243  “Sorry I disturbed you. I’ll go now,” he half-shouted. 
The wizard folded up the letter with a sigh, stood up, walked 
past Harry without glancing at him, and went to draw the curtains 
at his window. 
The sky outside the window was ru by-red; it seemed to be sun-
set. The wizard went back to the desk, sat down, and twiddled his 
thumbs, watching the door. 
Harry looked around the office. No Fawkes the phoenix — no 
whirring silver contraptions. T his was Hogwarts as Riddle had 
known it, meaning that this unknown wizard was headmaster, not Dumbledore, and he, Harry, was lit tle more than a phantom, com-
pletely invisible to the pe ople of fifty years ago. 
There was a knock on the office door. “Enter,” said the old wiza rd in a feeble voice. 
A boy of about sixteen entered, ta king off his pointed hat. A sil-
ver prefect’s badge was glinting on h i s c h e s t . H e w a s m u c h t a l l e r 
than Harry, but he, to o, had jet-black hair. 
“Ah, Riddle,” said the headmaster. 
“You wanted to see me, Profes sor Dippet?” said Riddle. He 
looked nervous. 
“Sit down,” said Dippet. “I’ve ju st been reading the letter you 
sent me.” 
“Oh,” said Riddle. He sat down, gripping his hands together 
very tightly. 
“My dear boy,” said Dippet kind ly, “I cannot po ssibly let you 
stay at school over the summer. Surely you want to go home for the 
holidays?” 
“No,” said Riddle at once. “I’d much rather stay at Hogwarts 
than go back to that — to that —” 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 244  “You live in a Muggle orphanage during the holidays, I believe?” 
said Dippet curiously. 
“Yes, sir,” said Riddle , reddening slightly. 
“You are Muggle-born?” 
“Half-blood, sir,” said Riddle. “Muggle father, witch mother.” 
“And are both your parents — ?” 
“My mother died just after I was born, sir. They told me at the 
orphanage she lived just long eno ugh to name me — Tom after my 
father, Marvolo after my grandfather.” 
Dippet clucked his tongue sympathetically. “The thing is, Tom,” he sighed, “special arrangements might 
have been made for you, but in the current circumstances. . . .” 
“You mean all these attacks, sir?” said Riddle, and Harry’s heart 
leapt, and he moved closer, scared of missing anything. 
“Precisely,” said the headmaster. “My dear boy, you must see 
how foolish it would be of me to allow you to remain at the castle when term ends. Particular ly in light of the recent tragedy . . . the 
death of that poor little girl. . . . You will be safer by far at your or-
phanage. As a matter of fact, the Ministry of Magic is even now 
talking about closing the school. We are no nearer locating the — 
er — source of all this unpleasantness. . . .” 
Riddle’s eyes had widened. 
“Sir — if the person was caug ht — if it al l stopped —” 
“ W h a t d o y o u m e a n ? ” s a i d D i p p e t w i t h a s q u e a k i n h i s v o i c e , 
sitting up in his chair. “Riddle, do you mean you know something 
about these attacks?” 
“No, sir,” said Riddle quickly. 
But Harry was sure it was the same sort of “no” that he himself 
had given Dumbledore. 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 245  Dippet sank back, looking faintly disappointed. 
“You may go, Tom. . . .” 
Riddle slid off his chair and slou ched out of the room. Harry fol-
lowed him. 
Down the moving spiral staircase they went, emerging next to 
the gargoyle in the darkening co rridor. Riddle stopped, and so 
did Harry, watching him. Harry coul d tell that Riddle was doing 
some serious thinking. He was biting his lip, his forehead fur-rowed. 
Then, as though he had suddenly reached a decision, he hurried 
off, Harry gliding noisel essly behind him. They didn’t see another 
person until they reached the entran ce hall, when a tall wizard with 
long, sweeping auburn hair and a beard called to Riddle from the 
marble staircase. 
“What are you doing, wanderin g around this late, Tom?” 
Harry gaped at the wizard. He was none other than a fifty-year-
younger Dumbledore. 
“I had to see the headmaster, sir,” said Riddle. 
“Well, hurry off to bed,” said Dumbledore, giving Riddle ex-
actly the kind of penetrating star e Harry knew so well. “Best not to 
roam the corridors these days. Not since . . .” 
He sighed heavily, bade Riddle good night, and st rode off. Rid-
dle watched him walk out of si ght and then, moving quickly, 
headed straight down the stone st eps to the dungeons, with Harry 
in hot pursuit. 
But to Harry’s disappointment, Riddle led him not into a hid-
den passageway or a secret tunnel but to the very dungeon in which 
Harry had Potions with Snape. Th e torches hadn’t been lit, and 
when Riddle pushed the door almost closed, Harry could only just 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 246  see him, standing stock-still by the door, watching the passage out-
side. 
It felt to Harry that they were there for at least an hour. All he 
could see was the figure of Riddle at the door , staring through the 
crack, waiting like a statue. And just when Harry had stopped feel-
ing expectant and tense and started wishing he could return to the 
present, he heard someth ing move beyond the door. 
Someone was creeping along the passage. He heard whoever it 
was pass the dungeon where he an d Riddle were hidden. Riddle, 
quiet as a shadow, edged throug h the door and followed, Harry tip-
toeing behind him, forgetting that he couldn’t be heard. 
For perhaps five minu tes they followed the footsteps, until Rid-
dle stopped suddenly, his head in clined in the direction of new 
noises. Harry heard a door creak open, and then someone speaking 
in a hoarse whisper. 
“C’mon . . . gotta get yeh outta he re. . . . C’mon now . . . in the 
box . . .” 
There was something familiar about that voice. . . . 
Riddle suddenly jumped around the corner. Harry stepped 
out behind him. He could see th e dark outline of a huge boy 
who was crouching in fr ont of an open door, a very large box next 
to it. 
“ ’Evening, Rubeus,” said Riddle sharply. 
The boy slammed the door shut and stood up. 
“What yer doin’ do wn here, Tom?” 
Riddle stepped closer. “It’s all over,” he said. “I’m goin g to have to turn you in, Rubeus. 
They’re talking about closing Hogwarts if the attacks don’t stop.” 
 
THE VERY SECRET DIARY 
 247  “What d’yeh —” 
“I don’t think you meant to kill anyone. But monsters don’t 
make good pets. I suppose you just let it out for exercise and —” 
“It never killed no one!” said th e large boy, backing against the 
closed door. From behind him, Ha rry could hear a funny rustling 
and clicking. 
“Come on, Rubeus,” said Riddle, moving yet closer. “The dead 
girl’s parents will be here tomorrow. The least Hogwarts can do is 
make sure that the thing that killed their daughter is slaugh-
tered. . . .” 
“It wasn’t him!” roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark 
passage. “He woul dn’! He never!” 
“Stand aside,” said Riddle, drawing out his wand. His spell lit the corridor with a sudden flaming light. The door 
behind the large boy flew open with such force it knocked him into the wall opposite. And out of it came something that made Harry let out a long, piercing scream unheard by anyone — 
A vast, low-slung, hairy body and a tangle of black legs; a gleam 
of many eyes and a pair of razor-sharp pincers — Riddle raised his 
wand again, but he was too late. The thing bowled him over as it 
scuttled away, tearing up the corridor and out of sight. Riddle 
scrambled to his feet, looking after it; he raised his wand, but the 
huge boy leapt on him, seized his wand, and threw him back down, 
yelling, “NOOOOOOO!” 
The scene whirled, the darkne ss became complete; Harry felt 
himself falling and, with a crash, he landed spread-eagled on his four-poster in the Gryffindor dormitory, Riddle’s diary lying open on his stomach. 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 248  Before he had had time to rega in his breath, the dormitory door 
opened and Ron came in. 
“There you are,” he said. 
Harry sat up. He was sw eating and shaking. 
“What’s up?” said Ron, looking at him with concern. 
“It was Hagrid, Ron. Hagrid op ened the Chamber of Secrets 
fifty years ago.”

arry, Ron, and Hermione had always known that Hagrid had an unfortunate liking for large and monstrous crea-
tures. During their first year at Hogwarts he had tried to raise a dragon in his little wooden house, and it would be a long time 
before they forgot the giant, three-headed dog he’d christened 
“Fluffy.” And if, as a boy, Hagrid had heard that a monster was hid-
den somewhere in the castle, Harry was sure he’d have gone to any 
lengths for a glimpse of it. He’d probably thought it was a shame 
that the monster had been cooped up so long, and thought it de-
served the chance to stretch its many legs; Harry could just imag-
ine the thirteen-year-old Hagrid trying to fit a leash and collar on 
it. But he was equally certain that Hagrid would never have meant 
to kill anybody. 
Harry half wished he hadn’t foun d out how to work Riddle’s di-
ary. Again and again Ron and He rmione made him recount what 
 H 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 250  he’d seen, until he was heartily sick of telling them and sick of the 
long, circular conversations that followed. 
“Riddle might have got the wrong person,” said Hermione. 
“Maybe it was some other monster that was attacking people. . . .” 
“How many monsters d’you thin k this place can hold?” Ron 
asked dully. 
“We always knew Hagrid had been expelled,” said Harry miser-
ably. “And the attacks must’ve sto pped after Hagrid was kicked out. 
Otherwise, Riddle wouldn’t have got his award.” 
Ron tried a different tack. 
“Riddle does sound like Percy — who asked him to squeal on 
Hagrid, anyway?” 
“But the monster had killed someone, Ron,” said Hermione. 
“And Riddle was going to go back to some Muggle orphanage if 
they closed Hogwarts,” said Harr y. “I don’t blame him for wanting 
to stay here. . . .” 
“You met Hagrid down Knockturn Alley, didn’t you, Harry?” 
“He was buying a Flesh-Eating Slug Repellent,” said Harry 
quickly. 
The three of them fe ll silent. After a long pause, Hermione 
voiced the knottiest question of all in a hesitant voice. 
“Do you think we should go and ask Hagrid about it all?” 
“That’d be a cheerful visit,” said Ron. “ ‘Hello, Hagrid. Tell us, 
have you been setting anything mad and hairy loose in the castle 
lately?’ ” 
In the end, they decided that they would not say anything to 
Hagrid unless there was another atta ck, and as more and more days 
went by with no whisper from the disembodied voice, they became 
 
CORNELIUS FUDGE 
 251  hopeful that they would never need to talk to him about why he 
had been expelled. It was now nearly four months since Justin and 
Nearly Headless Nick had been Petrified, and nearly everybody 
seemed to think that the attacker , whoever it was, had retired for 
good. Peeves had finally got bored of his “Oh, Potter, you rotter” song, Ernie Macmillan asked Harry qu ite politely to pass a bucket 
of leaping toadstools in Herbolog y one day, and in March several 
of the Mandrakes threw a loud and raucous party in greenhouse three. This made Profe ssor Sprout very happy. 
“The moment they start trying to m o v e i n t o e a c h o t h e r ’ s p o t s , 
we’ll know they’re fully mature,” she told Harry. “Then we’ll be 
able to revive those poor pe ople in the hospital wing.” 
 
The second years were given some thing new to think about during 
their Easter holidays. The time ha d come to choose their subjects 
for the third year, a matter that He rmione, at least, took very seri-
ously. 
“It could affect our whole future,” she told Harry and Ron as 
they pored over lists of new subje cts, marking them with checks. 
“I just want to give up Potions,” said Harry. 
“We can’t,” said Ron gloomily. “We keep all our old subjects, or 
I’d’ve ditched Defense Ag ainst the Dark Arts.” 
“But that’s very important!” said Hermione, shocked. 
“Not the way Lockhart teaches it,” said Ron. “I haven’t learned 
anything from him except no t to set pixies loose.” 
Neville Longbottom had been sent letters from all the witches 
and wizards in his family, all giving him different advice on what to 
choose. Confused and worried, he sa t reading the subject lists with 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 252  his tongue poking out, asking people whether they thought Arith-
mancy sounded more difficult than the study of Ancient Runes. 
Dean Thomas, who, like Harry, had grown up with Muggles, ended up closing his eyes and jabb ing his wand at the list, then 
picking the subjects it landed on . Hermione took nobody’s advice 
but signed up for everything. 
Harry smiled grimly to himself at the thought of what Uncle 
Vernon and Aunt Petunia would say if he tried to discuss his career in wizardry with them. Not that he didn’t get any guidance: Percy 
Weasley was eager to share his experience. 
“Depends where you want to go, Harry,” he said. “It’s never too 
early to think about the future, so I’d recommend Divination. Peo-
ple say Muggle Studies is a soft option, but I personally think wiz-
ards should have a thorough understanding of the non-magical 
community, particularly if they’re thinking of working in close 
contact with them — look at my father, he has to deal with Mug-
gle business all the time. My brother Charlie was always more of an 
outdoor type, so he went for Care of Magical Creatures. Play to your 
strengths, Harry.” 
But the only thing Harry felt he was really good at was Quid-
ditch. In the end, he chose the same new subjects as Ron, feeling 
that if he was lousy at them, at le ast he’d have someone friendly to 
help him. 
 
Gryffindor’s next Quidditch match would be against Hufflepuff. 
Wood was insisting on team practi ces every night after dinner, so 
that Harry barely had time for an ything but Quidditch and home-
work. However, the training sessions were getting better, or at least 
 
CORNELIUS FUDGE 
 253  drier, and the evening before Satu rday’s match he went up to his 
dormitory to drop off his broomstic k feeling Gryffindor’s chances 
for the Quidditch Cup ha d never been better. 
But his cheerful mood didn’t last long. At the top of the stairs 
to the dormitory, he met Neville Longbottom, who was looking 
frantic. 
“Harry — I don’t kn ow who did it — I just found —” 
Watching Harry fearfully, Nevi lle pushed open the door. 
The contents of Harry’s trunk ha d been thrown everywhere. His 
cloak lay ripped on the floor. The bedclothes had been pulled off 
his four-poster and the drawer ha d been pulled out of his bedside 
cabinet, the contents st rewn over th e mattress. 
Harry walked over to the bed, openmouthed, treading on a few 
loose pages of Travels with Trolls. As he and Nevill e pulled the blan-
kets back onto his bed, Ron, Dean, and Seamus came in. Dean 
swore loudly. 
“What happened, Harry?” 
“No idea,” said Harry. But Ron wa s examining Harry’s robes. All 
the pockets were hanging out. 
“Someone’s been looking for some thing,” said Ron. “Is there 
anything missing?” 
Harry started to pick up all his things and throw them into his 
trunk. It was only as he threw th e last of the Lock hart books back 
into it that he realiz ed what wasn’t there. 
“Riddle’s diary’s gone,” he sa id in an unde rtone to Ron. 
“What ?” 
Harry jerked his head toward the dormitory door and Ron fol-
lowed him out. They hurried down to the Gryffindor common 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 254  room, which was half-empty, and joined Hermione, who was sit-
ting alone, reading a book called Ancient Runes Made Easy. 
Hermione looked aghast at the news. 
“But — only a Gryffindor could have stolen — nobody else 
knows our password —” 
“Exactly,” said Harry. 
They woke the next day to brilliant sunshine and a light, refreshing breeze. 
“Perfect Quidditch co nditions!” said Wood enthusiastically at 
the Gryffindor table, loading the te am’s plates with scrambled eggs. 
“Harry, buck up there, you need a decent breakfast.” 
Harry had been staring down the packed Gryffindor table, won-
dering if the new owner of Riddle’s diary was right in front of his 
eyes. Hermione had been urging him to report the robbery, but 
Harry didn’t like the idea. He’d ha ve to tell a teac her all about the 
diary, and how many people knew why Hagrid had been expelled 
fifty years ago? He didn’t want to be the one who brought it all up 
again. 
As he left the Great Hall with Ron and Hermione to go and col-
lect his Quidditch things, another very serious worry was added to 
Harry’s growing list. He had just se t foot on the marble staircase 
when he heard it yet again — 
“Kill this time . . . let me rip . . . tear . . .” 
He shouted aloud and Ron and Hermione both jumped away 
from him in alarm. 
“The voice!” said Harry, looking over his shoulder . “I just heard 
it again — didn’t you?” 
 
CORNELIUS FUDGE 
 255  Ron shook his head, wide-eyed. Hermione, however, clapped a 
hand to her forehead. 
“Harry — I think I’ve just understood something! I’ve got to go 
to the library!” 
And she sprinted away, up the stairs. 
“What does she understand?” said Ha rry distractedly, still look-
ing around, trying to tell where the voice had come from. 
“Loads more than I do,” sa id Ron, shaking his head. 
“But why’s she got to go to the library?” 
“Because that’s what Hermione does,” said Ron, shrugging. 
“When in doubt, go to the library.” 
Harry stood, irresolute, trying to catch the voice again, but 
people were now emerging from th e Great Hall behind him, talk-
ing loudly, exiting th rough the front doors on their way to the 
Quidditch pitch. 
“You’d better get moving,” said Ron. “It’s nearly eleven — the 
match —” 
Harry raced up to Gr yffindor Tower, coll ected his Nimbus Two 
Thousand, and joined the larg e crowd swarming across the 
grounds, but his mind was still in the castle along with the bodiless 
voice, and as he pulled on his scar let robes in the locker room, his 
only comfort was that everyone was now outside to watch the 
game. 
The teams walked onto the field to tumultuous applause. Oliver 
Wood took off for a warm-up flight around the goal posts; Madam 
Hooch released the balls. The Hu fflepuffs, who played in canary 
yellow, were standing in a huddle, having a last-minute discussion 
of tactics. 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 256  Harry was just mounting his broom when Professor McGona-
gall came half marching , half running across the pitch, carrying an 
enormous purple megaphone. 
Harry’s heart dropped like a stone. 
“This match has been canceled,” Professor McGonagall called 
through the megaphone, addressing the packed stadium. There were 
boos and shouts. Oliver Wood, l ooking devastated, landed and ran 
toward Professor McGonagall without getting off his broomstick. 
“But, Professor!” he shouted. “We’ve got to play — the Cup — 
Gryffindor —” 
Professor McGonagall ignored him and continued to shout 
through her megaphone: 
“All students are to make thei r way back to the House common 
rooms, where their Heads of Houses will give them further infor-mation. As quickly as you can, please!” 
Then she lowered the megaphone and beckoned Harry over to 
her. 
“Potter, I think you’d bette r come with me. . . .” 
Wondering how she could possibly suspect him this time, Harry 
saw Ron detach himself from the complaining crowd; he came 
running up to them as they set o ff toward the castle. To Harry’s sur-
prise, Professor McGona gall didn’t object. 
“Yes, perhaps you’d better co me, too, Weasley. . . .” 
Some of the students swarming around them were grumbling 
about the match being canceled; others looked worried. Harry and 
Ron followed Professor McGonagall back into the school and up 
the marble staircase. But they were n’t taken to anybody’s office this 
time. 
 
CORNELIUS FUDGE 
 257  “This will be a bit of a shock,” said Professor McGonagall in a 
surprisingly gentle voice as they approached the infirmary. “There 
has been another a ttack . . . another double attack.” 
Harry’s insides did a horrible so mersault. Professor McGonagall 
pushed the door open an d he and Ron entered. 
Madam Pomfrey was bending over a sixth-year girl with long, 
curly hair. Harry recognized her as the Ravenclaw they’d acciden-
tally asked for directions to the Slytherin common room. And on 
the bed next to her was — 
“H e r m i o n e !” Ron groaned. 
Hermione lay utterly still, her eyes open and glassy. 
“They were found near the librar y,” said Professor McGonagall. 
“I don’t suppose either of you can explain this? It was on the floor 
next to them. . . .” 
She was holding up a small, circular mirror. Harry and Ron shook their heads, both staring at Hermione. “I will escort you back to Gryffindor Tower,” said Profes-
sor McGonagall heavily. “I need to address the st udents in any 
case.” 
 
“All students will return to th eir House common rooms by six 
o’clock in the evening. No student is to leave the dormitories after 
that time. You will be escorted to each lesson by a teacher. No stu-
dent is to use the bathroom unaccompanied by a te acher. All fur-
ther Quidditch training and matc hes are to be postponed. There 
will be no more ev ening activities.” 
The Gryffindors packed inside the common room listened to 
Professor McGonagall in silence. She rolled up the parchment 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 258  from which she had been reading and said in a somewhat choked 
voice, “I need hardly add that I ha ve rarely been so distressed. It is 
likely that the school will be closed unless the culprit behind these 
attacks is caught. I would urge anyone who thinks they might 
know anything about them to come forward.” 
She climbed somewhat awkwardly out of the portrait hole, and 
the Gryffindors began talking immediately. 
“That’s two Gryffindors down, not counting a Gryffindor ghost, 
one Ravenclaw, and one Hufflepuff,” said the Weasley twins’ friend 
Lee Jordan, counting on his fingers. “Haven’t any of the teachers 
noticed that the Slytherins are all safe? Isn’t it obvious all this stuff’s 
coming from Slytherin? The Heir of Slytherin, the monster of 
Slytherin — why don’t th ey just chuck all the Slytherins out?” he 
roared, to nods and scattered applause. 
Percy Weasley was sitting in a chai r behind Lee, but for once he 
didn’t seem keen to ma ke his views heard. He was looking pale and 
stunned. 
“Percy’s in shock,” George told Harry quietly. “That Ravenclaw 
girl — Penelope Clearwater — she’s a prefect. I don’t think he 
thought the monster wo uld dare attack a prefect. ” 
But Harry was only half-listening. He didn’t seem to be able to 
get rid of the picture of Hermione, lying on the hospital bed as 
though carved out of st one. And if the culprit wasn’t caught soon, 
he was looking at a lifetime back with the Dursleys. Tom Riddle 
had turned Hagrid in because he was faced with the prospect of a 
Muggle orphanage if the school closed. Harry now knew exactly 
how he had felt. 
“What’re we going to do?” said Ron quietly in Harry’s ear. 
“D’you think they suspect Hagrid?” 
CORNELIUS FUDGE 
 259  “We’ve got to go and talk to him,” said Harry, making up his 
mind. “I can’t believe it’s him this time, but if he set the monster 
loose last time he’ll know how to get inside the Chamber of Secrets, and that’s a start.” 
“But McGonagall said we’ve got to stay in our tower unless we’re 
in class —” 
“I think,” said Harry, more quietly still, “it’s time to get my dad’s 
old cloak out again.” 
 
Harry had inherited just one thing from his father: a long and sil-
very Invisibility Cloak. It was their only chance of sneaking out of the school to visit Hagrid with out anyone knowing about it. They 
went to bed at the usual time, wa ited until Neville, Dean, and Sea-
mus had stopped discussing the Chamber of Secrets and finally 
fallen asleep, then got up, dressed again, and threw the cloak over 
themselves. 
The journey through the dark and deserted castle corridors 
wasn’t enjoyable. Harry, who had wa ndered the castle at night sev-
eral times before, had never seen it so crowded after sunset. Teach-
ers, prefects, and ghosts were ma rching the corridors in pairs, 
staring around for any unusual ac tivity. Their Invisibility Cloak 
didn’t stop them making any noise, and there was a particularly 
tense moment when Ron stubbed his toe only yards from the spot 
where Snape stood standing guard. Thankfully, Snape sneezed at 
almost exactly the moment Ron swor e. It was with relief that they 
reached the oak front door s and eased them open. 
It was a clear, starry night. They hurried toward the lit windows 
of Hagrid’s house and pulled off the cloak only wh en they were 
right outside his front door. 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 260  Seconds after they had knocked, Hagrid flung it open. They 
found themselves face-to-face with him aiming a crossbow at them. 
Fang the boarhound barked loudly behind him. 
“Oh,” he said, lowering the weapon and staring at them. 
“What’re you two doin’ here?” 
“What’s that for?” said Harry, poin ting at the crossbow as they 
stepped inside. 
“Nothin’ — nothin’ — “ Hagrid muttered. “I’ve bin expectin’ — 
doesn’ matter — Sit down — I’ll make tea —” 
He hardly seemed to know what he was doing. He nearly extin-
guished the fire, spilling water from the kettle on it, and then 
smashed the teapot with a nerv ous jerk of hi s massive hand. 
“Are you okay, Hagrid?” said Harry. “Did you hear about 
Hermione?” 
“Oh, I heard, all righ’,” said Hagrid, a slight break in his voice. He kept glancing nervously at the windows. He poured them 
both large mugs of boiling water (he had forgotten to add tea bags) 
and was just putting a slab of frui tcake on a plate when there was a 
loud knock on the door. 
Hagrid dropped the fruitcake. Harry and Ron exchanged panic-
stricken looks, then threw the In visibility Cloak back over them-
selves and retreated into a corner . Hagrid checked that they were 
hidden, seized his crossbow, and flung open his door once more. 
“Good evening, Hagrid.” It was Dumbledore. He entered, looking deadly serious, and was 
followed by a second, very odd-looking man. 
The stranger had rumpled gray ha ir and an anxious expression, 
and was wearing a strange mixture of clothes: a pinstriped suit, a 
 
CORNELIUS FUDGE 
 261  scarlet tie, a long black cloak, an d pointed purple boots. Under his 
arm he carried a lime-green bowler. 
“That’s Dad’s boss!” Ron breathed . “Cornelius Fudge, the Min-
ister of Magic!” 
Harry elbowed Ron hard to make him shut up. 
Hagrid had gone pale and sweaty . He dropped into one of his 
chairs and looked from Dumb ledore to Cornelius Fudge. 
“Bad business, Hagrid,” said Fu dge in rather clipped tones. 
“Very bad business. Had to come. Four attacks on Muggle-borns. 
Things’ve gone far enough. Ministry’s got to act.” 
“I never,” said Hagrid, lookin g imploringly at Dumbledore. 
“You know I never, Pro fessor Dumbledore, sir —” 
“I want it understood, Cornelius, that Hagrid has my full confi-
dence,” said Dumbledore , frowning at Fudge. 
“Look, Albus,” said Fudge, unco mfortably. “Hagrid’s record’s 
against him. Ministry’s got to do something — the school gover-
nors have been in touch —” 
“Yet again, Cornelius, I tell you that taking Hagrid away will not 
help in the slightest,” said Dumbledore. His blue eyes were full of 
a fire Harry had never seen before. 
“Look at it from my point of view ,” said Fudge, fidgeting with his 
bowler. “I’m under a lot of pressure . Got to be seen to be doing some-
thing. If it turns out it wasn’t Hagrid, he’ll be back and no more said. 
But I’ve got to take him. Got to. Wouldn’t be doing my duty —” 
“Take me?” said Hagrid, who was trembling. “Take me where?” 
“For a short stretch only,” said Fudge, not meeting Hagrid’s eyes. 
“Not a punishment, Hagrid, more a precaution. If someone else is caught, you’ll be let out with a full apology —” 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 262  “Not Azkaban?” croaked Hagrid. 
Before Fudge could answer, there was another loud rap on the 
door. 
Dumbledore answered it. It was Ha rry’s turn for an elbow in the 
ribs; he’d let out an audible gasp. 
Mr. Lucius Malfoy strode into Ha grid’s hut, swathed in a long 
black traveling cloak, smiling a cold and satisfied smile. Fang 
started to growl. 
“Already here, Fudge,” he said approvingly. “Good, good . . .” 
“What’re you doin’ here?” said Ha grid furiously. “Get outta my 
house!” 
“My dear man, please believe me, I have no pleasure at all in be-
ing inside your — er — d’you call this a house?” said Lucius Mal-
foy, sneering as he looked around the small cabin. “I simply called 
at the school and wa s told that the head master was here.” 
“ A n d w h a t e x a c t l y d i d y o u w a n t w i t h m e , L u c i u s ? ” s a i d D u m -
bledore. He spoke politely, but the fire was still blazing in his blue 
eyes. 
“Dreadful thing, Dumbledore,” said Malfoy lazily, taking out a 
long roll of parchment, “but the go vernors feel it’s time for you to 
step aside. This is an Order of Suspension — you’ll find all twelve 
signatures on it. I’m afraid we fee l you’re losing your touch. How 
many attacks have there been now? Two more this afternoon, 
wasn’t it? At this rate, there’ll be no Muggle-borns left at Hogwarts, 
and we all know what an awful loss that would be to the school.” 
“Oh, now, see here, Lucius,” said Fudge, looking alarmed, 
“Dumbledore suspended — no, no — last thing we want just 
now —” 
CORNELIUS FUDGE 
 263  “The appointment — or suspensio n — of the headmaster is a 
matter for the governors, Fudge,” said Mr. Malfoy smoothly. “And 
as Dumbledore has failed to stop these attacks —” 
“See here, Malfoy, if Dumbledore can’t stop them,” said Fudge, 
whose upper lip was sweating now, “I mean to say, who can?” 
“That remains to be seen,” said Mr. Malfoy with a nasty smile. 
“But as all twelve of us have voted —” 
Hagrid leapt to his feet, his shaggy black head grazing the ceil-
ing. 
“An’ how many did yeh have te r threaten an’ blackmail before 
they agreed, Malfoy, eh?” he roared. 
“Dear, dear, you know, that temper of yours will lead you into 
trouble one of these days, Hagrid,” said Mr. Malfoy. “I would ad-
vise you not to shout at the Azka ban guards like that. They won’t 
like it at all.” 
“Yeh can’ take Dumbledore!” yelled Hagrid, making Fang the 
boarhound cower and whimper in his basket. “Take him away, an’ 
the Muggle-borns won’ stand a chan ce! There’ll be killin’ next!” 
“Calm yourself, Hagrid,” said Dumbledore sharply. He looked 
at Lucius Malfoy. 
“If the governors want my removal, Lucius, I shall of course step 
aside —” 
“But —” stuttered Fudge. 
“No!” growled Hagrid. 
Dumbledore had not taken his brig ht blue eyes off Lucius Mal-
foy’s cold gray ones. 
“However,” said Dumbledore, speaking very slowly and clearly 
so that none of them could miss a word, “you will find that I will 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 264  only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to me. You 
will also find that help will always b e g i v e n a t H o g w a r t s t o t h o s e 
who ask for it.” 
For a second, Harry was almost su re Dumbledore’s eyes flickered 
toward the corner where he and Ron stood hidden. 
“Admirable sentiments,” said Ma lfoy, bowing. “We shall all miss 
your — er — highly individual way of running things, Albus, and 
only hope that your successor will manage to prevent any — ah — 
killins. ” 
He strode to the cabin door, op ened it, and bowed Dumbledore 
out. Fudge, fiddling with his bowler, waited for Hagrid to go ahead 
of him, but Hagrid stood his ground , took a deep breath, and said 
carefully, “If anyone want ed ter find out some stuff, all they’d have 
ter do would be ter follow the spiders. That’d lead ’em right! That’s 
all I’m sayin’.” 
Fudge stared at hi m in amazement. 
“All right, I’m comin’,” said Ha grid, pulling on his moleskin 
overcoat. But as he was about to follow Fudge through the door, he 
stopped again and said loudly, “A n’ someone’ll need ter feed Fang 
while I’m away.” 
The door banged shut an d Ron pulled off the Invisibility Cloak. 
“We’re in trouble now,” he said hoarsely. “No Dumbledore. 
They might as well close the school tonight. There’ll be an attack a 
day with him gone.” 
Fang started howling, scra tching at the closed door.

ummer was creeping over the gr ounds around the castle; sky 
and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cab-
bages burst into bloom in the gree nhouses. But with no Hagrid vis-
ible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his 
heels, the scene didn’t look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than 
the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong. 
Harry and Ron had tried to visi t Hermione, but visitors were 
now barred from the hospital wing. 
“We’re taking no mo re chances,” Madam Po mfrey told them se-
verely through a crack in the infi rmary door. “No, I’m sorry, there’s 
every chance the attacker might co me back to finish these people 
off. . . .” 
With Dumbledore gone, fear had spre ad as never before, so that 
the sun warming the castle walls ou tside seemed to stop at the mul-
lioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school S 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 266  that didn’t look worried and tens e, and any laughter that rang 
through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was 
quickly stifled. 
Harry constantly repeated Dumble dore’s final words to himself. 
“I will only truly have left this school when none here are loyal to 
me. . . . Help will always be given at Hogwarts to those who ask for 
it.” But what good were these words? Who exactly were they sup-
posed to ask for help, when eve ryone was just as confused and 
scared as they were? 
Hagrid’s hint about the spiders was far easier to understand — 
the trouble was, there didn’t seem to be a single spider left in the 
castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather 
reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact 
that they weren’t allowed to wand er off on their own but had to 
move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most 
of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shep-
herded from class to class by te achers, but Harry found it very irk-
some. 
One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the at-
mosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting 
around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. 
Harry didn’t realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions 
lesson about two weeks after Du mbledore and Hagrid had left, 
when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating 
to Crabbe and Goyle. 
“I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dum-
bledore,” he said, not troubling to keep his voice down. “I told you 
he thinks Dumbledore’s the worst headmaster the school’s ever 
 
ARAGOG 
 267  had. Maybe we’ll get a decent headmaster now. Someone who 
won’t want the Chamber of Secrets clos ed. McGonagall won’t last 
long, she’s only fi lling in. . . .” 
Snape swept past Harry, making no comment about Hermione’s 
empty seat and cauldron. 
“Sir,” said Malfoy loudly. “Sir, why don’t you apply for the head-
master’s job?” 
“Now, now, Malfoy,” said Snape, though he couldn’t suppress a 
thin-lipped smile. “Professor Dumbledore has only been suspended by the governors. I daresay he’ll be back with us soon enough.” 
“Yeah, right,” said Malfoy, smir king. “I expect you’d have Fa-
ther’s vote, sir, if you wanted to apply for the job — I’ll tell Father 
you’re the best te acher here, sir —” 
Snape smirked as he swept off around the dungeon, fortunately 
not spotting Seamus Finnigan, who was pretending to vomit into 
his cauldron. 
“I’m quite surprised the Mudbloods haven’t all packed their bags 
by now,” Malfoy went on. “Bet you five Galleons the next one dies. 
Pity it wasn’t Granger —” 
The bell rang at that moment, whic h was lucky; at Malfoy’s last 
words, Ron had leapt off his stool, and in the scramble to collect 
bags and books, his attempts to reach Malfoy went unnoticed. 
“Let me at him,” Ron growled as Harry and Dean hung onto his 
arms. “I don’t care, I don’t need my wand, I’m going to kill him 
with my bare hands —” 
“Hurry up, I’ve got to take you all to Herbology,” barked Snape 
over the class’s heads, and off they marched, with Harry, Ron, and 
Dean bringing up the rear, Ron still trying to get loos e. It was only 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 268  safe to let go of him when Snape had seen them out of the castle 
and they were making their way across the vegetable patch toward 
the greenhouses. 
The Herbology class was very su bdued; there were now two 
missing from their number, Justin and Hermione. 
Professor Sprout set them all to work pruning the Abyssinian 
Shrivelfigs. Harry went to tip an ar mful of withered stalks onto the 
compost heap and found himself fa ce-to-face with Ernie Macmil-
lan. Ernie took a deep breath and said, very formally, “I just want 
to say, Harry, that I’m sorry I ever suspected you. I know you’d 
never attack Hermione Granger, an d I apologize for all the stuff I 
said. We’re all in the same boat now, and, well —” 
He held out a pudgy ha nd, and Harry shook it. 
Ernie and his friend Hannah came to work at the same Shrivelfig 
as Harry and Ron. 
“That Draco Malfoy character,” sa id Ernie, breaking off dead 
twigs, “he seems very pleased ab out all this, do esn’t he? D’you 
know, I think he might be Slytherin’s heir.” 
“That’s clever of you,” said Ron, who didn’t seem to have for-
given Ernie as readily as Harry. 
“Do you think it’s Malfoy, Harry?” Ernie asked. “No,” said Harry, so firmly that Ernie and Hannah stared. 
A second later, Harr y spotted something. 
Several large spiders were scuttling over the ground on the other 
side of the glass, moving in an u nnaturally straight line as though 
taking the shortest route to a prearranged meeting. Harry hit Ron over the hand with his pruning shears. 
“Ouch ! What’re you —” 
 
ARAGOG 
 269  Harry pointed out the spiders, fo llowing their progress with his 
eyes screwed up against the sun. 
“O h, ye ah, ” sa id Ro n, tryi ng, an d fai lin g, to lo o k p le ase d . “B ut 
we can’t follow them now —” 
Ernie and Hannah were listening curiously. 
Harry’s eyes narrowed as he focused on the spiders. If they pur-
sued their fixed course, there could be no doubt about where they 
would end up. 
“Looks like they’re heading fo r the Forbidden Forest. . . .” 
And Ron looked even unhappier about that. 
At the end of the lesson Professo r Sprout escorted the class to 
their Defense Against the Dark Ar ts lesson. Harry and Ron lagged 
behind the others so they co uld talk out of earshot. 
“We’ll have to use th e Invisibility Cloak ag ain,” Harry told Ron. 
“We can take Fang with us. He’s us ed to going into the forest with 
Hagrid, he might be some help.” 
“Right,” said Ron, who was twir ling his wand nervously in his 
fingers. “Er — aren’t there — aren’t there supposed to be were-
wolves in the forest?” he added as they took their usual places at the 
back of Lockhart’s classroom. 
Preferring not to answer that question, Harry said, “There are 
good things in there, too. The centaurs are all right, and the uni-
corns . . .” 
Ron had never been into the Forb idden Forest before. Harry had 
entered it only once and had hoped never to do so again. 
Lockhart bounded into the room and the class stared at him. 
Every other teacher in the place was looking grimmer than usual, 
but Lockhart appeared nothing short of buoyant. 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 270  “Come now,” he cried, beaming around him. “Why all these 
long faces?” 
People swapped exasperated lo oks, but nobody answered. 
“Don’t you people realize,” said Lockhart, speaking slowly, as 
though they were all a bit dim, “t he danger has passed! The culprit 
has been taken away —” 
“Says who?” said Dean Thomas loudly. 
“My dear young man, the Minist e r o f M a g i c w o u l d n ’ t h a v e 
taken Hagrid if he hadn’t been one hundred percent sure that he 
was guilty,” said Lockhart, in th e tone of someone explaining that 
one and one made two. 
“Oh, yes he would,” said Ron, even more loudly than Dean. 
“I flatter myself I know a touch more about Hagrid’s arrest than 
you do, Mr. Weasley,” said Lockha rt in a self-satisfied tone. 
Ron started to say that he didn’t think so, somehow, but stopped 
in midsentence when Harry kick ed him hard under the desk. 
“We weren’t there, remember?” Harry muttered. But Lockhart’s disgusting cheeri ness, his hints that he had al-
ways thought Hagrid was no good, his confidence that the whole 
business was now at an end, irritated Harry so much that he 
yearned to throw Gadding with Ghouls right in Lockhart’s stupid 
face. Instead he contented himself with scrawling a note to Ron: 
Let’s do it tonight. 
Ron read the message, swallowed hard, and looked sideways at 
the empty seat usually filled by Hermione. The sight seemed to 
stiffen his resolve, and he nodded. 
 
The Gryffindor common room wa s always very crowded these 
days, because from si x o’clock onward the Gryffindors had no-
ARAGOG 
 271  where else to go. They al so had plenty to talk about, with the result 
that the common room often didn’t empty until past midnight. 
Harry went to get the Invisibility Cloak out of his trunk right af-
ter dinner, and spent the evening sitt ing on it, waiting for the room 
to clear. Fred and George chal lenged Harry and Ron to a few 
games of Exploding Snap, and Gi nny sat watching them, very sub-
dued in Hermione’s usua l chair. Harry and Ron kept losing on pur-
pose, trying to finish the games quickly, but even so, it was well 
past midnight when Fred, George, and Ginny finally went to bed. 
Harry and Ron waited for the dist ant sounds of two dormitory 
doors closing before seizing the cloa k, throwing it over themselves, 
and climbing through the portrait hole. 
It was another difficult journey through the castle, dodging all 
the teachers. At last th ey reached the entrance hall, slid back the 
lock on the oak front doors, squeez ed between them, trying to stop 
any creaking, and stepped out into the moonlit grounds. 
“’ C o u r s e , ” s a i d R o n a b r u p t l y a s they strode across the black 
grass, “we might get to the forest and find there’s nothing to follow. 
Those spiders might not’ve been going there at all. I know it looked 
like they were moving in that sort of general direction, but . . .” 
His voice trailed away hopefully. 
They reached Hagrid’s house, sad and sorry-looking with its 
blank windows. When Harry push ed the door open, Fang went 
mad with joy at the sight of them. Worried he might wake 
everyone at the castle with his deep, booming barks, they hastily 
fed him treacle toffee from a tin on the mantelpiece, which glued 
his teeth together. 
Harry left the Invisibility Cloak on Hagrid’s table. There would 
be no need for it in the pitch-dark forest. 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 272  “C’mon, Fang, we’re going for a walk,” said Harry, patting his 
leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, 
dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large 
sycamore tree. 
Harry took out his wand, murmured, “ Lumos !” and a tiny light 
appeared at the end of it, just en ough to let them watch the path 
for signs of spiders. 
“ G o o d t h i n k i n g , ” s a i d R o n . “ I ’ d l i g h t m i n e , t o o , b u t y o u 
know — it’d probably blow up or something. . . .” 
Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder , pointing at the grass. Two 
solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the 
shade of the trees. 
“Okay,” Ron sighed as though resi gned to the worst, “I’m ready. 
Let’s go.” 
So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and 
leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry’s wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They 
walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, lis-
tening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. 
Then, when the trees had become thic ker than ever, so that the stars 
overhead were no longer visible, and Harry’s wand shone alone in 
the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path. 
Harry paused, trying to see wher e the spiders were going, but 
everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He 
had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly 
remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time 
he’d been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders. 
 
ARAGOG 
 273  Something wet touched Harry’s ha nd and he jumped backward, 
crushing Ron’s foot, but it was only Fang’s nose. 
“What d’you reckon?” Harry said to Ron, whose eyes he could 
just make out, reflecting the light from his wand. 
“We’ve come this far,” said Ron. 
So they followed the darting sh adows of the spiders into the 
trees. They couldn’t move very quickly now; there were tree roots 
and stumps in their way, barely vi sible in the near blackness. Harry 
could feel Fang’s hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crou ch down and find the spiders in 
the wandlight. 
They walked for what seemed like at least half an hour, their 
robes snagging on low-slung branches and brambles. After a while, 
they noticed that the ground se emed to be sloping downward, 
though the trees were as thick as ever. 
Then Fang suddenly let loose a great, echoing bark, making 
both Harry and Ron jump out of their skins. 
“What?” said Ron loudly, lookin g around into the pitch-dark, 
and gripping Harry’ s elbow very hard. 
“There’s something moving over there,” Harry breathed. “Lis-
ten . . . sounds like something big. . . .” 
They listened. Some distance to their right, the something big 
was snapping branches as it ca rved a path through the trees. 
“Oh, no,” said Ron. “Oh, no, oh, no, oh —” “Shut up,” said Harry franti cally. “It’ll hear you.” 
“Hear me?” said Ron i n an unn at ura lly high voice. “It’s already 
heard Fang!” 
The darkness seemed to be pressing on their eyeballs as they 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 274  stood, terrified, waiting. There wa s a strange rumbling noise and 
then silence. 
“What d’you think it’s doing?” said Harry. 
“Probably getting ready to pounce,” said Ron. 
They waited, shivering, hardly daring to move. 
“D’you think it’s gone ?” Harry whispered. 
“Dunno —” 
Then, to their right, came a sudden blaze of light, so bright in 
the darkness that both of them flung up their hands to shield their eyes. Fang yelped and tried to run, but got lodged in a tangle of 
thorns and yelped even louder. 
“Harry!” Ron shouted, his voice br eaking with relief. “Harry, it’s 
our car!” 
“What ?” 
“Come on!” 
Harry blundered after Ron toward the light, stumbling and trip-
ping, and a moment later they had emerged into a clearing. 
Mr. Weasley’s car was standing, empty, in the middle of a circle 
of thick trees under a roof of dens e branches, its headlights ablaze. 
As Ron walked, openmouthed, toward it, it moved slowly toward 
him, exactly like a large, turq uoise dog greeting its owner. 
“It’s been here all the time!” said Ron delightedly, walking 
around the car. “Look at it. The forest’s tu rned it wild. . . .” 
The sides of the car were scratc hed and smeared with mud. Ap-
parently it had taken to trundling around the forest on its own. 
F a n g d i d n ’ t s e e m a t a l l k e e n o n i t ; h e k e p t c l o s e t o H a r r y , w h o 
could feel him quivering. His brea thing slowing down again, Harry 
stuffed his wand back into his robes. 
 
ARAGOG 
 275  “And we thought it was going to attack us!” said Ron, leaning 
against the car and patting it. “I wondered where it had gone!” 
Harry squinted around on the floodlit ground for signs of more 
spiders, but they had all scuttled away from the glare of the head-
lights. 
“We’ve lost the trail,” he said. “C’mon, let’s go and find them.” 
Ron didn’t speak. He didn’t move. His eyes were fixed on a point 
some ten feet above the forest floor, right behind Harry. His face 
was livid with terror. 
Harry didn’t even have time to turn around. There was a loud 
clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize 
him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was 
hanging facedown. Struggling, terri fied, he heard more clicking, 
and saw Ron’s legs leave the grou nd, too, heard Fang whimpering 
and howling — next moment, he was being swept away into the 
dark trees. 
Head hanging, Harry saw that what had hold of him was march-
ing on six immensely long, hairy legs, the front two clutching him 
tightly below a pair of shining black pincers. Behind him, he could 
hear another of the creatures, no doubt carrying Ron. They were 
moving into the very heart of th e forest. Harry could hear Fang 
fighting to free himself from a th ird monster, whining loudly, but 
Harry couldn’t have yelled even if he had wanted to; he seemed to 
have left his voice back wi th the car in the clearing. 
He never knew how long he was in the creature’s clutches; he 
only knew that the darkness suddenl y lifted enough for him to see 
that the leaf-strewn ground was no w swarming with spiders. Cran-
ing his neck sideways, he realized that they ha d reached the ridge of 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 276  a vast hollow, a hollow that had been cleared of trees, so that the 
stars shone brightly onto the worst scene he had ever laid eyes on. 
Spiders. Not tiny spiders like thos e surging over the leaves below. 
Spiders the size of carthorses, eigh t-eyed, eight-legged, black, hairy, 
gigantic. The massive specimen that was carrying Harry made its 
way down the steep slope toward a misty, domed web in the very 
center of the hollow, while its fellows closed in all around it, click-
ing their pincers excitedly at the sight of its load. 
Harry fell to the ground on all fo urs as the spider released him. 
Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn’t howling 
anymore, but cowering silently on the spot. Ron looked exactly 
like Harry felt. His mouth was stretc hed wide in a kind of silent 
scream and his eyes were popping. 
Harry suddenly realized that th e spider that had dropped him 
was saying something. It had been hard to tell, because he clicked 
his pincers with ever y word he spoke. 
“Aragog!” it called. “Aragog!” 
And from the middle of the misty, domed web, a spider the size 
of a small elephant emerged, ve ry slowly. There was gray in the 
black of his body and legs, and ea ch of the eyes on his ugly, pin-
cered head was milky w hite. He was blind. 
“What is it?” he said, clicking his pincers rapidly. “Men,” clicked the spider who had caught Harry. 
“Is it Hagrid?” said Aragog, moving closer, his eight milky eyes 
wandering vaguely. 
“Strangers,” clicked the spider who had brought Ron. “Kill them,” clicked Aragog fretfully. “I was sleeping. . . .” “We’re friends of Hagrid’s,” Harry shouted. His heart seemed to 
have left his chest to pound in his throat. 
ARAGOG 
 277  Click, click, click went the pincers of the spiders all around the 
hollow. 
Aragog paused. 
“Hagrid has never sent men into our hollow before,” he said 
slowly. 
“Hagrid’s in trouble,” said Harr y, breathing very fast. “That’s 
why we’ve come.” 
“In trouble?” said the aged spid er, and Harry thought he heard 
concern beneath the clicking pincer s. “But why has he sent you?” 
Harry thought of getting to his f eet but decided against it; he 
didn’t think his legs would support him. So he spoke from the ground, as calmly as he could. 
“They think, up at the school, that Hagrid’s been setting a — 
a — something on students. They’ve taken him to Azkaban.” 
Aragog clicked his pincers furiously, and all around the hol-
low the sound was echoed by the crowd of spiders; it was like applause, except applause didn’t usually make Harry feel sick with 
fear. 
“But that was years ago,” said Ar agog fretfully. “Years and years 
ago. I remember it well. That’s why they made him leave the 
school. They believed that I was the monster that dwells in what 
they call the Chamber of Secrets. They thought that Hagrid had 
opened the Chamber and set me free.” 
“And you . . . you didn’t come from the Chamber of Secrets?” 
said Harry, who could feel cold sweat on his forehead. 
“I!” said Aragog, clicking angrily. “I was not born in the castle. I 
come from a distant land. A travel er gave me to Hagrid when I was 
an egg. Hagrid was only a boy, but he cared for me, hidden in a 
cupboard in the castle, feeding me on scraps from the table. Hagrid 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 278  is my good friend, and a good man. When I was discovered, and 
blamed for the death of a girl, he protected me. I have lived here in 
the forest ever since, where Hagrid still visits me. He even found 
me a wife, Mosag, and you see how our family has grown, all through Hagrid’s goodness. . . .” 
Harry summoned what rema ined of his courage. 
“So you never — never attacked anyone?” “Never,” croaked the old spider. “It would have been my in-
stinct, but out of respect for Hagrid, I never harmed a human. The body of the girl who was killed was discover ed in a bathroom. I 
never saw any part of the castle but the cupboard in which I grew 
up. Our kind like the dark and the quiet. . . .” 
“But then . . . Do you know what did kill that girl?” said Harry. 
“Because whatever it is, it’s ba ck and attacking people again —” 
His words were drowned by a loud outbreak of clicking and the 
rustling of many long legs shif ting angrily; large black shapes 
shifted all around him. 
“The thing that lives in the cast le,” said Aragog, “is an ancient 
creature we spiders fear above a ll others. Well do I remember how 
I pleaded with Hagrid to let me go, when I sensed the beast mov-
ing about the school.” 
“What is it?” said Harry urgently. More loud clicking, more rustling ; the spiders seemed to be clos-
ing in. 
“We do not speak of it!” said Aragog fiercely. “We do not name 
it! I never even told Hagrid th e name of that dread creature, 
though he asked me, many times.” 
Harry didn’t want to press the subject, not with the spiders 
 
ARAGOG 
 279  pressing closer on all sides. Aragog seemed to be tired of talking. 
He was backing slowly into his domed web, but his fellow spiders 
continued to inch slowly toward Harry and Ron. 
“We’ll just go, then,” Harry ca lled desperately to Aragog, hear-
ing leaves rustli ng behind him. 
“Go?” said Aragog slowly. “I think not. . . .” 
“But — but —” 
“My sons and daughters do not harm Hagrid, on my command. 
But I cannot deny them fresh me at, when it wanders so willingly 
into our midst. Good-bye, friend of Hagrid.” 
Harry spun around. Feet away, towering above him, was a solid 
wall of spiders, clicking, their ma ny eyes gleaming in their ugly 
black heads. 
Even as he reached for his wa nd, Harry knew it was no good, 
there were too many of them, but as he tried to stand, ready to die 
fighting, a loud, long note sounde d, and a blaze of light flamed 
through the hollow. 
Mr. Weasley’s car was thundering down the slope, headlights 
glaring, its horn screeching, knocking spiders aside; several were 
thrown onto their backs, their endless legs waving in the air. The 
car screeched to a halt in fron t of Harry and Ron and the doors 
flew open. 
“Get Fang!” Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized 
the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the 
back of the car — the doors slammed shut — Ron didn’t touch the 
accelerator but the car didn’t need him; the engine roared and they 
were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the 
hollow, and they were soon crashi ng through the forest, branches 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 280  whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through 
the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew. 
Harry looked sideways at Ron. Hi s mouth was still open in the 
silent scream, but his eyes weren’t popping anymore. 
“Are you okay?” 
Ron stared straight ahea d, unable to speak. 
They smashed their way through the undergrowth, Fang howl-
ing loudly in the back seat, and Harry saw the side mirror snap off 
as they squeezed past a large oak. After ten noisy, rocky minutes, 
the trees thinned, and Harry co uld again see patches of sky. 
The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into 
the windshield. They had reached th e edge of the forest. Fang flung 
himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid’s house, 
tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still 
stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it re-
versed back into the forest and disappeared from view. 
Harry went back into Hagrid’s cabin to get the Invisibility 
Cloak. Fang was trembling under a blanket in his basket. When 
Harry got outside again, he found Ron being violently sick in the 
pumpkin patch. 
“Follow the spiders,” said Ron we akly, wiping his mouth on his 
sleeve. “I’ll never fo rgive Hagrid. We’re lucky to be alive.” 
“I bet he thought Aragog wouldn ’t hurt friends of his,” said 
Harry. 
“That’s exactly Hagrid’s problem! ” said Ron, thumping the wall 
of the cabin. “He always thinks monsters aren’t as bad as they’re 
 
ARAGOG 
 281  made out, and look where it’s go t him! A cell in Azkaban!” He was 
shivering uncontrollably now. “Wha t was the point of sending us 
in there? What have we foun d out, I’d like to know?” 
“That Hagrid never opened th e Chamber of Secrets,” said 
Harry, throwing the cloak over Ron and prodding him in the arm 
to make him walk. “He was innocent.” 
Ron gave a loud snort. Evidently, hatching Aragog in a cupboard 
wasn’t his idea of being innocent. 
As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make 
sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors 
ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up 
the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors 
where watchful sentries were wa lking. At last th ey reached the 
safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They t ook off the cloak and climbed the 
winding stair to their dormitory. 
Ron fell onto his bed without bothering to get undressed. Harry, 
however, didn’t feel very sleepy. He sat on the edge of his four-
poster, thinking hard about everything Aragog had said. 
The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he 
thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort — even other 
monsters didn ’t want to name it. But he and Ron were no closer to 
finding out what it was, or how it Petrified its victims. Even Hagrid 
had never known what was in the Chamber of Secrets. 
Harry swung his legs up onto his bed and leaned back against his 
pillows, watching the moon glinting at him through the tower window. 
He couldn’t see what else they co uld do. They had hit dead ends 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 282  everywhere. Riddle had caught th e wrong person, the Heir of 
Slytherin had got off, and no one co uld tell whether it was the same 
person, or a different one, who ha d opened the Chamber this time. 
There was nobody else to ask. Ha rry lay down, still thinking about 
what Aragog had said. 
He was becoming drowsy when what seemed like their very last 
hope occurred to him, and he suddenly sat bolt upright. 
“Ron,” he hissed through the dark, “Ron —” 
Ron woke with a yelp like Fang’s, stared wildly around, and saw 
Harry. 
“Ron — that girl who died. Ar agog said she was found in a 
bathroom,” said Harry, ignoring Ne ville’s snuffling snores from the 
corner. “What if she never left th e bathroom? What if she’s still 
there?” 
Ron rubbed his eyes, frowning through the moonlight. And 
then he understood, too. 
“You don’t think — not Moaning Myrtle ?” 
C H A P T E R S I X T E E N 
 
 283  THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 
 
ll those times we were in that bathroom, and she was just 
three toilets away,” said Ron bi tterly at breakfast next day, 
“and we could’ve asked her, and now . . .” 
It had been hard enou gh trying to look for spiders. Escaping 
their teachers long enough to sneak into a girls’ bathroom, the girls’ 
bathroom, moreover, right next to the scene of the first attack, was 
going to be almost impossible. 
But something happened in their first lesson, Transfiguration, 
that drove the Chamber of Secrets out of their minds for the first 
time in weeks. Ten minutes into the class, Professor McGonagall 
told them that their exams would start on the first of June, one 
week from today. 
“Exams ?” howled Seamus Finnigan. “We’re still getting exams ?” 
There was a loud bang behind Harry as Neville Longbottom’s 
wand slipped, vanishing one of the legs on his desk. Professor 
 A 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 284  McGonagall restored it with a wa ve of her own wand, and turned, 
frowning, to Seamus. 
“The whole point of keeping the school open at this time is for 
you to receive your education,” sh e said sternly. “The exams will 
therefore take place as usual, and I trust you are all studying hard.” 
Studying hard! It had never occurred to Harry that there would 
be exams with the castle in this state. There was a great deal of 
mutinous muttering around th e room, which made Professor 
McGonagall scowl ev en more darkly. 
“Professor Dumbledore’s instructions were to keep the school 
running as normally as possible,” sh e said. “And that, I need hardly 
point out, means finding out ho w much you have learned this 
year.” 
Harry looked down at the pair of white rabbits he was supposed 
to be turning into slippers. What had he learned so far this year? 
He couldn ’t seem to think of anything that would be useful in an exam. 
Ron looked as though he ’d just been told he had to go and live 
in the Forbidden Forest. 
“Can you imagine me taking exam s with this?” he asked Harry, 
holding up his wand, which had just started whistling loudly. 
 
Three days before their first exam , Professor McGonagall made an-
other announcement at breakfast. 
“I have good news,” she said, an d the Great Hall, instead of 
falling silent, erupted. 
“Dumbledore’s coming back!” se veral people yelled joyfully. 
“You’ve caught the Heir of Slyt herin!” squealed a girl at the 
Ravenclaw table. 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 285  “Quidditch matches are back on !” roared Wood excitedly. 
When the hubbub had subsided, Professor McGonagall said, 
“Professor Sprout has informed me that the Mandrakes are ready 
for cutting at last. Tonight, we wi ll be able to revive those people 
who have been Petrified. I need ha rdly remind you all that one of 
them may well be able to tell us wh o, or what, attacked them. I am 
h o p e f u l t h a t t h i s d r e a d f u l y e a r w i l l e n d w i t h o u r c a t c h i n g t h e c u l -
prit.” 
There was an explosion of cheering. Harry looked over at the 
Slytherin table and wasn’t at all su rprised to see that Draco Malfoy 
hadn’t joined in. Ron, however, was looking happier than he’d 
looked in days. 
“It won’t matter that we never asked Myrtle, then!” he said to 
Harry. “Hermione’ll probably have all the answers when they wake 
her up! Mind you, she’ll go crazy when she finds out we’ve got ex-ams in three days’ time. She hasn’t studied. It might be kinder to 
leave her where she is till they’r e over.” 
Just then, Ginny Weasley came over and sat down next to Ron. 
She looked tense and nervous, and Harry noticed that her hands 
were twisting in her lap. 
“What’s up?” said Ron, helpin g himself to more porridge. 
Ginny didn’t say anything, but glanced up and down the 
Gryffindor table with a scared l ook on her face that reminded 
Harry of someone, though he couldn’t think who. 
“Spit it out,” said Ron, watching her. 
Harry suddenly realized who Ginny looked like. She was rock-
ing backward and forward slightly in her chair, exactly like Dobby 
did when he was teetering on the edge of revealing forbidden in-
formation. 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 286  “I’ve got to tell you something, ” Ginny mumbled, carefully not 
looking at Harry. 
“What is it?” said Harry. 
Ginny looked as though she co uldn’t find the right words. 
“What ?” said Ron. 
Ginny opened her mouth, but no sound came out. Harry leaned 
forward and spoke quietly, so that only Ginny and Ron could hear 
him. 
“Is it something about the Chambe r of Secrets? Have you seen 
something? Someone acting oddly?” 
Ginny drew a deep breath and, at that precise moment, Percy 
Weasley appeared, looking tired and wan. 
“If you’ve finished eating, I’ll ta ke that seat, Ginny. I’m starving, 
I’ve only just come off patrol duty.” 
Ginny jumped up as though her chair had just been electrified, 
gave Percy a fleeting, frightened look, and scampered away. Percy sat down and grabbed a mug from the center of the table. 
“ P e r c y ! ” s a i d R o n a n g r i l y . “ S h e w a s j u s t a b o u t t o t e l l u s s o m e -
thing important!” 
Halfway through a gulp of tea, Percy choked. 
“What sort of thing?” he said, coughing. “I just asked her if she’d seen anything odd, and she started to 
say —” 
“Oh — that — that’s nothing to do with the Chamber of Se-
crets,” said Percy at once. 
“How do you know?” said Ro n, his eyebrows raised. 
“Well, er, if you must know, Gi nny, er, walked in on me the 
other day when I was — well, neve r mind — the point is, she spot- 
 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 287  ted me doing something and I, um , I asked her not to mention it 
to anybody. I must say, I did thin k she’d keep her word. It’s noth-
ing, really, I’d just rather —” 
Harry had never seen Percy look so uncomfortable. 
“What were you doing, Percy?” said Ron, grinning. “Go on, tell 
us, we won’t laugh.” 
Percy didn’t smile back. 
“Pass me those rolls, Harry, I’m starving.” 
 
Harry knew the whole mystery migh t be solved tomorrow without 
their help, but he wasn’t about to pass up a chance to speak to Myr-
tle if it turned up — and to his delight it did, midmorning, when 
they were being led to History of Magic by Gilderoy Lockhart. 
Lockhart, who had so often assu red them that all danger had 
passed, only to be proved wrong right away, was now wholeheart-edly convinced that it was hardly worth the trouble to see them safely down the corridor s . H i s h a i r w a s n ’ t a s s l e e k a s u s u a l ; i t 
seemed he had been up most of the night, patrolling the fourth 
floor. 
“Mark my words,” he said, usheri ng them around a corner. “The 
first words out of thos e poor Petrified people’s mouths will be ‘ It 
was Hagrid. ’ Frankly, I’m astounded Professor McGonagall thinks 
all these security meas ures are necessary.” 
“I agree, sir,” said Harry, making Ron drop his books in surprise. 
“Thank you, Harry,” said Lockhart graciously while they waited 
for a long line of Hufflepuffs to pass. “I mean, we teachers have 
quite enough to be getting on wi th, without walking students to 
classes and standing gu ard all night. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 288  “That’s right,” said Ron, catching on. “Why don’t you leave us 
here, sir, we’ve only got on e more corridor to go —” 
“You know, Weasley, I think I will,” said Lockhart. “I really 
should go and prepar e my next class —” 
And he hurried off. 
“Prepare his class,” Ron sneered after him. “Gone to curl his 
hair, more like.” 
They let the rest of the Gryffi ndors draw ahead of them, then 
darted down a side pa ssage and hurried off toward Moaning Myr-
tle’s bathroom. But just as they were congratulating each other on their brilliant scheme — 
“Potter! Weasley! What are you doing?” 
It was Professor McGonagall, an d her mouth was the thinnest of 
thin lines. 
“We were — we were —” Ron stammered. “We were going 
to — to go and see —” 
“Hermione,” said Harry. Ron an d Professor McGonagall both 
looked at him. 
“We haven’t seen her for ages, Professor,” Harry went on hur-
riedly, treading on Ron’s foot, “and we thought we’d sneak into the 
hospital wing, you know, and te ll her the Mandrakes are nearly 
ready and, er, not to worry —” 
Professor McGonagall was still staring at him, and for a mo-
ment, Harry thought she was going to explode, but when she 
spoke, it was in a strangely croaky voice. 
“Of course,” she said, and Harry, amazed, saw a tear glistening 
in her beady eye. “Of co urse, I realize this ha s all been hardest on 
the friends of those who have been . . . I quite understand. Yes, 
 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 289  Potter, of course you may visit Mi ss Granger. I will inform Profes-
sor Binns where you’ve gone. Tell Madam Pomfrey I have given my 
permission.” 
Harry and Ron walked away, hardly daring to believe that they’d 
avoided detention. As they turned the corner, they distinctly heard Professor McGonagall blow her nose. 
“That,” said Ron fervently, “was th e best story you’ve ever come 
up with.” 
They had no choice now but to go to the hospital wing and tell 
Madam Pomfrey that they had Professor McGonagall’s permission to visit Hermione. 
Madam Pomfrey let them in, but reluctantly. 
“There’s just no point talking to a Petrified person,” she said, and 
they had to admit she had a poin t when they’d taken their seats 
next to Hermione. It was plain that Hermione didn’t have the faint-
est inkling that she had visitors, and that they might just as well tell her bedside cabinet no t to worry for all the good it would do. 
“Wonder if she did see the attack er, though?” said Ron, looking 
sadly at Hermione’s rigid face. “Because if he sneaked up on them 
all, no one’ll ev er know. . . .” 
But Harry wasn’t looking at Hermione’s face. He was more in-
terested in her right hand. It lay clenched on top of her blankets, 
and bending closer, he saw that a piece of paper was scrunched in-
side her fist. 
Making sure that Madam Po mfrey was nowhere near, he 
pointed this out to Ron. 
“Try and get it out,” Ron whispered, shifting his chair so that he 
blocked Harry from Madam Pomfrey’s view. 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 290  It was no easy task. Hermione’s hand was clamped so tightly 
around the paper that Harry was sure he was going to tear it. While 
Ron kept watch he tugged and twis ted, and at last , after several 
tense minutes, the paper came free. 
It was a page torn from a ve ry old library book. Harry smoothed 
it out eagerly and Ron leaned close to read it, too. 
 
Of the many fearsome beasts and monsters that roam our land, 
there is none more curious or more deadly than the Basilisk, 
known also as the King of Serpents. This snake, which may 
reach gigantic size and live many hundreds of years, is born from a chicken’s egg, hatched beneath a toad. Its methods of killing are most wondrous, for aside from its deadly and ven-
omous fangs, the Basilisk has a murderous stare, and all who 
are fixed with the beam of its eye shall suffer instant death. 
Spiders flee before the Basilisk, for it is their mortal enemy, and the Basilisk flees only from the crowing of the rooster, which is fatal to it. 
 
And beneath this, a single word had been written, in a hand 
Harry recognized as Hermione’s. Pipes. 
It was as though some body had just flicked a light on in his 
brain. 
“Ron,” he breathed. “This is it. This is the answer. The monster 
in the Chamber’s a basilisk — a giant serpent! That’s why I’ve been 
hearing that voice all over the plac e, and nobody else has heard it. 
It’s because I understand Parseltongue. . . .” 
Harry looked up at th e beds around him. 
 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 291  “The basilisk kills people by looking at them. But no one’s 
died — because no one looked it st raight in the eye. Colin saw it 
through his camera. The basilisk burned up all the film inside it, 
but Colin just got Petrified. Justin . . . Justin must’ve seen the 
basilisk through Nearly Headless Nick! Nick got the full blast of it, 
but he couldn’t die again . . . and Hermione and that Ravenclaw 
prefect were found with a mirror next to them. Hermione had just 
realized the monster was a basili sk. I bet you anything she warned 
the first person she met to look ar ound corners with a mirror first! 
And that girl pulled out her mirror — and —” 
Ron’s jaw had dropped. “And Mrs. Norris?” he whispered eagerly. 
Harry thought hard, picturing th e scene on the night of Hal-
loween. 
“The water . . .” he said slowly. “The flood from Moaning Myr-
tle’s bathroom. I bet you Mrs. Norri s only saw the reflection. . . .” 
He scanned the page in his hand eagerly. The more he looked at 
it, the more it made sense. 
“. . . The crowing of the rooster . . . is fatal to it !” he read aloud. 
“Hagrid’s roosters were killed! Th e Heir of Slytherin didn’t want 
one anywhere near the castle once the Chamber was opened! Spi-
ders flee before it ! It all fits!” 
“But how’s the basilisk been gett ing around the place?” said Ron. 
“A giant snake . . . Someon e would’ve seen . . .” 
Harry, however, pointed at the word Hermione had scribbled at 
the foot of the page. 
“Pipes,” he said. “Pipes . . . Ro n, it’s been using the plumbing. 
I’ve been hearing that voice inside the walls. . . .” 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 292  Ron suddenly grab bed Harry’s arm. 
“The entrance to the Chamber of Secrets!” he said hoarsely. 
“What if it’s a bathroom ? What if it’s in —” 
“— Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom, ” said Harry. 
They sat there, excitement cour sing through them, hardly able 
to believe it. 
“This means,” said Harry, “I can’ t be the only Parselmouth in 
the school. The Heir of Slytherin’s one, too. That’s how he’s been 
controlling th e basilisk.” 
“What’re we going to do?” said Ron, whose eyes were flashing. 
“Should we go straig ht to McGonagall?” 
“Let’s go to the staffroom,” sa id Harry, jumping up. “She’ll be 
there in ten minutes. It’s nearly break.” 
They ran downstairs. Not wantin g to be discovered hanging 
around in another corridor, they went straight into the deserted staffroom. It was a large, paneled room full of dark, wooden chairs. Harry and Ron paced around it , too excited to sit down. 
But the bell to signal break never came. 
Instead, echoing through the corridors came Professor McGon-
agall’s voice, magically magnified. 
“All students to return to their House dormitories at once. All teach-
ers return to the staffroo m. Immediately, please. ” 
Harry wheeled around to stare at Ron. 
“Not another at tack? Not now?” 
“What’ll we do?” said Ron, aghast. “Go back to the dormitory?” 
“No,” said Harry, glancing around. There was an ugly sort of 
wardrobe to his left, full of the te achers’ cloaks. “In here. Let’s hear 
what it’s all about. Then we can tell them what we’ve found out.” 
 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 293  They hid themselves inside it, li stening to the rumbling of hun-
dreds of people moving overhead, and the staffroom door banging 
open. From between the musty folds of the cloaks, they watched the 
teachers filtering into the room. Some of them were looking puz-
zled, others downright scared. Then Professor McGonagall arrived. 
“It has happened,” she told the silent staffroom. “A student has 
been taken by the monster. Right into the Chamber itself.” 
Professor Flitwick let out a sque al. Professor Sprout clapped her 
hands over her mouth. Snape grippe d the back of a chair very hard 
and said, “How can you be sure?” 
“The Heir of Slytherin,” said Professor McGonagall, who was 
very white, “left another message. Right underneath the first one. 
‘Her skeleton will lie in the Chamber forever. ’” 
Professor Flitwick burst into tears. 
“Who is it?” said Madam Hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, 
into a chair. “Which student?” 
“Ginny Weasley,” said Professor McGonagall. Harry felt Ron slide silently dow n onto the wardrobe floor be-
side him. 
“We shall have to send all the students home tomorrow,” said 
Professor McGonagall. “This is the end of Hogwarts. Dumbledore 
always said . . .” 
The staffroom door banged open again. For one wild moment, 
Harry was sure it would be Dumbledore. But it was Lockhart, and he was beaming. 
“So sorry — dozed off — what have I missed?” 
He didn’t seem to notice that th e other teachers were looking at 
him with something remarkably like hatred. Snape stepped forward. 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 294  “Just the man,” he said. “The ve ry man. A girl has been snatched 
by the monster, Lockhart. Taken in to the Chamber of Secrets itself. 
Your moment has come at last.” 
Lockhart blanched. 
“That’s right, Gilderoy,” chippe d in Professor Sprout. “Weren’t 
you saying just last night that yo u’ve known all along where the en-
trance to the Chamber of Secrets is?” 
“I — well, I —” sputtered Lockhart. 
“Yes, didn’t you tell me you were sure you knew what was inside 
it?” piped up Professor Flitwick. 
“D-did I? I don ’t recall —” 
“I certainly remember you saying you were sorry you hadn’t had 
a crack at the monster before Hagr id was arrested,” said Snape. 
“Didn’t you say that the whole af fair had been bungled, and that 
you should have been given a free rein from the first?” 
Lockhart stared around at his stony-faced colleagues. “I — I really never — you may have misunderstood —” 
“We’ll leave it to you, then, Gi lderoy,” said Professor McGona-
gall. “Tonight will be an excellen t time to do it. We’ll make sure 
everyone’s out of your way. You’ll be able to tackle the monster all 
by yourself. A free rein at last.” 
Lockhart gazed desperately around him, but nobody came to the 
rescue. He didn’t look remotely handsome anymore. His lip was 
trembling, and in the absence of his usually toothy grin, he looked 
weak-chinned and feeble. 
“V-very well,” he said. “I’ll — I’ll be in my office, getting — 
getting ready.” 
And he left the room. 
“Right,” said Professor McGonaga ll, whose nostrils were flared, 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 295  “that’s got him out from under our feet. The Heads of Houses 
should go and inform their stud ents what has happened. Tell them 
the Hogwarts Express will take them home first thing tomorrow. 
Will the rest of you please make sure no students have been left 
outside their dormitories.” 
The teachers rose and left, one by one. 
 
It was probably the worst day of Harry’s entire life. He, Ron, Fred, 
and George sat together in a corner of the Gryffindor common 
room, unable to say anything to ea ch other. Percy wasn’t there. He 
had gone to send an owl to Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, then shut him-
self up in his dormitory. 
No afternoon ever lasted as long as that one, nor had Gryffindor 
Tower ever been so crowded, yet so quiet. Near sunset, Fred and 
George went up to bed, unable to sit there any longer. 
“She knew something, Harry,” said Ron, speaking for the first 
time since they had entered the wardrobe in the staffroom. “That’s why she was taken. It wasn’t some stupid thing about Percy at all. 
She’d found out something about the Chamber of Secrets. That 
must be why she was —” Ron rubbed his eyes frantically. “I mean, 
she was a pureblood. There ca n’t be any other reason.” 
Harry could see the sun sinking, blood-red, below the skyline. 
This was the worst he had ever fe lt. If only there was something 
they could do. Anything. 
“Harry,” said Ron. “D’you think there’s any chance at all she’s 
not — you know —” 
Harry didn’t know what to sa y. He couldn’t see how Ginny 
could still be alive. 
“ D ’ y o u k n o w w h a t ? ” s a i d R o n . “ I t h i n k w e s h o u l d g o a n d s e e 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 296  Lockhart. Tell him what we know. He’s going to try and get into 
the Chamber. We can tell him where we think it is, and tell him it’s 
a basilisk in there.” 
Because Harry couldn’t think of an ything else to do, and because 
h e w a n t e d t o b e d o i n g s o m e t h i n g, he agreed. The Gryffindors 
around them were so miserable, and felt so sorry for the Weasleys, 
that nobody tried to stop them as they got up, crossed the room, 
and left through th e portrait hole. 
Darkness was falling as they walk ed down to Lockhart’s office. 
There seemed to be a lot of activity going on inside it. They could 
hear scraping, thumps, and hurried footsteps. 
Harry knocked and there was a sudden silence from inside. 
Then the door opened the tiniest cr ack and they saw one of Lock-
hart’s eyes peering through it. 
“Oh — Mr. Potter — Mr. Weasle y —” he said, opening the 
door a bit wider. “I’m rather busy at the moment — if you would 
be quick —” 
“Professor, we’ve got some information for you,” said Harry. 
“We think it’ll help you.” 
“Er — well — it’s not terribly —” The side of Lockhart’s face 
that they could see looked very uncomfortable. “I mean — well — all right —” 
He opened the door and they entered. 
His office had been almost completely stripped. Two large 
trunks stood open on the floor. Robe s, jade-green, lilac, midnight-
blue, had been hastily folded into one of them; books were jum-bled untidily into the other. Th e photographs that had covered the 
walls were now crammed in to boxes on the desk. 
 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 297  “Are you going somewhere?” said Harry. 
“Er, well, yes,” said Lockhart, ripp ing a life-size poster of himself 
from the back of the door as he spoke and starting to roll it up. 
“Urgent call — unavoidable — got to go —” 
“What about my sister?” said Ron jerkily. “Well, as to that — most unfo rtunate —” said Lockhart, avoid-
ing their eyes as he wrenched open a drawer and started emptying 
the contents into a bag. “No one regrets more than I —” 
“You’re the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher!” said Harry. 
“You can’t go now! Not with all the Dark stuff going on here!” 
“Well — I must say — when I t ook the job —” Lockhart mut-
tered, now piling socks on top of his robes. “nothing in the job de-
scription — didn’t expect —” 
“You mean you’re running away ? said Harry disbelievingly. “Af-
ter all that stuff you did in your books —” 
“Books can be misleading,” said Lockhart delicately. 
“You wrote them!” Harry shouted. 
“My dear boy,” said Lockhart, straightening up and frowning at 
Harry. “Do use your common sense. My books wouldn’t have sold 
half as well if people didn’t think I’d done all those things. No one 
wants to read about some ugly old Armenian warlock, even if he 
did save a village from werewolves. He’d look dreadful on the front 
cover. No dress sense at all. An d the witch who banished the Ban-
don Banshee had a hairy chin. I mean, come on —” 
“So you’ve just been taking credit for what a load of other people 
have done?” said Ha rry incredulously. 
“Harry, Harry,” said Lockhart, shaking his head impatiently, 
“it’s not nearly as simple as that. There was work involved. I had 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 298  to track these people down. Ask them exactly how they managed 
to do what they did. Then I had to put a Memory Charm on 
them so they wouldn’t remember doing it. If there’s one thing I 
pride myself on, it’s my Memory Charms. No, it’s been a lot of 
work, Harry. It’s not all book si gnings and publicity photos, you 
know. You want fame, you have to be prepared for a long hard 
slog.” 
He banged the lids of his tr unks shut and locked them. 
“Let’s see,” he said. “I think that’s everything. Yes. Only one 
thing left.” 
He pulled out his wand and turned to them. “Awfully sorry, boys, but I’ll have to put a Memory Charm on 
you now. Can’t have you blabbing my secrets all over the place. I’d never sell another book —” 
Harry reached his wand just in time. Lockhart had barely raised 
his, when Harry bellowed, “ Expelliarmus !” 
Lockhart was blasted backward, fa lling over his trunk; his wand 
flew high into the air; Ron caught it, and flung it out of the open 
window. 
“Shouldn’t have let Professor Snape teach us that one,” said 
Harry furiously, kicking Lockhart’s trunk aside. Lockhart was look-
ing up at him, feeble once more. Harry was still pointing his wand 
at him. 
“What d’you want me to do?” sa id Lockhart weakly. “I don’t 
know where the Chamber of Secret s is. There’s nothing I can do.” 
“You’re in luck,” said Harry, fo rcing Lockhart to his feet at 
wandpoint. “We think we know where it is. And w h a t ’ s i n s i d e i t . 
Let’s go.” 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 299  They marched Lockhart out of his office and down the nearest 
stairs, along the dark corridor where the messages shone on the 
wall, to the door of Moan ing Myrtle’s bathroom. 
They sent Lockhart in first. Harry was pleased to see that he was 
shaking. 
Moaning Myrtle was si tting on the tank of the end toilet. 
“Oh, it’s you,” she said when she saw Harry. “What do you want 
this time?” 
“To ask you how you died,” said Harry. 
Myrtle’s whole aspect changed at once. She looked as though she 
had never been asked such a flattering question. 
“Ooooh, it was dreadf ul,” she said with relish. “It happened 
right in here. I died in this very stall. I remember it so well. I’d hid-
den because Olive Hornby was teasing me about my glasses. The 
door was locked, and I was crying , and then I heard somebody 
come in. They said something funny. A different language, I think 
it must have been. Anyway, what really got me was that it was a boy 
speaking. So I unlocked the door, to tell him to go and use his own 
toilet, and then —” Myrtle swelle d importantly, her face shining. 
“I died.” 
“How?” said Harry. 
“No idea,” said Myrtle in hushed tones. “I just remember seeing 
a pair of great, big, yellow eyes. My whole body sort of seized up, 
and then I was floating away. . . .” She looked dreamily at Harry. 
“And then I came back again. I was determined to haunt Olive 
Hornby, you see. Oh, she was so rry she’d ever laughed at my 
glasses.” 
“Where exactly did you see the eyes?” said Harry. 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 300  “Somewhere there,” said Myrtle , pointing vaguely toward the 
sink in front of her toilet. 
Harry and Ron hurried over to it . Lockhart was standing well 
back, a look of utte r terror on his face. 
It looked like an or dinary sink. They examined every inch of it, 
inside and out, including the pipes below. And then Harry saw it: 
Scratched on the side of one of the copper taps was a tiny snake. 
“That tap’s never worked,” said My rtle brightly as he tried to 
turn it. 
“Harry,” said Ron. “S ay something. Something in Parseltongue.” 
“But —” Harry thought hard. Th e only times he’d ever man-
aged to speak Parseltong ue were when he’d be en faced with a real 
snake. He stared hard at the tiny engraving, trying to imagine it 
was real. 
“Open up,” he said. He looked at Ron, who shook his head. 
“English,” he said. 
Harry looked back at the snake, wi lling himself to believe it was 
alive. If he moved his head, the candlelight made it look as though 
it were moving. 
“Open up,” he said. 
Except that the words weren’t wh at he heard; a strange hissing 
had escaped him, and at once the ta p glowed with a brilliant white 
light and began to spin. Next seco nd, the sink began to move; the 
sink, in fact, sank, righ t out of sight, leaving a large pipe exposed, a 
pipe wide enough for a man to slide into. 
Harry heard Ron gasp and looked up again. He had made up his 
mind what he was going to do. 
 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 301  “I’m going down there,” he said. 
He couldn’t not go, not now they had found the entrance to the 
Chamber, not if there was even the faintest, slimmest, wildest 
chance that Ginny might be alive. 
“Me too,” said Ron. 
There was a pause. “Well, you hardly seem to need me,” said Lockhart, with a 
shadow of his old sm ile. “I’ll just —” 
He put his hand on the door knob, but Ron and Harry both 
pointed their wands at him. 
“You can go first,” Ron snarled. White-faced and wandless, Lockhart approached the opening. 
“Boys,” he said, his voice feeble. “Boys, what good will it do?” 
Harry jabbed him in the back with his wand. Lockhart slid his 
legs into the pipe. 
“I really don’t think —” he star ted to say, but Ron gave him a 
push, and he slid out of sight. Harry followed quickly. He lowered 
himself slowly into the pipe, then let go. 
It was like rushing down an endless, slimy, dark slide. He could 
see more pipes branching off in al l directions, but none as large as 
theirs, which twisted and turned, sloping steeply downward, and 
he knew that he was falling deep er below the school than even the 
dungeons. Behind him he could hear Ron, thudding slightly at the 
curves. 
And then, just as he had begu n to worry about what would hap-
pen when he hit the ground, the pi pe leveled out, and he shot out 
of the end with a wet thud, landin g on the damp floor of a dark 
stone tunnel large enough to stand in. Lockhart was getting to his 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 302  feet a little ways away, covered in slime and white as a ghost. Harry 
stood aside as Ron came whizzi ng out of the pipe, too. 
“We must be miles unde r the school,” said Harry, his voice echo-
ing in the black tunnel. 
“Under the lake, probably,” said Ron, squinting around at the 
dark, slimy walls. 
All three of them turned to st are into the darkness ahead. 
“Lumos !” Harry muttered to his wand and it lit again. “C’mon,” 
he said to Ron and Lockhart, an d off they went, their footsteps 
slapping loudly on the wet floor. 
The tunnel was so dark that they could only see a little distance 
ahead. Their shadows on the wet walls looked monstrous in the 
wandlight. 
“Remember,” Harry said quietly as they walked cautiously for-
ward, “any sign of movement, close your eyes right away. . . .” 
But the tunnel was quiet as the gr ave, and the first unexpected 
sound they heard was a loud crunch as Ron stepped on what turned 
out to be a rat’s skull. Harry lowere d his wand to look at the floor 
and saw that it was littered with small animal bones. Trying very 
hard not to imagine what Ginny might look like if they found her, 
Harry led the way forward, around a dark bend in the tunnel. 
“Harry — there’s something up there —” said Ron hoarsely, 
grabbing Harry’s shoulder. 
They froze, watching. Harry could just see the outline of some-
thing huge and curved, lying right across the tunnel. It wasn’t mov-
ing. 
“Maybe it’s asleep,” he breathed, glancing back at the other two. 
Lockhart’s hands were pressed over his eyes. Harry tu rned back to 
look at the thing, his hear t beating so fast it hurt. 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 303  Very slowly, his eyes as narrow as he could make them and still 
see, Harry edged forward, his wand held high. 
The light slid over a gigantic sn ake skin, of a vivid, poisonous 
green, lying curled and empty across the tunnel floor. The creature 
that had shed it must have been twenty feet long at least. 
“Blimey,” said Ron weakly. 
There was a sudden movement behind them. Gilderoy Lock-
hart’s knees had given way. 
“Get up,” said Ron sharply, po inting his wand at Lockhart. 
Lockhart got to his feet — then he dived at Ron, knocking him 
to the ground. 
Harry jumped forward, but too la te — Lockhart was straighten-
ing up, panting, Ron’s wand in his hand and a gleaming smile back on his face. 
“The adventure ends here, boys!” he said. “I shall take a bit of 
this skin back up to the school, tell them I was too late to save the girl, and that you two tragically lost your minds at the sight of her 
mangled body — say good-by e to your memories!” 
He raised Ron’s Spellotaped wand high over his head and yelled, 
“Obliviate !” 
The wand exploded with the forc e of a small bomb. Harry flung 
his arms over his head and ran, sli pping over the coils of snake skin, 
out of the way of great chunks of tunnel ceiling that were thunder-
ing to the floor. Next moment, he was standing alone, gazing at a solid wall of broken rock. 
“Ron!” he shouted. “Are you okay? Ron!” “I’m here!” came Ron’s muffled voice from behind the rock-
fall. “I’m okay — this git’s not, though — he got blasted by the 
wand —” 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 304  There was a dull thud and a loud “ow!” It sounded as though 
Ron had just kicked Lockhart in the shins. 
“What now?” Ron’s voice said, so unding desperate. “We can’t 
get through — it’ll take ages. . . .” 
Harry looked up at the tunnel ceiling. Huge cracks had ap-
peared in it. He had never tried to break apart anything as large as 
these rocks by magic, and now di dn’t seem a good moment to 
try — what if the wh ole tunnel caved in? 
There was another thud and another “ow!” from behind the 
rocks. They were wasting time . Ginny had already been in the 
Chamber of Secrets for hours. . . . Harry knew there was only one 
thing to do. 
“Wait there,” he called to Ron. “Wait with Lockhart. I’ll go 
on. . . . If I’m not back in an hour . . .” 
There was a very pregnant pause. “I’ll try and shift some of this rock,” said Ron, who seemed to 
be trying to keep his voice steady. “So you can — can get back 
through. And, Harry —” 
“See you in a bit,” said Harry, tr ying to inject some confidence 
into his shaking voice. 
And he set off alone past the giant snake skin. 
Soon the distant noise of Ron straining to shift the rocks was 
gone. The tunnel turned and turned again. Every nerve in Harry’s 
body was tingling unpleasantly. He wanted the tunnel to end, yet 
dreaded what he’d find when it did. And then, at last, as he crept 
around yet another bend, he saw a solid wall ahead on which two 
entwined serpents were carved, their eyes set with great, glinting 
emeralds. 
THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS 
 305  Harry approached, his throat very dry. There was no need to 
pretend these stone snakes were real; their eyes looked strangely 
alive. 
He could guess what he had to do. He cleared his throat, and the 
emerald eyes seemed to flicker. 
“Open, ” said Harry, in a low, faint hiss. 
The serpents parted as the wall cracked open, the halves slid 
smoothly out of sight, and Harr y , s h a k i n g f r o m h e a d t o f o o t , 
walked inside. 
C H A P T E R S E V E N T E E N 
 
 306  THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 
 
 
e was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit cham-
ber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved 
serpents rose to support a ceilin g lost in darkness, casting long, 
black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place. 
His heart beating very fast, Harry stood listening to the chill si-
lence. Could the basilisk be lurk ing in a shadowy corner, behind a 
pillar? And where was Ginny? 
He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the ser-
pentine columns. Every careful f ootstep echoed loudly off the 
shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them 
shut at the smallest sign of mo vement. The hollow eye sockets of 
the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with 
a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir. 
Then, as he drew level wi th the last pair of pillars, a statue high as 
the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall. 
 H 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 307  Harry had to crane his nec k to look up into th e giant face above: 
It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell al-
most to the bottom of the wizard ’s sweeping stone robes, where 
two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And 
between the feet, facedow n, lay a small, blac k-robed figure with 
flaming-red hair. 
“Ginny !” Harry muttered, sprinting to her and dropping to his 
knees. “Ginny — don’t be dead — please don’t be dead —” He 
flung his wand aside, grabbed Ginny’s shoulders, and turned her 
over. Her face was white as marble, and as cold, yet her eyes were 
closed, so she wasn’t Petrifie d. But then she must be — 
“Ginny, please wake up,” Harry muttered desperately, shaking 
her. Ginny’s head lolled hopelessly from side to side. 
“She won’t wake,” sa id a soft voice. 
Harry jumped and spun around on his knees. 
A tall, black-haired boy was lean ing against the nearest pillar, 
watching. He was strangely blurred around the edges, as though 
Harry were looking at him thro ugh a misted window. But there 
was no mistaking him — 
“Tom — Tom Riddle ?” 
Riddle nodded, not taking his eyes off Harry’s face. 
“What d’you mean, she won’t wake?” Harry said desperately. 
“She’s not — she’s not — ?” 
“She’s still alive,” said Riddle. “But only just.” Harry stared at him. Tom Riddle had been at Hogwarts fifty 
years ago, yet here he stood, a weird, misty light shining about him, not a day older than sixteen. 
“Are you a ghost?” Har ry said uncertainly. 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 308  “A memory,” said Riddle quietly. “Preserved in a diary for fifty 
years.” 
He pointed toward the floor near the statue’s giant toes. Lying 
open there was the little black diary Harry had found in Moaning 
Myrtle’s bathroom. For a second , Harry wondered how it had got 
there — but there were more pr essing matters to deal with. 
“You’ve got to help me, Tom,” Harry said, raising Ginny’s head 
again. “We’ve got to get her out of here. There’s a basilisk . . . I 
don’t know where it is, but it could be along any moment. . . . 
Please, help me —” 
Riddle didn’t move. Harry, swea ting, managed to hoist Ginny 
half off the floor, and bent to pick up his wand again. 
But his wand had gone. 
“Did you see — ?” 
He looked up. Riddle was still watching him — twirling Harry’s 
wand between his long fingers. 
“Thanks,” said Harry, stretc hing out his hand for it. 
A smile curled the corners of Riddle’s mouth. He continued to 
stare at Harry, twirling the wand idly. 
“Listen,” said Harry urgently, his knees sagging with Ginny’s 
dead weight. “ We’ve got to go ! If the basilisk comes —” 
“It won’t come until it is ca lled,” said Riddle calmly. 
Harry lowered Ginny back onto the floor, unable to hold her up 
any longer. 
“What d’you mean?” he said. “Look, give me my wand, I might 
need it —” 
Riddle’s smile broadened. 
“You won’t be needing it,” he said. 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 309  Harry stared at him. 
“What d’you mean, I won’t be — ?” 
“I’ve waited a long time for this , Harry Potter,” said Riddle. “For 
the chance to see you. To speak to you.” 
“Look,” said Harry, losing patience, “I don’t think you get it. 
We’re in the Chamber of Secrets. We can talk later —” 
“We’re going to talk now,” said Riddle, still smiling broadly, and 
he pocketed Harry’s wand. 
Harry stared at him. There was something very funny going on 
here. . . . 
“How did Ginny get like this?” he asked slowly. “Well, that’s an interesting qu estion,” said Riddle pleasantly. 
“And quite a long story. I suppose the real reason Ginny Weasley’s like this is because she opened he r heart and spille d all her secrets 
to an invisible stranger.” 
“What are you talking about?” said Harry. “The diary,” said Riddle. “ My diary. Little Ginny’s been writing 
in it for months and months, tell ing me all her pitiful worries and 
woes — how her brothers tease her, how she had to come to school 
with secondhand robes and books, how” — Riddle’s eyes glinted — 
“how she didn’t think famous , good, great Harry Potter would ever 
like her. . . .” 
All the time he spoke, Riddle’s ey es never left Harry’s face. There 
was an almost hung ry look in them. 
“It’s very boring, having to listen to the silly little troubles of an 
eleven-year-old girl,” he went on. “But I was patient. I wrote back. 
I was sympathetic, I was kind. Ginny simply loved me. No one’s ever 
understood me like you, Tom. . . . I’m so glad I’ve got this diary to 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 310  confide in. . . . I t ’ s l i k e h a v i n g a f r i e n d I c a n c a r r y a r o u n d i n m y 
pocket. . . .” 
Riddle laughed, a high, cold laugh that didn ’t suit him. It made 
the hairs stand up on th e back of Harry’s neck. 
“If I say it myself, Harry, I’ve always been able to charm the 
people I needed. So Ginny poured out her soul to me, and her soul 
happened to be exactly what I wanted. . . . I grew stronger and 
stronger on a diet of her deepest fears, her darkest secrets. I grew 
powerful, far more powerful than little Miss Weasley. Powerful 
enough to start feeding Miss Weasley a few of my secrets, to start 
pouring a little of my soul back into her . . .” 
“What d’you mean?” said Harry, whose mouth had gone very 
dry. 
“Haven’t you guessed yet, Harry Potter?” said Riddle softly. 
“Ginny Weasley opened the Chamber of Secrets. She strangled the 
school roosters and daubed threat ening messages on the walls. She 
set the Serpent of Slytherin on four Mudbloods, and the Squib’s 
cat.” 
“No,” Harry whispered. 
“Yes,” said Riddle, calmly . “Of course, she didn’t know what she 
was doing at first. It was very amusing. I wish you could have seen 
her new diary entries . . . far more interesting, they became. . . . 
Dear Tom,” he recited, watching Harry’s horrified face, “ I think I’m 
losing my memory. There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I 
don’t know how they got there. Dear Tom, I can’t remember what I did 
on the night of Hallowee n, but a cat wa s attacked and I’ve got paint 
all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I’m pale and I’m 
not myself. I think he suspects me. . . . There was another attack today 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 311  and I don’t know where I was. Tom, what am I going to do? I think 
I’m going mad . . . . I think I’m the one attacking everyone, Tom !” 
Harry’s fists were clenched, th e nails digging deep into his 
palms. 
“It took a very long time for stupid little Ginny to stop trusting 
her diary,” said Riddle. “But sh e finally became suspicious and 
tried to dispose of it. And that’s where you came in, Harry. You 
found it, and I couldn’t have been more delighted. Of all the people 
who could have picked it up, it was you, the very person I was most 
anxious to meet. . . .” 
“And why did you want to meet me?” said Harry. Anger was 
coursing through him, and it was an effort to keep his voice steady. 
“Well, you see, Ginny told me all about you, Harry,” said Rid-
dle. “Your whole fascinating history.” His eyes roved over the light-
ning scar on Harry’s forehead, an d their expression grew hungrier. 
“I knew I must find out more about you, talk to you, meet you if I could. So I decided to show you my famous capture of that great 
oaf, Hagrid, to gain your trust —” 
“Hagrid’s my friend,” said Harry, his voice now shaking. “And 
you framed him, didn’t you? I thought you made a mistake, but —” 
Riddle laughed his high laugh again. 
“It was my word agai nst Hagrid’s, Harry. Well, you can imagine 
how it looked to old Armando Dippet. On the one hand, Tom 
Riddle, poor but brilliant, parentless but so brave, school prefect, 
model student . . . on the other ha nd, big, blundering Hagrid, in 
trouble every other week, trying to raise werewolf cubs under his 
bed, sneaking off to the Forbidden Fo rest to wrestle trolls . . . but I 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 312  admit, even I was surprised how well th e plan worked. I thought 
someone must realize that Hagrid couldn’t possibly be the Heir of 
Slytherin. It had taken me five whole years to find out everything I 
could about the Chambe r of Secrets and disc over the secret en-
trance . . . as though Hagrid had the brains, or the power! 
“Only the Transfiguration teac her, Dumbledore, seemed to 
think Hagrid was innocent. He pe rsuaded Dippet to keep Hagrid 
and train him as gamekeeper. Yes, I think Dumbledore might have 
guessed. . . . Dumbledore never seemed to like me as much as the 
other teachers did. . . .” 
“I bet Dumbledore saw right thro ugh you,” said Harry, his teeth 
gritted. 
“Well, he certainly kept an anno yingly close watch on me after 
Hagrid was expelled,” said Riddle ca relessly. “I knew it wouldn’t be 
safe to open the Chamber again whil e I was still at school. But I 
wasn’t going to waste those long years I’d spent searching for it. I 
decided to leave behind a diary, pr eserving my sixteen-year-old self 
in its pages, so that one day, with luck, I would be able to lead an-
other in my footsteps, and finish Salazar Slytherin’s noble work.” 
“Well, you haven’t finished it ,” said Harry triumphantly. “No 
one’s died this time, not even the cat. In a few hours the Mandrake 
Draught will be ready and everyone who was Petrified will be all 
right again —” 
“Haven’t I already told you,” said Riddle quietly, “that killing 
Mudbloods doesn’t matter to me an ymore? For many months now, 
my new target has been — you.” 
Harry stared at him. 
“Imagine how angry I was when the next time my diary was 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 313  opened, it was Ginny who was writin g to me, not you. She saw you 
with the diary, you see, and pani cked. What if you found out how 
to work it, and I repeated all he r secrets to you? What if, even 
worse, I told you who’d been strang ling roosters? So the foolish lit-
tle brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. 
But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin’s heir. From everything Ginny had told me about 
you, I knew you would go to an y lengths to solve the mystery — 
particularly if one of y o u r b e s t f r i e n d s w a s attacked. And Ginny 
had told me the whole school wa s buzzing because you could speak 
Parseltongue. . . . 
“So I made Ginny write her own farewell on the wall and come 
down here to wait. She struggled and cried and became very boring. 
But there isn’t much life left in her. . . . She put too much into the diary, into me. Enough to let me leave its pages at last. . . . I 
have been waiting for you to appear since we arrived here. I knew 
you’d come. I have many questions for you, Harry Potter.” 
“Like what?” Harry spat , fists still clenched. 
“Well,” said Riddle, smiling pleasantly, “how is it that you — 
a skinny boy with no extraord inary magical talent — managed 
to defeat the greatest wiza rd of all time? How did you escape 
with nothing but a scar, while Lo rd Voldemort’s powers were de-
stroyed?” 
There was an odd red gleam in his hungry eyes now. 
“Why do you care how I escaped?” said Harry slowly. “Volde-
mort was after yo ur time. . . .” 
“Voldemort,” said Riddle softly, “is my past, present, and future, 
Harry Potter. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 314  He pulled Harry’s wand from his pocket and began to trace it 
through the air, writing three shimmering words: 
tom marvolo riddle 
Then he waved the wand once, an d the letters of his name re-
arranged themselves: 
i am lord voldemort 
“You see?” he whispered. “It wa s a name I was already using at 
Hogwarts, to my most intimate friends only, of course. You think I 
was going to use my filthy Muggle father’s name forever? I, in 
whose veins runs the blood of Salazar Slythe rin himself, through 
my mother’s side? I, keep the name of a foul, common Muggle, 
who abandoned me even before I was born, just because he found out his wife was a witch? No, Harry — I fashioned myself a new 
name, a name I knew wizards everywhere would one day fear to speak, when I had become the gr eatest sorcerer in the world!” 
Harry’s brain seemed to have jamme d. He stared numbly at Rid-
dle, at the orphaned boy who had grown up to murder Harry’s own 
parents, and so many others. . . . At last he forced himself to speak. 
“You’re not,” he said, his quiet voice full of hatred. “Not what?” snapped Riddle. “Not the greatest sorcerer in the world,” said Harry, breathing 
fast. “Sorry to disappo int you and all that, bu t the greatest wizard 
in the world is Albus Dumbledore. Everyone says so. Even when 
you were strong, you didn’t dare try and take over at Hogwarts. 
Dumbledore saw through you when yo u were at school and he still 
frightens you now, wherever yo u’re hiding these days —” 
The smile had gone from Riddle’s fa ce, to be replaced by a very 
ugly look. 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 315  “Dumbledore’s been driven out of this castle by the mere mem-
ory of me!” he hissed. 
“He’s not as gone as you might think!” Harry retorted. He was 
speaking at random, wanting to sc are Riddle, wishing rather than 
believing it to be true — 
Riddle opened his mouth, but froze. 
Music was coming from somewhere. Riddle whirled around to 
stare down the empty Chamber. Th e music was growing louder. It 
was eerie, spine-tingling, unearthly; it lifted the hair on Harry’s 
scalp and made his heart feel as thou gh it was swelling to twice its 
normal size. Then, as the music re ached such a pitch that Harry felt 
it vibrating inside his own ribs, flames erupted at the top of the 
nearest pillar. 
A crimson bird the size of a swan had appeared, piping its weird 
music to the vaulted ceil ing. It had a glittering golden tail as long 
as a peacock’s and gleaming golden talons, which were gripping a 
ragged bundle. 
A second later, the bird was flyi ng straight at Harry. It dropped 
the ragged thing it was carrying at his feet, then landed heavily on 
his shoulder. As it folded its grea t wings, Harry looked up and saw 
it had a long, sharp golden beak and a beady black eye. 
The bird stopped singing. It sa t still and warm next to Harry’s 
cheek, gazing stea dily at Riddle. 
“That’s a phoenix. . . .” said Riddle, staring shrewdly back at it. 
“Fawkes ?” Harry breathed, and he fe lt the bird’s golden claws 
squeeze his shoulder gently. 
“And that —” said Riddle, now eyei ng the ragged thing that 
Fawkes had drop ped, “that’s the old sc hool Sorting Hat —” 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 316  So it was. Patched, frayed, and dirty, the hat lay motionless at 
Harry’s feet. 
Riddle began to laugh again. He laughed so hard that the dark 
Chamber rang with it, as though ten Riddles were laughing at 
once — 
“This is what Dumbledore sends his defender! A songbird and an 
old hat! Do you feel brave, Harry Potter? Do you feel safe now?” 
Harry didn’t answer. He might not see what use Fawkes or the 
Sorting Hat were, but he was no lo nger alone, and he waited for 
Riddle to stop laughing with his courage mounting. 
“To business, Harry,” said Ri ddle, still smiling broadly. 
“Twice — in your past, in my future — we have met. And twice I 
failed to kill you. How did you survive ? Tell me everything. The 
longer you talk,” he added softly, “the longer you stay alive.” 
Harry was thinking fast, weighin g his chances. Riddle had the 
wand. He, Harry, had Fawkes and th e Sorting Hat, neither of which 
would be much good in a duel. It l ooked bad, all right . . . but the 
longer Riddle stood there, the mo re life was dwindling out of 
Ginny . . . and in the meantime, Harry noticed suddenly, Riddle’s 
outline was becoming clearer, more solid. . . . If it had to be a fight 
between him and Ri ddle, better soon er than later. 
“No one knows why you lost yo ur powers when you attacked 
me,” said Harry abruptly. “I don’t know myself. But I know why 
you couldn’t kill me. Because my mother died to save me. My com-
mon Muggle-born mother,” he added, shak ing with suppressed rage. 
“She stopped you killin g me. And I’ve seen th e real you, I saw you 
last year. You’re a wreck. You’re ba rely alive. That’s where all your 
power got you. You’re in hiding. You’re ugly, you’re foul —” 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 317  Riddle’s face contorted. Then he forced it into an awful smile. 
“So. Your mother died to save you. Yes, that’s a powerful counter-
charm. I can see now . . . there is nothing special about you, after 
all. I wondered, you see. There are strange likenesses between us, after all. Even you must have noticed. Both half-bloods, orphans, 
raised by Muggles. Probably the on ly two Parselmouths to come to 
Hogwarts since the great Sl ytherin himself. We even look something 
alike . . . but after all, it was me rely a lucky chance that saved you 
from me. That’s all I wanted to know.” 
Harry stood, tense, waiting for Riddle to raise his wand. But Rid-
dle’s twisted smile wa s widening again. 
“Now, Harry, I’m going to teach you a little lesson. Let’s match 
the powers of Lord Voldemort, Heir of Salazar Slytherin, against fa-mous Harry Potter, and the best weapons Dumbledore can give 
him. . . .” 
He cast an amused eye over Fawkes and the Sorting Hat, then 
walked away. Harry, fear spreadin g up his numb legs, watched Rid-
dle stop between the high pillars and look up into the stone face of 
Slytherin, high above him in th e half-darkness. Riddle opened his 
mouth wide and hissed — but Harry understood what he was say-
ing. . . . 
“Speak to me, Slytherin, greatest of the Hogwarts Four. ” 
Harry wheeled around to look up at the statue, Fawkes swaying 
on his shoulder. 
Slytherin’s gigantic stone face was moving. Horrorstruck, Harry 
saw his mouth opening, wider and wider, to make a huge black hole. 
And something was stirring inside the statue’s mouth. Something 
was slithering up from its depths. 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 318  Harry backed away until he hit th e dark Chamber wall, and as he 
shut his eyes tight he felt Fawkes’ wing sweep his cheek as he took 
flight. Harry wanted to shout, “D on’t leave me!” but what chance 
did a phoenix have agains t the king of serpents? 
Something huge hit the stone floor of the Chamber. Harry felt it 
shudder — he knew what was happening, he could sense it, could 
almost see the giant serpent uncoilin g itself from Slytherin’s mouth. 
Then he heard Riddle ’s hissing voice: 
“Kill him. ” 
The basilisk was moving toward Harry; he could hear its heavy 
body slithering heavily across the du sty floor. Eyes still tightly shut, 
Harry began to run blin dly sideways, his hand s outstretched, feel-
ing his way — Voldemort was laughing — 
Harry tripped. He fell hard onto the stone and tasted blood — 
the serpent was barely feet from him, he could hear it coming — 
There was a loud, explosive spit ting sound right above him, and 
then something heavy hit Harry so hard that he was smashed into 
the wall. Waiting for fangs to sink through his body he heard more 
mad hissing, something thrash ing wildly off the pillars — 
He couldn’t help it — he opened his eyes wide enough to squint 
at what was going on. 
The enormous serpent, bright, poisonous green, thick as an oak 
trunk, had raised itself high in th e air and its great blunt head was 
weaving drunkenly between the pilla rs. As Harry trembled, ready to 
close his eyes if it turned, he sa w what had distra cted the snake. 
Fawkes was soaring around its head , and the basilisk was snapping 
furiously at him with fangs long and thin as sabers — 
Fawkes dived. His long golden be ak sank out of sight and a 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 319  sudden shower of dark blood spatte red the floor. The snake’s tail 
thrashed, narrowly missing Harry, and before Harry could shut his 
eyes, it turned — Harry looked straig ht into its face and saw that its 
eyes, both its great, bulbous yellow eyes, had been punctured by the 
phoenix; blood was streaming to th e floor, and the snake was spitting 
in agony. 
“NO!” Harry heard Riddle screaming. “ LEAVE THE BIRD! 
LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND YOU! YOU CAN 
STILL SMELL HIM! KILL HIM!” 
The blinded serpent swayed, confused, still deadly. Fawkes was 
circling its head, piping his eerie song, jabbing here and there at its 
scaly nose as the blood pour ed from its ruined eyes. 
“Help me, help me,” Harry mu ttered wildly, “someone — any-
one —” 
The snake’s tail whipped across the floor again. Harry ducked. 
Something soft hit his face. 
The basilisk had swept the Sort ing Hat into Harry’s arms. Harry 
seized it. It was all he had left, his only chance — he rammed it onto 
his head and threw himself flat onto the floor as the basilisk’s tail 
swung over him again. 
Help me — help me — Harry thought, his eyes screwed tight un-
der the hat. Please help me — 
There was no answering voice. In stead, the hat contracted, as 
though an invisible hand was squeezing it very tightly. 
Something very hard and heavy th udded onto the top of Harry’s 
head, almost knocking him out. Star s winking in front of his eyes, he 
grabbed the top of the hat to pull it off and felt something long and 
hard beneath it. 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 320  A gleaming silver sword had appear ed inside the hat, its handle 
glittering with rubies the size of eggs. 
“KILL THE BOY! LEAVE THE BIRD! THE BOY IS BEHIND 
YOU! SNIFF — SMELL HIM!” 
Harry was on his feet, ready. The ba silisk’s head was falling, its 
body coiling around, hitting pillar s as it twisted to face him. He 
could see the vast, bloody eye socket s, see the mouth stretching wide, 
wide enough to swallow him whole, lined with fangs long as his 
sword, thin, glitte ring, venomous — 
It lunged blindly — Harry dodged and it hit the Chamber wall. It 
lunged again, and its forked tong ue lashed Harry’s side. He raised 
the sword in both his hands — 
The basilisk lunged again, and t his time its aim was true — Harry 
threw his whole weight behind the sword and drove it to the hilt into 
the roof of the serpent’s mouth — 
But as warm blood drenched Harry’s arms, he felt a searing pain 
just above his elbow. One long, po isonous fang was sinking deeper 
and deeper into his arm and it splint ered as the basilisk keeled over 
sideways and fell, twitching, to the floor. 
Harry slid down the wall. He grippe d the fang that was spreading 
poison through his body and wrenched it out of his arm. But he 
knew it was too late. White-hot pain was spreading slowly and 
steadily from the wound. Even as he dropped the fang and watched 
his own blood soaking his robes, hi s vision went foggy. The Cham-
ber was dissolving in a whirl of dull color. 
A patch of scarlet swam past, and Harry heard a soft clatter of 
claws beside him. 
“Fawkes,” said Harry thickly. “You were fantastic, Fawkes. . . .” 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 321  He felt the bird lay its beautiful he ad on the spot where the serpent’s 
fang had pierced him. 
He could hear echoing footstep s and then a dark shadow moved 
in front of him. 
“You’re dead, Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s voice above him. “Dead. 
Even Dumbledore’s bird knows it. Do you see what he’s doing, Pot-
ter? He’s crying.” 
Harry blinked. Fawkes’s head slid in and out of focus. Thick, 
pearly tears were trickling down the glossy feathers. 
“I’m going to sit here and watch you die, Harry Potter. Take your 
time. I’m in no hurry.” 
Harry felt drowsy. Everything around him seemed to be spinning. 
“So ends the famous Harry Potter,” said Riddle’s distant voice. 
“Alone in the Chamber of Secrets, forsaken by his friends, defeated 
at last by the Dark Lord he so unwisely challenged . You’ll be back 
with your dear Mudblood mother soon, Harry. . . . She bought you twelve years of borrowed time . . . but Lord Voldemort got you in 
the end, as you kn ew he must. . . .” 
If this is dying , thought Harry, it’s not so bad. 
Even the pain was leaving him. . . . 
But was this dying? Instead of going black, the Chamber seemed 
to be coming back into focus. Harr y gave his head a little shake and 
there was Fawkes, still resting his head on Harry’s arm. A pearly 
patch of tears was shining all around the wound — except that there was no wound — 
“Get away, bird,” said Riddle’s voice suddenly. “Get away from 
him — I said, get away —” 
Harry raised his head. Riddle wa s pointing Harry’s wand at 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 322  Fawkes; there was a bang like a gun, and Fawkes took flight again in 
a whirl of gold and scarlet. 
“Phoenix tears . . .” said Riddle quietly, staring at Harry’s arm. 
“Of course . . . healing powe rs . . . I forgot . . .” 
He looked into Harry’s face. “But it makes no difference. In fact, 
I prefer it this way. Just you and me, Harry Potter . . . you and 
me. . . .” 
He raised the wand — Then, in a rush of wings, Fawkes had soared back overhead and 
something fell into Harry’s lap — the diary. 
For a split second, both Harry and Ri ddle, wand still raised, stared 
at it. Then, without thinking, withou t considering, as though he had 
meant to do it all along, Harry seized the basilisk fa ng on the floor 
next to him and plunge d it straight into the heart of the book. 
There was a long, dreadful, pierci ng scream. Ink spurted out of 
the diary in torrents, streaming over Harry’s hands, flooding the floor. Riddle was writhing and twis ting, screaming and flailing and 
then — 
He had gone. Harry’s wand fell to the floor with a clatter and 
there was silence. Silence except for the steady drip drip of ink still 
oozing from the diary. The basili sk venom had burned a sizzling 
hole right through it. 
Shaking all over, Harry pulled himself up. His head was spinning 
as though he’d just traveled miles by Floo powder. Slowly, he gath-ered together his wand and the Sort ing Hat, and, with a huge tug, 
retrieved the glittering sword from the roof of the basilisk’s mouth. 
Then came a faint moan from th e end of the Chamber. Ginny 
was stirring. As Harry hurried towa rd her, she sat up. Her bemused 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 323  eyes traveled from the huge form of the dead basilisk, over Harry, in 
his blood-soaked robes, then to th e diary in his hand. She drew a 
great, shuddering ga sp and tears began to pour down her face. 
“Harry — oh, Harry — I tried to tell you at b-breakfast, but I 
c-couldn’t say it in front of Percy — it was me, Harry — but I — I 
s-swear I d-didn’t mean to — R- Riddle made me, he t-took me 
over — and — how did you kill that — that thing? W-where’s 
Riddle? The last thing I r-remember is him coming out of the 
diary —” 
“It’s all right,” said Harry, hold ing up the diary, and showing 
Ginny the fang hole, “Riddle’s finished. Look! Him and the basilisk. 
C’mon, Ginny, let’s get out of here —” 
“I’m going to be expelled!” Ginny wept as Harry helped her awk-
wardly to her feet. “I’ve looked forw ard to coming to Hogwarts ever 
since B-Bill came and n-now I’ll have to leave and — w-what’ll 
Mum and Dad say ?” 
Fawkes was waiting for them, hove ring in the Chamber entrance. 
Harry urged Ginny forward; they stepped over the motionless coils 
of the dead basilisk, through the echoing gloom, and back into the 
tunnel. Harry heard the stone doors close behind them with a soft 
hiss. 
After a few minutes’ progress up the dark tunnel, a distant sound 
of slowly shifting rock reached Harry’s ears. 
“Ron!” Harry yelled, speeding up. “Ginny’s okay! I’ve got her!” 
He heard Ron give a strangled ch eer, and they turned the next 
bend to see his eager face starin g through the sizable gap he had 
managed to make in the rockfall. 
“Ginny !” Ron thrust an arm through the gap in the rock to pull 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 324  her through first. “You’re alive! I don’t believe it! What happened? 
How — what — where did that bird come from?” 
Fawkes had swooped through the gap after Ginny. 
“He’s Dumbledore’s,” said Harry, squeezing through himself. 
“How come you’ve got a sword ?” said Ron, gaping at the glitter-
ing weapon in Harry’s hand. 
“I’ll explain when we get out of he re,” said Harry with a sideways 
glance at Ginny, who was crying harder than ever. 
“But —” “Later,” Harry said shortly. He didn ’t think it was a good idea to 
tell Ron yet who’d been opening the Chamber, not in front of Ginny, 
anyway. “Where’s Lockhart?” 
“Back there,” said Ron, still look ing puzzled but jerking his head 
up the tunnel toward th e pipe. “He’s in a bad way. Come and see.” 
Led by Fawkes, whose wide scarlet wings emitted a soft golden 
glow in the darkness, they walked all the way back to the mouth of 
the pipe. Gilderoy Lockhart was si tting there, humming placidly to 
himself. 
“His memory’s gone,” said Ron. “The Memory Charm backfired. 
Hit him instead of us. Hasn’t got a cl ue who he is, or where he is, or 
who we are. I told him to come an d wait here. He’s a danger to him-
self.” 
Lockhart peered good-naturedly up at them all. 
“Hello,” he said. “Odd sort of place, this, isn’t it? Do you live here?” 
“No,” said Ron, raising his eyebrows at Harry. 
Harry bent down and looked up the long, dark pipe. 
“Have you thought how we’re going to get back up this?” he said 
to Ron. 
 
THE HEIR OF SLYTHERIN 
 325  Ron shook his head, but Fawkes the phoenix had swooped past 
Harry and was now fluttering in fron t of him, his beady eyes bright 
in the dark. He was waving his long gold en tail feathers. Harry 
looked uncertainly at him. 
“He looks like he wants you to grab hold . . .” said Ron, look-
ing perplexed. “But you’re much too heavy for a bird to pull up 
there —” 
“Fawkes,” said Harry, “isn’t an ordinary bird.” He turned quickly 
to the others. “We’ve got to hold on to each other. Ginny, grab Ron’s 
hand. Professor Lockhart —” 
“He means you,” said Ro n sharply to Lockhart. 
“You hold Ginny’s other hand —” 
Harry tucked the sword and the Sorting Hat into his belt, Ron 
took hold of the back of Harry’ s robes, and Harry reached out and 
took hold of Fawkes’s st rangely hot tail feathers. 
An extraordinary lightness seemed to spread through his whole 
body and the next second, in a rush of wings, they were flying upward through the pipe. Harry could hear Lockhart dangling 
below him, saying, “Amazing! Amazin g! This is just like magic!” 
The chill air was whipping through Harry’s hair, and before he’d 
stopped enjoying the ride, it was ov er — all four of them were hit-
ting the wet floor of Moaning Myrt le’s bathroom, and as Lockhart 
straightened his hat, the sink that hid the pipe was sliding back into 
place. 
Myrtle goggled at them. 
“You’re alive,” she said blankly to Harry. 
“There’s no need to sound so di sappointed,” he said grimly, wip-
ing flecks of blood and slime off his glasses. 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 326  “Oh, well . . . I’d just been thin king . . . if you had died, you’d 
have been welcome to share my toilet,” said Myrtle, blushing silver. 
“Urgh!” said Ron as they left th e bathroom for the dark, deserted 
corridor outside. “Harry! I think Myrtle’s grown fond of you! You’ve 
got competition, Ginny!” 
But tears were still flooding silently down Ginny’s face. 
“Where now?” said Ron, with an anxious look at Ginny. Harry 
pointed. 
Fawkes was leading the way, gl owing gold along the corridor. 
They strode after him, and moment s later, found themselves outside 
Professor McGonagall’s office. 
Harry knocked and push ed the door open.

or a moment there was silenc e as Harry, Ron, Ginny, and 
Lockhart stood in the doorway, covered in muck and slime 
and (in Harry’s case) blood. Then there wa s a scream. 
“Ginny !” 
It was Mrs. Weasley, who had been sitting crying in front of the 
fire. She leapt to her feet, closely followed by Mr. Weasley, and both 
of them flung themselves on their daughter. 
Harry, however, was looking pa st them. Professor Dumbledore 
was standing by the mantelpiece, beaming, next to Professor Mc-
Gonagall, who was taking great, steadying gasps, clutching her 
chest. Fawkes went whooshing pa st Harry’s ear and settled on 
Dumbledore’s shoulder, just as Harry found himself and Ron being 
swept into Mrs. Weasley’s tight embrace. 
“You saved her! You saved her! How did you do it?” 
“I think we’d all like to know that,” said Professor McGonagall 
weakly. F 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 328  Mrs. Weasley let go of Harry, wh o hesitated for a moment, then 
walked over to the desk and laid upon it the Sorting Hat, the ruby-
encrusted sword, and what re mained of Riddle’s diary. 
Then he started telling them ever ything. For nearly a quarter of 
an hour he spoke into the rapt silence: He told them about hearing 
the disembodied voice, how Hermio ne had finally realized that he 
was hearing a basilisk in the pipes; how he and Ron had followed 
the spiders into the forest, that Aragog had told them where the last 
victim of the basilisk had died; how he had guessed that Moaning 
Myrtle had been the victim, and th at the entrance to the Chamber 
of Secrets might be in her bathroom. . . . 
“Very well,” Professor McGonagall prompted him as he paused, 
“so you found out where the entrance was — breaking a hundred 
school rules into pieces along the way, I might add — but how on 
earth did you all get out of there alive, Potter?” 
So Harry, his voice now growing hoarse from all this talking, 
told them about Fawkes’s timely arrival and about the Sorting Hat giving him the sword. But then he faltered. He had so far avoided 
mentioning Riddle’s diary — or Gi nny. She was standing with her 
head against Mrs. Weasley’s shoulder, and tears were still coursing 
silently down her cheeks. What if they expelled her ? Harry thought 
in panic. Riddle’s diary didn’t wo rk anymore. . . . How could they 
prove it had been he who’d made he r do it all? 
Instinctively, Harry looked at Dumbledore, who smiled faintly, 
the firelight glancing off his half-moon spectacles. 
“What interests me most,” said Dumbledore gently, “is how 
Lord Voldemort managed to enchant Ginny, when my sources tell 
me he is currently in hiding in the forests of Albania.” 
 
DOBBY’S REWARD 
 329  Relief — warm, sweeping, glor ious relief — swept over Harry. 
“W-what’s that?” said Mr. Weasley in a stunned voice. “ You-
Know-Who ? En-enchant Ginny ? But Ginny’s not . . . Ginny hasn’t 
been . . . has she?” 
“It was this diary,” said Harry qu ickly, picking it up and show-
ing it to Dumbledore. “Riddle wrote it when he was sixteen. . . .” 
Dumbledore took the diary from Harry and peered keenly down 
his long, crooked nose at its burnt and soggy pages. 
“Brilliant,” he said softly. “Of course, he was probably the most 
brilliant student Hogwarts has ever seen.” He turned around to the 
Weasleys, who were look ing utterly bewildered. 
“Very few people know that Lo rd Voldemort was once called 
Tom Riddle. I taught him myself, fi fty years ago, at Hogwarts. He 
disappeared after leaving the school . . . traveled far and wide . . . 
sank so deeply into the Dark Arts , consorted with the very worst of 
our kind, underwent so many dang erous, magical transformations, 
that when he resurfaced as Lord Voldemort, he was barely recog-
nizable. Hardly anyone connected Lord Voldemort with the clever, 
handsome boy who was once Head Boy here.” 
“But, Ginny,” said Mrs. Weasley. “What’s our Ginny got to do 
with — with — him?” 
“His d-diary!” Ginny sobbed. “I’v e b-been writing in it, and he’s 
been w-writing ba ck all year —” 
“Ginny !” said Mr. Weasley, flabberg asted. “Haven’t I taught you 
anything ? What have I always told yo u? Never trust anything that 
can think for itself if you can’t see where it keeps its brain. Why didn’t 
you show the diary to me, or your mother? A suspicious object like 
that, it was clearly full of Dark Magic —” 
 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 330  “I d-didn’t know,” sobbed Ginny. “I found it inside one of the 
books Mum got me. I th-thought someone had just left it in there 
and forgotten about it —” 
“Miss Weasley should go up to the hospital wing right away,” 
Dumbledore interrupted in a firm voice. “This has been a terrible 
ordeal for her. There will be no punishment. Older and wiser wiz-
ards than she have been hoodwin ked by Lord Voldemort.” He 
strode over to the door and opened it . “Bed rest and perhaps a large, 
steaming mug of hot chocolate. I al ways find that cheers me up,” 
he added, twinkling kindly down at her. “You will find that Madam 
Pomfrey is still awake. She’s just giving out Mandrake juice — I 
daresay the basilisk’s victims will be waking up any moment.” 
“So Hermione’s okay!” said Ron brightly. “There has been no lasting harm done, Ginny,” said Dumble-
dore. 
Mrs. Weasley led Ginny out, and Mr. Weasley followed, still 
looking deeply shaken. 
“You know, Minerva,” Professor Dumbledore said thoughtfully 
to Professor McGonagall, “I think all this merits a good feast. 
Might I ask you to go and alert the kitchens?” 
“Right,” said Professor McGonaga ll crisply, also moving to the 
door. “I’ll leave you to deal with Potter and Weasley, shall I?” 
“Certainly,” said Dumbledore. She left, and Harry an d Ron gazed uncertainly at Dumbledore. 
What exactly had Professor McGonagall meant, deal with them? 
Surely — surely — they weren’t about to be punished? 
“I seem to remember telling you both that I would have to expel 
you if you broke any more scho ol rules,” said Dumbledore. 
 
DOBBY’S REWARD 
 331  Ron opened his mouth in horror. 
“Which goes to show that the best of us must sometimes eat our 
words,” Dumbledore went on, smilin g. “You will both receive Spe-
cial Awards for Services to the School and — let me see — yes, I think two hundred points apiece for Gryffindor.” 
Ron went as brightly pink as Lockhart’s valentine flowers and 
closed his mouth again. 
“But one of us seems to be keep ing mightily quiet about his part 
in this dangerous adventure,” Du mbledore added. “Why so mod-
est, Gilderoy?” 
Harry gave a start. He had comple tely forgotten about Lockhart. 
He turned and saw that Lockhart was standing in a corner of the 
room, still wearing his vague sm ile. When Dumbledore addressed 
him, Lockhart looked over his sh oulder to see who he was talking 
to. 
“Professor Dumbledore,” Ron said quickly, “there was an 
accident down in the Chamber of Secrets. Professor Lockhart —” 
“Am I a professor?” said Lockhart in mild surprise. “Goodness. I 
expect I was hopeless, was I?” 
“He tried to do a Memory Charm and the wand backfired,” Ron 
explained quietly to Dumbledore. 
“Dear me,” said Dumbledore, shaking his head, his long silver 
mustache quivering. “Impaled upon your own sword, Gilderoy!” 
“ S w o r d ? ” s a i d L o c k h a r t d i m l y . “ H a v e n ’ t g o t a s w o r d . T h a t b o y 
has, though.” He pointed at Harry. “He’ll lend you one.” 
“Would you mind taking Profes sor Lockhart up to the infir-
mary, too?” Dumbledore said to Ron. “I’d like a few more words 
with Harry. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 332  Lockhart ambled out. Ron cast a curious look back at Dumble-
dore and Harry as he closed the door. 
Dumbledore crossed to one of the chairs by the fire. 
“Sit down, Harry,” he said, and Harry sat, feeling unaccountably 
nervous. 
“First of all, Harry, I want to thank you,” said Dumbledore, eyes 
twinkling again. “You must have shown me real loyalty down in 
the Chamber. Nothing but that could have called Fawkes to you.” 
He stroked the phoenix, whic h had fluttered down onto his 
knee. Harry grinned awkwardly as Dumbledore watched him. 
“And so you met Tom Riddle,” said Dumbledore thoughtfully. 
“I imagine he was most interested in you. . . .” 
Suddenly, something that was na gging at Harry came tumbling 
out of his mouth. 
“Professor Dumbledore . . . Riddle said I’m like him. Strange 
likenesses, he said. . . .” 
“Did he, now?” said Dumbledore, looking thoughtfully at Harry 
from under his thick silver eyebrows. “And what do you think, 
Harry?” 
“I don’t think I’m like him!” said Harry, more loudly than he’d 
intended. “I mean, I’m — I’m in Gryffindor, I’m . . .” 
But he fell silent, a lurking doubt resurfacing in his mind. 
“Professor,” he started again af ter a moment. “The Sorting Hat 
told me I’d — I’d have done well in Slytherin. Everyone thought I 
was Slytherin’s heir for a while . . . because I can speak Parsel -
tongue. . . .” 
“You can speak Parseltongue, Harry,” said Dumbledore calmly, 
“because Lord Voldemort — who is the last remaining descendant 
 
DOBBY’S REWARD 
 333  of Salazar Slytherin — can spea k Parseltongue. Unless I’m much 
mistaken, he transferred some of his own powers to you the night 
he gave you that scar. Not something he intended to do, I’m sure. . . .” 
“Voldemort put a bi t of himself in me?” Harry said, thunder-
struck. 
“It certainly seems so.” 
“So I should be in Slytherin,” Harry said, looking desperately 
into Dumbledore’s face. “The So rting Hat could see Slytherin’s 
power in me, and it —” 
“Put you in Gryffindor,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Listen to 
me, Harry. You happen to have ma ny qualities Salazar Slytherin 
prized in his hand-picked students. His own very rare gift, Parsel-
tongue — resourcefulness — dete rmination — a certain disregard 
for rules,” he added, his mustache quivering again. “Yet the Sorting 
Hat placed you in Gryffindor. You know why that was. Think.” 
“It only put me in Gryffindor,” said Harry in a defeated voice, 
“because I asked not to go in Slytherin. . . .” 
“Exactly, ” said Dumbledore, beaming once more. “Which makes 
you very different from Tom Riddle. It is our choices, Harry, that 
show what we truly are, far more than our abilities.” Harry sat mo-
tionless in his chair, stunned. “I f you want proof, Harry, that you 
belong in Gryffindor, I suggest you look more closely at this.” 
Dumbledore reached across to Pr ofessor McGonagall’s desk, 
picked up the blood-stained silver sword, and handed it to Harry. 
Dully, Harry turned it ov er, the rubies blazing in the firelight. And 
then he saw the name engraved just below the hilt. 
Godric Gryffindor. 
 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 334  “Only a true Gryffindor could have pulled that out of the hat, 
Harry,” said Dumbledore simply. 
For a minute, neither of them spoke. Then Dumbledore pulled 
open one of the drawers in Profes sor McGonagall’s desk and took 
out a quill and a bottle of ink. 
“What you need, Harry, is some f ood and sleep. I suggest you go 
down to the feast, while I write to Azkaban — we need our game-
keeper back. And I must draft an advertisement for the Daily 
Prophet, too,” he added thoughtfully. “We’ll be needing a new De-
fense Against the Dark Arts teache r. . . . Dear me, we do seem to 
run through them, don’t we?” 
Harry got up and cro ssed to the door. He ha d just reached for 
the handle, however, when the door burst open so violently that it 
bounced back off the wall. 
Lucius Malfoy stood th ere, fury in his face. And cowering be-
hind his legs, heavily wr apped in bandages, was Dobby. 
“Good evening, Lucius,” said Dumbledore pleasantly. 
Mr. Malfoy almost knocked Harry over as he swept into the 
room. Dobby went scurrying in afte r him, crouching at the hem of 
his cloak, a look of abject terror on his face. 
The elf was carrying a stained rag with which he was attempting 
to finish cleaning Mr. Malfoy’s shoes. Apparently Mr. Malfoy had 
set out in a great hurry, for not only were his shoes half-polished, 
but his usually sleek hair was dish eveled. Ignoring the elf bobbing 
apologetically around his ankles, he fixed his cold eyes upon Dum-
bledore. 
“So!” he said “You’ve come back . The governors suspended you, 
but you still saw fit to return to Hogwarts.” 
DOBBY’S REWARD 
 335  “Well, you see, Lucius,” said Du mbledore, smiling serenely, “the 
other eleven governors contacted me today. It was something like 
being caught in a hailstorm of owls , to tell the truth. They’d heard 
that Arthur Weasley’s daughter had been ki lled and wanted me 
back here at once. They seemed to think I was the best man for the 
job after all. Very strang e tales they told me, too. . . . Several of 
them seemed to think that you ha d threatened to curse their fami-
lies if they didn’t agree to suspend me in the first place.” 
Mr. Malfoy went even paler than usual, but his eyes were still 
slits of fury. 
“So — have you stopped the atta cks yet?” he sneered. “Have you 
caught the culprit?” 
“We have,” said Dumbledore, with a smile. 
“Well?” said Mr. Malfoy sharply. “Who is it?” 
“The same person as last time, Lucius,” said Dumbledore. “But 
this time, Lord Voldemort was acting through somebody else. By means of this diary.” 
He held up the small black book with the large hole through the 
center, watching Mr. Malfoy closely. Harry, however, was watching 
Dobby. 
The elf was doing something ve ry odd. His great eyes fixed 
meaningfully on Harry, he kept pointing at the diary, then at Mr. 
Malfoy, and then hitting himself hard on the head wi th his fist. 
“I see . . .” said Mr. Malf oy slowly to Dumbledore. 
“A clever plan,” said Dumbledore in a level voice, still staring 
Mr. Malfoy straight in the eye. “Because if Harry here” — Mr. 
Malfoy shot Harry a swift, sharp look — “and his friend Ron hadn’t 
discovered this book, why — Ginny Weasley might have taken all 
 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 336  the blame. No one would ever have been able to prove she hadn’t 
acted of her own free will. . . .” 
Mr. Malfoy said nothing. His face was suddenly masklike. 
“And imagine,” Dumbledore went on, “what might have hap-
pened then. . . . The Weasleys are one of our most prominent 
pure-blood families. Imagine the ef fect on Arthur Weasley and his 
Muggle Protection Act, if his own daughter was discovered attack-
ing and killing Muggle-borns. . . . Very fortunate the diary was dis-
covered, and Riddle’s memories wiped from it. Who knows what 
the consequences might have been otherwise. . . .” 
Mr. Malfoy forced himself to speak. “Very fortunate,” he said stiffly. 
And still, behind his back, Dobby was pointi ng, first to the di-
ary, then to Lucius Malfoy, th en punching himself in the head. 
And Harry suddenly understood. He nodded at Dobby, and 
Dobby backed into a corner, now twisting his ears in punishment. 
“Don’t you want to know how Ginny got hold of that diary, Mr. 
Malfoy?” said Harry. 
Lucius Malfoy rounded on him. 
“How should I know how the stupid little girl got hold of it?” he 
said. 
“Because you gave it to her,” sa id Harry. “In Flourish and Blotts. 
You picked up her old Transfigur ation book and sl ipped the diary 
inside it, didn’t you?” 
He saw Mr. Malfoy’s white hands clench and unclench. 
“Prove it,” he hissed. 
“Oh, no one will be able to do that,” said Dumbledore, smiling 
at Harry. “Not now that Riddle ha s vanished from the book. On 
 
DOBBY’S REWARD 
 337  the other hand, I would advise you, Lucius, no t to go giving out 
any more of Lord Voldemort’s old school things. If any more of 
them find their way into innocent hands, I think Arthur Weasley, 
for one, will make sure they are traced back to you. . . .” 
Lucius Malfoy stood for a moment, and Harry distinctly saw his 
right hand twitch as though he was longing to reach for his wand. 
Instead, he turned to his house-elf. 
“We’re going, Dobby!” He wrenched open the door and as the elf came hurrying up to 
him, he kicked him right throug h it. They could hear Dobby 
squealing with pain all the way along the corridor. Harry stood for a moment, thinking hard. Then it came to him — 
“Professor Dumbledore,” he said hu rriedly. “Can I give that di-
ary back to Mr. Malfoy, please?” 
“Certainly, Harry,” said Dumble dore calmly. “But hurry. The 
feast, remember. . . .” 
Harry grabbed the diary and dashed out of the office. He could 
hear Dobby’s squeals of pain receding around the corner. Quickly, 
wondering if this plan could po ssibly work, Harry took off one of 
his shoes, pulled off his slimy, filt hy sock, and stuffed the diary into 
it. Then he ran down the dark corridor. 
He caught up with them at the top of the stairs. 
“Mr. Malfoy,” he gasped, skidding to a halt, “I’ve got something 
for you —” 
And he forced the smelly sock into Lucius Malfoy’s hand. 
“What the — ?” 
Mr. Malfoy ripped the sock off the diary, threw it aside, then 
looked furiously from the ruined book to Harry. 
 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 338  “You’ll meet the same sticky end as your parents one of these 
days, Harry Potter,” he said sof tly. “They were meddlesome fools, 
too.” 
He turned to go. 
“Come, Dobby. I said, come. ” 
But Dobby didn’t move. He was holding up Harry’s disgusting, 
slimy sock, and looking at it as though it were a priceless treasure. 
“Master has given a sock,” said the elf in wonderment. “Master 
gave it to Dobby.” 
“What’s that?” spat Mr. Ma lfoy. “What did you say?” 
“Got a sock,” said Dobby in di sbelief. “Master threw it, and 
Dobby caught it, and Dobby — Dobby is free.” 
Lucius Malfoy stood frozen, staring at the elf. Then he lunged at 
Harry. 
“You’ve lost me my servant, boy!” 
But Dobby shouted, “You shal l not harm Harry Potter!” 
There was a loud bang, and Mr. Malfoy was thrown backward. 
He crashed down the stairs, three at a time, landing in a crumpled 
heap on the landing below. He got up, his face livid, and pulled out 
his wand, but Dobby raised a long, threatening finger. 
“You shall go now,” he said fi ercely, pointing down at Mr. Mal-
foy. “You shall not touch Harry Potter. You shall go now.” 
Lucius Malfoy had no choice. With a last, incensed stare at the 
pair of them, he swung his cloak around him and hurried out of sight. 
“Harry Potter freed Dobby!” said the elf shrilly, gazing up at 
Harry, moonlight from the nearest wi ndow reflected in his orb-like 
eyes. “Harry Potter set Dobby free!” 
 
DOBBY’S REWARD 
 339  “Least I could do, Dobby,” said Harry, grinning. “Just promise 
never to try and save my life again.” 
The elf’s ugly brown face split suddenly into a wide, toothy 
smile. 
“I’ve just got one question, Dobb y,” said Harry as Dobby pulled 
on Harry’s sock with shaking hand s. “You told me all this had 
nothing to do with He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named, remember? 
Well —” 
“It was a clue, sir,” said Dobby, hi s eyes widening, as though this 
was obvious. “Was giving you a clue. The Dark Lord, before he 
changed his name, could be freely named, you see?” 
“Right,” said Harry weakly. “Well, I’d better go. There’s a feast, 
and my friend Hermione should be awake by now. . . .” 
Dobby threw his arms around Harry’s middle and hugged him. “Harry Potter is greater by far than Dobby knew!” he sobbed. 
“Farewell, Harry Potter!” 
And with a final loud cr ack, Dobby disappeared. 
 
Harry had been to several Hogwarts feasts, but never one quite like 
this. Everybody was in their pajama s, and the celebration lasted all 
night. Harry didn’t know whethe r the best bit was Hermione run-

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 340  tell them all that the exams had been canceled as a school treat 
(“Oh, no!” said Hermione), or Dumbledore announcing that, un-
fortunately, Professor Lockhart would be unable to return next 
year, owing to the fact that he needed to go away and get his mem-
ory back. Quite a few of the teache rs joined in the cheering that 
greeted this news. 
“Shame,” said Ron, helping himself to a jam doughnut. “He was 
starting to grow on me.” 
 
The rest of the final term passed in a haze of blazing sunshine. 
Hogwarts was back to normal with only a few, small differences — 
Defense Against the Dark Arts classes were canceled (“but we’ve had plenty of practice at that anyway,” Ron told a disgruntled 
Hermione) and Lucius Malfoy had been sacked as a school gover-
nor. Draco was no longer strutting around the school as though he 
owned the place. On the contrary, he looked resentful and sulky. 
On the other hand, Ginny Weasle y was perfectly happy again. 
Too soon, it was time for the journey home on the Hogwarts Ex-
press. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Fred, George, and Ginny got a com-
partment to themselves. They made the most of the last few hours 
in which they were allowed to do magic before the holidays. They 
played Exploding Snap, set off the very last of Fred and George’s 
Filibuster fireworks, and practice d disarming each other by magic. 
Harry was getting very good at it. 
They were almost at King’s Cross when Harry remembered 
something. 
“Ginny — what did you see Perc y doing, that he didn’t want 
you to tell anyone?” 
 
DOBBY’S REWARD 
 341  “Oh, that,” said Ginny, giggling. “Well — Percy’s got a girlfriend. ” 
Fred dropped a stack of books on George’s head. 
“What ?” 
“It’s that Ravenclaw prefect, Pene lope Clearwater,” said Ginny. 
“That’s who he was writing to all last summer. He’s been meeting 
her all over the school in secret. I walked in on them kissing in an 
empty classroom one day. He was so upset when she was — you 
know — attacked. You won’t tease him, will you?” she added anx-
iously. 
“Wouldn’t dream of it,” said Fred, who was looking like his 
birthday had come early. 
“Definitely not,” said George, sniggering. 
The Hogwarts Express slowed and finally stopped. 
Harry pulled out his quill and a bit of parchment and turned to 
Ron and Hermione. 
“This is called a telephone number ,” he told Ron, scribbling it 
twice, tearing the parchment in tw o, and handing it to them. “I 
told your dad how to use a tele phone last summer — he’ll know. 
Call me at the Dursleys’, okay? I can’t stand another two months 
with only Dudley to talk to. . . .” 
“Your aunt and uncle will be prou d, though, won’t they?” said 
Hermione as they got off the trai n and joined the crowd thronging 
toward the enchanted barrier. “When they hear what you did this year? 
“Proud?” said Harry. “Are you crazy? All those times I could’ve 
died, and I didn’t manage it? They’ll be furious. . . .” 
And together they walked back through the gateway to the 
Muggle world.
