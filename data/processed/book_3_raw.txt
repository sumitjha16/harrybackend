 1  OWL POST 
 
 
 
arry Potter was a highly unus ual boy in many ways. For 
one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any 
other time of year. For another, h e real ly wa nted to d o his ho m e-
work but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night. And he 
also happened to be a wizard. 
It was nearly midnight, and he was lying on his st omach in bed, 
the blankets drawn right over his he ad like a tent, a flashlight in 
one hand and a large leather-bound book (A History of Magic by 
Bathilda Bagshot) propped open against the pillow. Harry moved 
the tip of his eagle-feather quil l down the page, frowning as he 
looked for something that would he lp him write his essay, “Witch 
Burning in the Fourte enth Century Was Comp letely Pointless — 
discuss.” 
The quill paused at the top of a likely-looking paragraph. Harry 
pushed his round glasses up the br idge of his nose, moved his flash-
light closer to the book, and read: H 
CHAPTER ONE 
 2  Non-magic people (more commonly known as 
Muggles) were particularly afraid of magic in me-
dieval times, but not very good at recognizing it. On 
the rare occasion that they did catch a real witch or 
wizard, burning had no effect whatsoever. The witch 
or wizard would perform a basic Flame Freezing Charm and then pretend to shriek with pain while 
enjoying a gentle, tickling sensation. Indeed, Wen-delin the Weird enjoyed being burned so much that 
she allowed herself to be caught no less than forty-
seven times in various disguises. 
 
Harry put his quill be tween his teeth and reached underneath 
his pillow for his ink bottle and a roll of parchment. Slowly and 
very carefully he unscre wed the ink bottle, dipped his quill into it, 
and began to write, pausing every now and then to listen, because 
if any of the Dursleys heard the scratching of his quill on their way 
to the bathroom, he’d probably find himself locked in the cup-
board under the stairs for the rest of the summer. 
The Dursley family of number four , Privet Drive, was the reason 
that Harry never enjoyed his summer holidays. Uncle Vernon, 
Aunt Petunia, and their son, Dudley , were Harry’s only living rela-
tives. They were Muggles, and th ey had a very medieval attitude 
toward magic. Harry’s dead pare nts, who had been a witch and 
wizard themselves, were never me ntioned under the Dursleys’ roof. 
For years, Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon had hoped that if they 
kept Harry as downtr odden as possible, they would be able to 
squash the magic out of him. To their fury, they had been unsuc-
cessful. These days they lived in terror of anyone finding out that 
OWL POST 
 3  Harry had spent most of the last two years at Hogwarts School of 
Witchcraft and Wizardry. The most they could do, however, was 
to lock away Harry’s spellbooks , wand, cauldron, and broomstick 
at the start of the summer break, and forbid him to talk to the 
neighbors. 
This separation from his spellb ooks had been a real problem for 
Harry, because his teache rs at Hogwarts had given him a lot of hol-
iday work. One of the essays, a pa rticularly nasty one about shrink-
ing potions, was for Harry’s least favorite teacher, Professor Snape, 
who would be delighted to have an excuse to give Harry detention 
for a month. Harry had therefore seiz ed his chance in the first week 
of the holidays. While Uncle Vern on, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley 
had gone out into the front garden to admire Uncle Vernon’s new 
company car (in very lo ud voices, so that th e rest of the street 
would notice it too), Harry had cr ept downstairs, picked the lock 
on the cupboard under the stairs, grabbed some of his books, and 
hidden them in his bedroom. As long as he didn’t leave spots of ink on the sheets, the Dursleys need nev er know that he was studying 
magic by night. 
Harry was particularly keen to avoid trouble with his aunt and 
uncle at the moment, as they were already in an especially bad 
mood with him, all beca use he’d received a te lephone call from a 
fellow wizard one week in to the school vacation. 
Ron Weasley, who was one of Harry ’s best friends at Hogwarts, 
came from a whole family of wizards. This meant that he knew a lot of things Harry didn’t, but had never used a telephone before. 
Most unluckily it had been Uncl e Vernon who had answered the 
call. 
“Vernon Dursley speaking.” 
CHAPTER ONE 
 4  Harry, who happened to be in the room at the time, froze as he 
heard Ron’s voice answer. 
“HELLO? HELLO? CAN YOU HEAR ME? I — WANT — 
TO — TALK — TO — HARRY — POTTER!” 
Ron was yelling so loudly that Uncle Vernon jumped and held 
the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression 
of mingled fury and alarm. 
“WHO IS THIS?” he roared in the direction of the mouthpiece. 
“WHO ARE YOU?” 
“RON — WEASLEY!” Ron bellowed back, as though he and 
Uncle Vernon were speaking from opposite ends of a football field. “I’M — A — FRIEND — OF — HARRY’S — FROM — 
SCHOOL —” 
Uncle Vernon’s small eyes swiveled around to Harry, who was 
rooted to the spot. 
“ T H E R E I S N O H A R R Y P O T T E R H E R E ! ” h e r o a r e d , n o w 
holding the receiver at arm’s length, as though frightened it might explode. “I DON’T KNOW WHAT SCHOOL YOU’RE TALK-
ING ABOUT! NEVER CONTACT ME AGAIN! DON’T YOU 
COME NEAR MY FAMILY!” 
And he threw the receiver back onto the telephone as if drop-
ping a poisonous spider. 
The fight that had followed ha d been one of the worst ever. 
“ H O W D A R E Y O U G I V E T H I S N U M B E R T O P E O P L E 
LIKE — PEOPLE LIKE YOU !” Uncle Vernon had roared, spray-
ing Harry with spit. 
Ron obviously realized that he’d gotten Harry into trouble, 
because he hadn’t called again. Harry’s other best friend from 
 
OWL POST 
 5  Hogwarts, Hermione Granger, hadn ’t been in touch either. Harry 
suspected that Ron had warned He rmione not to call, which was a 
pity, because Hermione, the cleverest witch in Harry’s year, had 
Muggle parents, knew perfectly well how to use a telephone, and 
would probably have had enough sens e not to say that she went to 
Hogwarts. 
So Harry had had no word from an y of his wizarding friends for 
five long weeks, and this summer was turning out to be almost as 
bad as the last one. There was just one very small improvement — 
after swearing that he wouldn’t use her to send letters to any of his 
friends, Harry had been allowed to let his owl, Hedwig, out at night. Uncle Vernon had given in because of the racket Hedwig 
made if she was locked in her cage all the time. 
Harry finished writing about Wend elin the Weird and paused to 
listen again. The silence in the dark house was broken only by the distant, grunting snores of his enormous cousin, Dudley. It must be 
very late, Harry thought. His eyes were itching with tiredness. Per-
haps he’d finish this essay tomorrow night. . . . 
He replaced the top of the ink bottle; pulled an old pillowcase 
from under his bed; put the flashlight, A History of Magic, his essay, 
quill, and ink inside it; got out of bed; and hid the lot under a loose floorboard under his bed. Then he stood up, stretched, and 
checked the time on th e luminous alarm clock on his bedside table. 
It was one o’clock in the mornin g. Harry’s stomach gave a funny 
jolt. He had been thir teen years old, withou t realizing it, for a 
whole hour. 
Yet another unusual thing about Harry was how little he looked 
forward to his birthdays. He had ne ver received a birthday card in 
 
CHAPTER ONE 
 6  his life. The Dursleys had completely ignored his last two birthdays, 
and he had no reason to suppose they would remember this one. 
Harry walked across the dark ro om, past Hedwig’s large, empty 
cage, to the open window. He leaned on the sill, the cool night air 
pleasant on his face after a long time under the blankets. Hedwig 
had been absent for tw o nights now. Harry wasn’t worried about 
her: she’d been gone this long befo re. But he hoped she’d be back 
soon — she was the only living creature in this house who didn’t 
flinch at the sight of him. 
Harry, though still rather smal l and skinny for his age, had 
grown a few inches over the last year. His jet-black hair, however, 
was just as it always had been — stubbornly untidy, whatever he 
did to it. The eyes behi nd his glasses were brig ht green, and on his 
forehead, clearly visible through hi s hair, was a thin scar, shaped 
like a bolt of lightning. 
Of all the unusual things about Ha rry, this scar was the most ex-
traordinary of all. It was not, as the Dursleys had pretended for ten 
years, a souvenir of the car crash th at had killed Harry’s parents, be-
cause Lily and James Potter had not died in a car crash. They had 
been murdered, murdered by the most feared Dark wizard for a 
hundred years, Lord Voldemort. Harry had escaped from the same 
attack with nothing more than a scar on his forehead, where Volde-
mort’s curse, instead of killing him, had rebounded upon its origi-
nator. Barely alive, Voldemort had fled. . . . 
But Harry had come fa ce-to-face with him at Hogwarts. Re-
membering their last meeting as he stood at the dark window, 
Harry had to admit he was lucky even to have re ached his thir-
teenth birthday. 
He scanned the starry sky for a sign of Hedwig, perhaps soaring 
OWL POST 
 7  back to him with a dead mouse dangling from her beak, expecting 
praise. Gazing absently over the rooftops, it was a few seconds be-
fore Harry realized what he was seeing. 
Silhouetted against the golden moon, and growing larger every 
moment, was a large, strangely lops ided creature, and it was flap-
ping in Harry’s direction. He sto od quite still, watching it sink 
lower and lower. For a split second he hesitated, his hand on the 
window latch, wondering whether to slam it shut . But then the 
bizarre creature soared over one of the street lamps of Privet Drive, 
and Harry, realizing what it was, leapt aside. 
Through the window soared three owls, two of them holding up 
the third, which appeared to be unconscious. They landed with a 
soft flump on Harry’s bed, and the middl e owl, which was large and 
gray, keeled right over and lay mo tionless. There was a large pack-
age tied to its legs. 
Harry recognized the unconscious owl at once — his name 
was Errol, and he belonged to the Weasley family. Harry dashed 
to the bed, untied the cords around Errol’s legs, took off the par-
cel, and then carried Errol to Hedwig’s cage. Errol opened one 
bleary eye, gave a feeble hoot of thanks, and began to gulp some 
water. 
Harry turned back to the rema ining owls. One of them, the 
large snowy female, was his own He dwig. She, too, was carrying a 
parcel and looked extremely please d with herself. She gave Harry 
an affectionate nip wi th her beak as he removed her burden, then 
flew across the room to join Errol. 
Harry didn’t recognize the thir d owl, a handsome tawny one, 
but he knew at once where it had come from, because in addition 
to a third package, it was carryi ng a letter bearing the Hogwarts 
CHAPTER ONE 
 8  crest. When Harry reli eved this owl of its burden, it ruffled its 
feathers importantly, stretched it s wings, and took off through the 
window into the night. 
Harry sat down on his bed and grabbed Errol’s package, ripped 
off the brown paper, and discovered a present wrapped in gold, and 
his first ever birthday card. Fingers trembling slightly, he opened 
the envelope. Two pieces of paper fell out — a letter and a news-
paper clipping. 
The clipping had clearly come ou t of the wizarding newspaper, 
the Daily Prophet, because the people in the black-and-white pic-
ture were moving. Harry picked up the clipping, smoothed it out, 
and read: 
MINISTRY OF MAGIC EMPLOYEE 
SCOOPS GRAND PRIZE 
Arthur Weasley, Head of the Misuse of Muggle Ar-
tifacts Office at the Mini stry of Magic, has won the 
annual Daily Prophet Grand Prize Galleon Draw. 
A delighted Mr. Weasley told the Daily Prophet, 
“We will be spending the gold on a summer holi-
day in Egypt, where our eldest son, Bill, works as a 
curse breaker for Gringotts Wizarding Bank.” 
The Weasley family will be spending a month in 
Egypt, returning for the start of the new school year at Hogwarts, which five of the Weasley chil-dren currently attend. 
Harry scanned the moving photogra ph, and a grin spread across 
his face as he saw all nine of th e Weasleys waving furiously at him, 
OWL POST 
 9  standing in front of a large pyramid. Plump little Mrs. Weasley; 
tall, balding Mr. Weasley; six sons; and one daughter, all (though 
the black-and-white picture didn’t show it) with fl aming-red hair. 
Right in the middle of the pictur e was Ron, tall and gangling, with 
his pet rat, Scabbers, on his shou lder and his arm around his little 
sister, Ginny. 
Harry couldn’t think of anyone who deserved to win a large pile 
of gold more than the Weasleys, who were very nice and extremely 
poor. He picked up Ron’s letter and unfolded it. 
 
Dear Harry, 
Happy birthday! 
Look, I’m really sorry about that telephone call. I hope the 
Muggles didn’t give you a hard time. I asked Dad, and he 
reckons I shouldn’t have shouted. 
It’s amazing here in Egypt. Bill’s taken us around all the 
tombs and you wouldn’t believe the curses those old Egyptian wizards put on them. Mum wouldn’t let Ginny come in the last one. There we re all these mutant skeletons in there, 
of Muggles who’d broken in and grown extra heads and stuff. 
I couldn’t believe it when Dad won the Daily Prophet 
Draw. Seven hundred galleons! Most of it’s gone on this trip, 
but they’re going to buy me a new wand for next year. 
 
Harry remembered only too well the occasion when Ron’s old 
wand had snapped. It had happened when the car the two of them 
had been flying to Hogwarts had cr ashed into a tree on the school 
grounds. 
CHAPTER ONE 
 10  
We’ll be back about a week before term starts and we’ll be 
going up to London to get my wand and our new books. Any 
chance of meeting you there? 
Don’t let the Muggles get you down! 
Try and come to London, 
 
 
PS. Percy’s Head Boy. He got the letter last week. 
Harry glanced back at the photograph. Percy, who was in his sev-
enth and final year at Hogwarts, wa s looking particularly smug. He 
had pinned his Head Boy badge to the fez perched jauntily on top of 
his neat hair, his horn-rimmed glasse s flashing in the Egyptian sun. 
Harry now turned to his present and unwrapped it. Inside was 
what looked like a miniature glas s spinning top. There was another 
note from Ron beneath it. 
 
Harry — this is a Pocket Sneakoscope. If there’s someone 
untrustworthy around, it’s supposed to light up and spin. Bill 
says it’s rubbish sold for wizard tourists and isn’t reliable, because it kept lighting up at dinner last night. But he didn ’t realize Fred and George had put beetles in his soup. 
Bye — 
 
 
Harry put the Pocket Sneakoscope on his bedside table, where it 
stood quite still, balanced on it s point, reflecting the luminous 
hands of his clock. He looked at it happily for a fe w seconds, then 
picked up the parcel Hedwig had brought. 
OWL POST 
 11  Inside this, too, there was a wrapped present, a card, and a letter, 
this time from Hermione. 
 
Dear Harry, 
Ron wrote to me and told me about his phone call to your 
Uncle Vernon. I do hope you’re all right. 
I’m on holiday in France at the moment and I didn’t 
know how I was going to send this to you — what if they’d 
opened it at customs? — but then Hedwig turned up! I 
think she wanted to make sure you got something for your 
birthday for a change. I bought your present by owl-order; there was an advertisement in the Daily Prophet (I’ve 
been getting it delivered; it ’s so good to keep up with what ’s going on in the wizarding world). Did you see that picture of Ron and his family a week ag o? I bet he’s learning loads. 
I’m really jealous — the ancient Egyptian wizards were fas-
cinating. 
There’s some interesting local history of witchcraft here, 
too. I’ve rewritten my whole History of Magic essay to include some of the things I’ve found out. I hope it’s not too long — 
it’s two rolls of parchment more than Professor Binns asked for. 
Ron says he ’s going to be in London in the last week of the 
holidays. Can you make it? Will your aunt and uncle let you come? I really hope you can. If no t, I’ll see you on the Hogwarts 
Express on September first! Love from 
Hermonie 
CHAPTER ONE 
 12  PS. Ron says Percy’s Head Boy. I’ll bet Percy’s really pleased. 
Ron doesn’t seem too happy about it. 
 
Harry laughed as he put Hermione’ s letter aside and picked up 
her present. It was very heavy. Knowing Hermione, he was sure it 
would be a large book full of very difficult spells — but it wasn ’ t. 
His heart gave a huge bound as he ripped back the paper and saw a 
sleek black leather case, with silv er words stamped across it, reading 
Broomstick Servicing Kit. 
“Wow, Hermione!” Harry whispered, unzipping the case to look 
inside. 
There was a large jar of Fleetwood ’s High-Finish Handle Polish, 
a pair of gleaming silver Tail-Twig Clippers, a tiny brass compass to 
clip on your broom for long journeys, and a Handbook of Do-It-
Yourself Broomcare. 
Apart from his friends, the th ing that Harry missed most about 
Hogwarts was Quidditch, the most popular sport in the magical world — highly dangerous, very exciting, and played on broom-sticks. Harry happened to be a ve ry good Quidditch player; he had 
been the youngest person in a cent ury to be picked for one of the 
Hogwarts House teams. One of Ha rry’s most prized possessions 
was his Nimbus Two Thou sand racing broom. 
Harry put the leather case aside an d picked up his last parcel. He 
recognized the untidy scrawl on the brown paper at once: this 
was from Hagrid, the Hogwarts ga mekeeper. He to re off the top 
layer of paper and glimpsed something green and leathery, but be-fore he could unwrap it properly, the parcel gave a strange quiver, 
and whatever was inside it snap ped loudly — as though it had 
jaws. 
OWL POST 
 13  Harry froze. He knew that Hagrid would never send him any-
thing dangerous on purpose, but then, Hagrid didn’t have a normal 
person’s view of what was dang erous. Hagrid had been known to 
befriend giant spiders, buy vicious, three-headed dogs from men in 
pubs, and sneak illegal dragon eggs into his cabin. 
Harry poked the parcel n e r v o u s l y . I t s n a p ped loudly again. 
Harry reached for the lamp on his bedside table, gripped it firmly 
in one hand, and raised it over his head, read y to strike. Then he 
seized the rest of the wrapping paper in his other hand and pulled. 
And out fell — a book. Harry just ha d time to register its hand-
some green cover, emblazoned with the golden title The Monster 
Book of Monsters, before it flipped onto its edge and scuttled side-
ways along the bed li ke some weird crab. 
“Uh-oh,” Harry muttered. The book toppled off the bed wi th a loud clunk and shuffled 
rapidly across the room. Harry followe d it stealthily. The book was 
hiding in the dark space under his desk. Praying that the Dursleys were still fast asleep, Harry got down on his hands and knees and 
reached toward it. 
“Ouch!” 
The book snapped shut on his ha nd and then flapped past him, 
still scuttling on its covers. Ha rry scrambled around, threw himself 
forward, and managed to flatten it. Uncle Vernon gave a loud, 
sleepy grunt in the room next door. 
Hedwig and Errol watched inte restedly as Harry clamped the 
struggling book tightly in his arms , hurried to his chest of drawers, 
and pulled out a belt, which he buckled tightly around it. The 
Monster Book shuddered angrily, but could no longer flap and snap, 
so Harry threw it down on the bed and reached for Hagrid’s card. 
CHAPTER ONE 
 14  Dear Harry, 
Happy birthday! Think you might find this useful for next year. Won’t say no more here. Tell you when I see you. Hope the Muggles are treating you right. 
All the best, 
Hagrid 
 
It struck Harry as ominous that Hagrid thought a biting book 
would come in useful, but he put Hagrid’s card up next to Ron’s 
and Hermione’s, grinning more br oadly than ever. Now there was 
only the letter fr om Hogwarts left. 
Noticing that it was rather thic ker than usual, Harry slit open 
the envelope, pulled out the first page of parchment within, and 
read: 
 
Dear Mr. Potter, 
Please note that the new school year will begin on Septem-
ber the first. The Hogwarts Expr ess will leave from King’s Cross 
station, platform nine and thr ee-quarters, at eleven o’clock. 
Third years are permitted to visit the village of Hogsmeade 
on certain weekends. Please give the enclosed permission form 
to your parent or guardian to sign. 
A list of books for ne xt year is enclosed. 
Yours sincerely, 
 
Deputy Headmistress 
OWL POST 
 15  Harry pulled out the Hogsmeade pe rmission form and looked at 
it, no longer grinning. It would be wonderful to visit Hogsmeade 
on weekends; he knew it was an entirely wizarding village, and he 
had never set foot there. But ho w on earth was he going to per-
suade Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia to sign the form? 
He looked over at the alarm cloc k. It was now two o’clock in the 
morning. 
Deciding that he’d worry abou t the Hogsmeade form when he 
woke up, Harry got back into bed and reached up to cross off an-
other day on the char t he’d made for himse lf, counting down the 
days left until his return to Hogwarts. Then he took off his glasses 
and lay down, eyes open, facing his three birthday cards. 
Extremely unusual though he was, at that moment Harry Potter 
felt just like everyone else — glad, for the first time in his life, that 
it was his birthday. 
C H A P T E R T W O 
 
 16  AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 
 
arry went down to breakfast th e next morning to find the 
three Dursleys already sittin g around the kitchen table. 
They were watching a brand-new television, a welcome-home-for-
the-summer present for Dudley, who had been complaining loudly 
about the long walk between the frid ge and the television in the liv-
ing room. Dudley had spent most of the summer in the kitchen, his piggy little eyes fixed on the screen and his five chins wobbling 
as he ate continually. 
Harry sat down between Dudley and Uncle Vernon, a large, 
beefy man with very little neck and a lot of mustache. Far from 
wishing Harry a happy birthday, no ne of the Dursleys made any 
sign that they had noticed Harry enter the room, but Harry was far 
too used to this to care. He help ed himself to a piece of toast and 
then looked up at the reporter on the television, who was halfway 
through a report on an escaped convict: 
“. . . The public is warned that Black is armed and extremely H 
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 17  dangerous. A special hot line has been set up, and any sighting of 
Black should be reported immediately.” 
“No need to tell us he’s no good,” snorted Uncle Vernon, staring 
over the top of his newspaper at the prisoner. “Look at the state of him, the filthy layabout ! Look at his hair!” 
He shot a nasty look sideways at Harry, whose untidy hair had 
always been a source of great annoyance to Uncle Vernon. Com-
pared to the man on the television, however, whose gaunt face was 
surrounded by a matted, elbow-length tangle, Harry felt very well 
groomed indeed. 
The reporter had reappeared. 
“The Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries will announce to-
day —” 
“Hang on!” barked Uncle Vernon, staring furiously at the re-
porter. “You didn’t tell us where that maniac’s escaped from! What 
use is that? Lunatic co uld be coming up the street right now!” 
Aunt Petunia, who was bony an d horse-faced, whipped around 
and peered intently out of the kitchen window. Harry knew Aunt 
Petunia would simply love to be the one to call the hot line num-
ber. She was the nosiest woman in the world and spen t most of her 
life spying on the boring , law-abiding neighbors. 
“When will they learn, ” said Uncle Vernon, pounding the table 
with his large purple fist, “that ha nging’s the only way to deal with 
these people?” 
“Very true,” said Aunt Petunia, who was still squinting into next 
door’s runner beans. 
Uncle Vernon drained his teacup, glanced at his watch, and 
added, “I’d better be off in a minu te, Petunia. Marge’ s train gets in 
at ten.” 
CHAPTER TWO 
 18  Harry, whose thoughts had been upstairs with the Broomstick 
Servicing Kit, was brought back to earth with an unpleasant bump. 
“Aunt Marge?” he blurted out. “Sh — she’s not coming here, is 
she?” 
Aunt Marge was Uncle Vernon’s si ster. Even though she was not 
a blood relative of Harry’s (whose mother had been Aunt Petunia’s 
sister), he had been forced to call her “Aunt” all his life. Aunt 
Marge lived in the country, in a house with a large garden, where 
she bred bulldogs. She didn’t often stay at Privet Drive, because she 
couldn’t bear to leave her precious dogs, but each of her visits stood 
out horribly vividly in Harry’s mind. 
At Dudley’s fifth birthday party, Aunt Marge had whacked 
Harry around the shins with her walking stick to stop him from beating Dudley at musica l statues. A few years later, she had turned 
up at Christmas with a computer ized robot for Dudley and a box 
of dog biscuits for Harry. On her last visit, the year before Harry 
started at Hogwarts, Harry had acci dentally trodden on the tail of 
her favorite dog. Ripper had chased Harry out into the garden and 
up a tree, and Aunt Marge had refu sed to call him off until past 
midnight. The memory of this incident still brought tears of laugh-
ter to Dudley’s eyes. 
“Marge’ll be here for a week,” Uncle Vernon snarled, “and while 
we’re on the subject” — he pointe d a fat finger threateningly at 
Harry — “we need to get a few things straight before I go and col-
lect her.” 
Dudley smirked and withdrew his gaze from the television. 
Watching Harry being bullied by Uncle Vernon was Dudley’s 
favorite form of entertainment. 
 
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 19  “Firstly,” growled Uncle Vernon, “you’ll keep a civil tongue in 
your head when you’re talking to Marge.” 
“All right,” said Harry bitterly, “if she does when she’s talking to 
me.” 
“Secondly,” said Uncle Vernon, acting as though he had not 
heard Harry’s reply, “as Marge doesn’t know anything about your 
abnormality, I don’t want any — any funny stuff while she’s here. 
You behave yourself, got me?” 
“I will if she does,” said Harry through gritted teeth. 
“And thirdly,” said Un cle Vernon, his mean little eyes now slits 
in his great purple face, “we’ve told Marge you attend St. Brutus’s Secure Center for Incu rably Criminal Boys.” 
“What ?” Harry yelled. 
“And you’ll be sticking to that story, boy, or there’ll be trouble,” 
spat Uncle Vernon. 
Harry sat there, white-faced an d furious, staring at Uncle 
Vernon, hardly able to believe it . Aunt Marge coming for a week-
long visit — it was the worst birthday present the Dursleys had 
ever given him, including that pa ir of Uncle Vern on’s old socks. 
“Well, Petunia,” said Uncle Vern on, getting heavily to his feet, 
“I’ll be off to the station, then. Want to come along for the ride, 
Dudders?” 
“No,” said Dudley, wh ose attention had retu rned to the televi-
sion now that Uncle Vernon ha d finished threatening Harry. 
“Duddy’s got to make himself smart for his auntie,” said Aunt 
Petunia, smoothing Dudley’s thick blond hair. “Mummy’s bought 
him a lovely new bow tie.” 
Uncle Vernon clapped Dudley on his pork y shoulder. 
 
CHAPTER TWO 
 20  “See you in a bit, then,” he said, and he left the kitchen. 
Harry, who had been sitting in a kind of horrified trance, had a 
sudden idea. Abandoning his toast, he got quickly to his feet and 
followed Uncle Vernon to the front door. 
Uncle Vernon was pulli ng on his car coat. 
“I’m not taking you,” he snarled as he turned to see Harry watch-
ing him. 
“Like I wanted to come,” said Harry coldly. “I want to ask you 
something.” 
Uncle Vernon eyed him suspiciously. “Third years at Hog — at my sch ool are allowed to visit the vil-
lage sometimes,” said Harry. 
“So?” snapped Uncle Vernon, taking his car keys from a hook 
next to the door. 
“I need you to sign the permission form,” said Harry in a rush. “And why should I do that?” sneered Uncle Vernon. “Well,” said Harry, choosing his wo rds carefully, “it’ll be hard 
work, pretending to Aunt Marge I go to that St. Whatsits —” 
“St. Brutus’s Secure Center fo r Incurably Criminal Boys!” bel-
lowed Uncle Vernon, and Harry was pl eased to hear a definite note 
of panic in Uncle Vernon’s voice. 
“Exactly,” said Harry, looking calmly up into Uncle Vernon’s 
large, purple face. “It’s a lot to re member. I’ll have to make it sound 
convincing, won’t I? What if I ac cidentally let something slip?” 
“You’ll get the stuffing knocked out of you, won’t you ?” roared Un-
cle Vernon, advancing on Harry with his fist raised. But Harry stood his ground. 
“Knocking the stuffing out of me won’t make Aunt Marge for-
get what I could tell her,” he said grimly. 
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 21  Uncle Vernon stopped, his fist still raised, his face an ugly 
puce. 
“But if you sign my permission form,” Harry went on quickly, “I 
swear I’ll remember where I’m supposed to go to school, and I’ll act 
like a Mug — like I’m normal and everything.” 
Harry could tell that Uncle Vernon was thinking it over, even if 
his teeth were bared and a vein was throbbing in his temple. 
“Right,” he snapped finally. “I shall monitor your behavior care-
fully during Marge’s visit. If, at the end of it, you’ve toed the line and kept to the story, I’ll sign your ruddy form.” 
He wheeled around, pulled open the front door, and slammed it 
so hard that one of the little pa nes of glass at the top fell out. 
Harry didn’t return to the kitchen. He went back upstairs to 
his bedroom. If he was going to act like a real Muggle, he’d better start now. Slowly and sadly he gath ered up all his presents and his 
birthday cards and hid them under the loose floorboard with his 
homework. Then he went to Hedwig’s cage. Errol seemed to have 
recovered; he and Hedwig were both asleep, heads under their 
wings. Harry sighed, then poked them both awake. 
“Hedwig,” he said gloomily, “you’r e going to have to clear off for 
a week. Go with Errol. Ron’ll look after you. I’ll write him a note, 
explaining. And don’t look at me like that” — Hedwig’s large am-
ber eyes were reproachful — “it’s not my fault. It’s the only way I’ll be allowed to visit Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione.” 
Ten minutes later, Errol and Hedwig (who had a note to Ron 
bound to her leg) soared out of the window and out of sight. Harry, now feeling thoroughly mise rable, put the empty cage away 
inside the wardrobe. 
But Harry didn’t have long to brood. In next to no time, Aunt 
CHAPTER TWO 
 22  Petunia was shrieking up the stairs for Harry to come down and get 
ready to welcom e their guest. 
“Do something about your hair!” Aunt Petunia snapped as he 
reached the hall. 
Harry couldn’t see the point of tryi ng to make his hair lie flat. 
Aunt Marge loved criticizing him, so the untidier he looked, the 
happier she would be. 
All too soon, there was a crunch of gravel outside as Uncle 
Vernon’s car pulled ba ck into the driveway, then the clunk of the 
car doors and footsteps on the gard en path. 
“Get the door!” Aunt Pe tunia hissed at Harry. 
A feeling of great gloom in his stomach, Harry pulled the door 
open. 
On the threshold stood Aunt Ma rge. She was very like Uncle 
Vernon: large, beefy, and purple -faced, she even had a mustache, 
though not as bushy as his. In o ne hand she held an enormous suit-
case, and tucked under the othe r was an old and evil-tempered 
bulldog. 
“Where’s my Dudders?” roared Aunt Marge. “Where’s my neffy-
poo?” 
Dudley came waddling down the ha ll, his blond hair plastered 
flat to his fat head, a bow tie ju st visible under his many chins. 
Aunt Marge thrust the suitcase in to Harry’s stomach, knocking the 
wind out of him, seized Dudley in a tight one-armed hug, and 
planted a large ki ss on his cheek. 
Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley only put up with Aunt 
Marge’s hugs because he was well paid for it, and sure enough, 
when they broke apart, Dudley had a crisp twenty-pound note 
clutched in his fat fist. 
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 23  “Petunia!” sho uted Aunt Marge, striding past Harry as though 
he was a hat stand. Aunt Marge an d Aunt Petunia kissed, or rather, 
Aunt Marge bumped her large jaw against Aunt Petunia’s bony 
cheekbone. 
Uncle Vernon now came in, smiling jovially as he shut the door. 
“Tea, Marge?” he said. “And what will Ripper take?” 
“Ripper can have some tea out of my saucer,” said Aunt Marge 
as they all proceeded into the ki tchen, leaving Harry alone in the 
hall with the suitca se. But Harry wasn’t complaining; any ex-
cuse not to be with Aunt Marge was fine by him, so he began to heave the case upstairs into the spare bedroom, taking as long as he could. 
By the time he got back to the kitchen, Aunt Marge had been 
supplied with tea and fruitcake, and Ripper was lapping noisily in 
the corner. Harry saw Aunt Petunia wince slightly as specks of tea 
and drool flecked her clean floor. Aunt Petunia hated animals. 
“Who’s looking after the othe r dogs, Marge?” Uncle Vernon 
asked. 
“Oh, I’ve got Colonel Fubster managing them,” boomed Aunt 
Marge. “He’s retired now, good for him to have something to do. But 
I couldn’t leave poor old Ripper. He pines if he’s away from me.” 
Ripper began to growl again as Harry sat down. This directed 
Aunt Marge’s attention to Harry for the first time. 
“So!” she barked. “Still here, are you?” “Yes,” said Harry. 
“Don’t you say ‘yes’ in that ungrateful tone,” Aunt Marge 
growled. “It’s damn good of Vernon and Petunia to keep you. 
Wouldn’t have done it myself. You’ d have gone straight to an or-
phanage if you’d been dumped on my doorstep.” 
CHAPTER TWO 
 24  Harry was bursting to say that he’d rather live in an orphanage 
than with the Dursleys, but the thought of the Hogsmeade form 
stopped him. He forced his face into a painful smile. 
“Don’t you smirk at me!” boomed Aunt Marge. “I can see you 
haven’t improved since I last saw you. I hoped school would knock 
some manners into you.” She took a large gulp of tea, wiped her mustache, and said, “Where is it that you send him, again, 
Vernon?” 
“St. Brutus’s,” said Uncle Vernon promptly. “It’s a first-rate 
institution for ho peless cases.” 
“I see,” said Aunt Marge. “Do they use the cane at St. Brutus’s, 
boy?” she barked ac ross the table. 
“Er —” 
Uncle Vernon nodded curtly behind Aunt Marge’s back. 
“Yes,” said Harry. Then, feeling he might as well do the thing 
properly, he added, “all the time.” 
“Excellent,” said Aunt Marge. “I won’t have this namby-pamby, 
wishy-washy nonsense about not hit ting people who deserve it. A 
good thrashing is what’s needed in ninety-nine cases out of a hun-
dred. Have you been beaten often?” 
“Oh, yeah,” said Har ry, “loads of times.” 
Aunt Marge narrowed her eyes. 
“I still don’t like your tone, bo y,” she said. “If you can speak of 
your beatings in that casual way, they clearly aren’t hitting you hard 
enough. Petunia, I’d write if I were you. Make it clear that you ap-prove the use of extreme fo rce in this boy’s case.” 
Perhaps Uncle Vernon was worried that Harry might forget their 
bargain; in any case, he ch anged the subject abruptly. 
 
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 25  “Heard the news this morning, Marge? What about that escaped 
prisoner, eh?” 
 
As Aunt Marge started to make herself at home, Harry caught him-
self thinking almost longingly of life at number four without her. 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia usually encouraged Harry to stay 
out of their way, which Harry wa s only too happy to do. Aunt 
Marge, on the other hand, wanted Harry under her eye at all times, 
so that she could boom out sugge stions for his improvement. She 
delighted in comparing Harry with Dudley, and took huge plea-
sure in buying Dudley expensive presents while glaring at Harry, as 
though daring him to ask why he hadn’t got a present too. She also 
kept throwing out dark hints ab out what made Harry such an un-
satisfactory person. 
“You mustn’t blame yourself for the way the boy’s turned out, 
Vernon,” she said over lunch on th e third day. “If there’s something 
rotten on the inside, there’s nothing anyone can do about it.” 
Harry tried to concentrate on his food, but his hands shook and 
his face was starting to burn with anger. Remember the form , he told 
himself. Think about Hogsmeade. Don’ t say anything. Don’t rise — 
Aunt Marge reached for her glass of wine. 
“It’s one of the basic rules of breeding,” she said. “You see it all 
the time with dogs. If there’s something wrong with the bitch, there’ll be something wrong with the pup —” 
At that moment, the wineglass Aunt Marge was holding ex-
ploded in her hand. Shards of glass flew in every direction and Aunt Marge sputtered and blinked, her great ruddy face dripping. 
“Marge!” squealed Aunt Petuni a. “Marge, are you all right?” 
 
CHAPTER TWO 
 26  “Not to worry,” grunted Aunt Ma rge, mopping her face with 
her napkin. “Must have squeezed it too hard. Did the same thing 
at Colonel Fubster’s the other day. No need to fuss, Petunia, I have 
a very firm grip . . .” 
But Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon were both looking at Harry 
suspiciously, so he decided he’d better skip dessert and escape from the table as soon as he could. 
Outside in the hall, he leaned ag ainst the wall, breathing deeply. 
It had been a long time since he’d lost control and made something 
explode. He couldn’t afford to let it happen again. The Hogsmeade form wasn’t the only thing at stake — if he carried on like that, he’ d be in trouble with th e Ministry of Magic. 
Harry was still an underage wi zard, and he was forbidden by 
wizard law to do magic outside sc hool. His record wasn’t exactly 
clean either. Only last summer he’d gotten an official warning that had stated quite clearly that if the Ministry got wi nd of any more 
magic in Privet Drive, Harry woul d face expulsion from Hogwarts. 
He heard the Dursleys leaving th e table and hurried upstairs out 
of the way. 
 
Harry got through the next three days by forcing himself to think 
about his Handbook of Do-It-Yourself Broomcare whenever Aunt 
Marge started on him. This worked quite well, though it seemed to 
give him a glazed look, because Aunt Marge started voicing the 
opinion that he was mentally subnormal. 
At last, at long last, the final evening of Marge’s stay arrived. 
Aunt Petunia cooked a fancy di nner and Uncle Vernon uncorked 
several bottles of wine. They got all the way through the soup and 
 
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 27  the salmon without a single mention of Harry’s faults; during the 
lemon meringue pie, Uncle Vernon bored them all with a long talk 
about Grunnings, his drill-maki ng company; then Aunt Petunia 
made coffee and Uncle Vernon brought out a bottle of brandy. 
“Can I tempt you, Marge?” 
Aunt Marge had already had quite a lot of wine. Her huge face 
was very red. 
“Just a small one, then,” she chuckled. “A bit more than 
that . . . and a bit more . . . that’s the ticket.” 
Dudley was eating his fourth slice of pie. Aunt Petunia was sip-
ping coffee with her little finger sticking out. Harry really wanted 
to disappear into his bedroom, bu t he met Uncle Vernon’s angry 
little eyes and knew he wo uld have to sit it out. 
“ A a h , ” s a i d A u n t M a r g e , s m a c k i n g h e r l i p s a n d p u t t i n g t h e 
empty brandy glass back down. “Exc ellent nosh, Petunia. It’s nor-
mally just a fry-up for me of an evening, with twelve dogs to look after. . . .” She burped richly and patted her great tweed stomach. 
“Pardon me. But I do like to see a healthy-sized boy,” she went on, 
winking at Dudley. “You’ll be a proper-sized man, Dudders, like 
your father. Yes, I’ll have a spot more brandy, Vernon. . . .” 
“Now, this one here —” 
She jerked her head at Harry, who felt his stomach clench. The 
Handbook , he thought quickly. 
“This one’s got a mean, runty look about him. You get that with 
dogs. I had Colonel Fubster drown one last year. Ra tty little thing 
it was. Weak. Underbred.” 
Harry was trying to remember page twelve of his book: A 
Charm to Cure Reluctant Reversers. 
 
CHAPTER TWO 
 28  “It all comes down to blood, as I was saying the other day. 
Bad blood will out. Now, I’m sayi ng nothing against your family, 
Petunia” — she patted Aunt Petunia’s bony hand with her shovel-
like one — “but your sister was a bad egg. They turn up in the best 
families. Then she ran off with a wastrel and here’s the result right 
in front of us.” 
Harry was staring at his plate, a funny ringing in his ears. Grasp 
your broom firmly by the tail, he thought. But he couldn’t remember 
what came next. Aunt Marge’s voic e seemed to be boring into him 
like one of Uncle Vernon’s drills. 
“This Potter,” said Aunt Marge lo udly, seizing the brandy bottle 
and splashing more into her glas s and over the tablecloth, “you 
never told me what he did?” 
Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia were looking extremely tense. 
Dudley had even looked up from his pie to gape at his parents. 
“He — didn’t work,” said Uncle Vernon, with half a glance at 
Harry. “Unemployed.” 
“As I expected!” said Aunt Marge, taking a huge swig of brandy 
and wiping her chin on her sleeve. “A no-account, good-for-
nothing, lazy scrounger who —” 
“He was not,” said Harry suddenly. The table went very quiet. 
Harry was shaking all over. He had nev er felt so angry in his life. 
“MORE BRANDY!” yelled Uncle Vernon, who had gone very 
white. He emptied the bottle into Aunt Marge’s glass. “You, boy,” 
he snarled at Harry. “G o to bed, go on —” 
“No, Vernon,” hiccuped Aunt Ma rge, holding up a hand, her 
tiny bloodshot eyes fixed on Harry’s. “Go on, boy, go on. Proud of your parents, are you? They go an d get themselves killed in a car 
crash (drunk, I expect) —” 
AUNT MARGE’S BIG MISTAKE 
 29  “They didn’t die in a car crash! ” said Harry, who found himself 
on his feet. 
“They died in a car crash, you nasty little liar, and left you to 
be a burden on their decent, hardworking relatives!” screamed Aunt 
Marge, swelling with fury. “You are an insolent, ungrateful little —” 
But Aunt Marge suddenly stoppe d speaking. For a moment, it 
looked as though words had failed her. She seemed to be swelling 
with inexpressible anger — but the swelling didn’t stop. Her great 
red face started to expand, her tiny eyes bulged, and her mouth 
stretched too tightly for speech — next second, several buttons had 
just burst from her tweed jacket and pinged off the walls — she 
was inflating like a monstrous balloon, her stomach bursting free of her tweed waistband, each of her fingers blowing up like a 
salami — 
“MARGE!” yelled Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia together as 
Aunt Marge’s whole body began to rise off her chair toward the 
ceiling. She was entirely round, now, like a vast life buoy with piggy 
eyes, and her hands and feet stuck ou t weirdly as she drifted up into 
the air, making apoplectic popp ing noises. Ripper came skidding 
into the room, barking madly. 
“NOOOOOOO!” Uncle Vernon seized one of Marge’s feet and tried to pull her 
down again, but was almost lifted from the floor himself. A second 
later, Ripper leapt forward and sank his teeth into Uncle Vernon’s 
leg. 
Harry tore from the dining room before anyone could stop him, 
heading for the cupboard under the stairs. The cupboard door 
burst magically open as he reached it . In seconds, he had heaved his 
trunk to the front door. He sprint ed upstairs and threw himself 
CHAPTER TWO 
 30  under the bed, wrenching up the loose floorboard, and grabbed the 
pillowcase full of his books and birt hday presents. He wriggled out, 
seized Hedwig’s empty cage, and dashed back downstairs to his 
trunk, just as Uncle Vernon burst out of the dining room, his trouser leg in bloody tatters. 
“COME BACK IN HERE!” he bellowed. “COME BACK 
AND PUT HER RIGHT!” 
But a reckless rage had come ov er Harry. He kicked his trunk 
open, pulled out his wand, and pointed it at Uncle Vernon. 
“She deserved it,” Harry said, br eathing very fast. “She deserved 
what she got. You ke ep away from me.” 
He fumbled behind him fo r the latch on the door. 
“I’m going,” Harry said. “I’ve had enough.” 
And in the next mome nt, he was out in th e dark, quiet street, 
heaving his heavy trunk behind him, Hedwig’s cage under his arm. 
C H A P T E R T H R E E 
 
 31  THE KNIGHT BUS 
 
 
 
arry was several streets away before he collapsed onto a low wall in Magnolia Cresce nt, panting from the effort 
of dragging his trunk. He sat quite still, anger still surging through 
him, listening to the frantic thumping of his heart. 
But after ten minutes alone in the dark street, a new emotion 
overtook him: panic. Whichever wa y he looked at it, he had never 
been in a worse fix. He was strand ed, quite alone, in the dark Mug-
gle world, with absolutely nowhere to go. And the worst of it was, he had just done serious magic, which meant that he was almost 
certainly expelled from Hogwarts . He had broken the Decree for 
the Restriction of Underage Wizardry so badly, he was surprised Ministry of Magic representatives weren’t swooping down on him 
where he sat. 
Harry shivered and looked up and down Magnolia Crescent. 
What was going to happen to him? Would he be arrested, or would 
 H 
CHAPTER THREE 
 32  he simply be outlawed from the wizarding world? He thought of 
Ron and Hermione, and his heart sank even lower. Harry was sure 
that, criminal or not, Ron and Hermione would want to help him now, but they were both abroad, and with Hedwig gone, he had no 
means of contacting them. 
He didn’t have any Muggle money, either. There was a little wiz-
ard gold in the money bag at the bo ttom of his trunk, but the rest 
of the fortune his parents had left him was stored in a vault at 
Gringotts Wizarding Bank in London. He’d never be able to drag 
his trunk all the way to London. Unless . . . 
He looked down at his wand, whic h he was still clutching in his 
hand. If he was already expelle d (his heart was now thumping 
painfully fast), a bit more magic couldn’t hurt. He had the Invisi-
bility Cloak he had inherited from his father — what if he 
bewitched the trunk to make it feat her-light, tied it to his broom-
stick, covered himself in the cloa k, and flew to London? Then he 
could get the rest of his money out of his vault and . . . begin his 
life as an outcast. It was a horrible prospect, but he couldn ’ t sit on 
this wall forever, or he’d find hi mself trying to explain to Muggle 
police why he was out in the dead of night with a trunkful of spell-
books and a broomstick. 
Harry opened his trunk again an d pushed the contents aside, 
looking for the Invisibility Cloak — but before he had found it, he 
straightened up suddenly, lo oking around him once more. 
A funny prickling on the back of his neck had made Harry feel 
he was being watched, but the stre et appeared to be deserted, and 
no lights shone from any of the large square houses. 
He bent over his trunk again, but almost imme diately stood up 
once more, his hand clenched on his wand. He had sensed rather 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 33  than heard it: someone or someth ing was standing in the narrow 
gap between the garage and the fe nce behind him. Harry squinted 
at the black alleyway. If only it would move, then he’d know 
whether it was just a stray cat or — something else. 
“Lumos, ” Harry muttered, and a light a ppeared at the end of his 
wand, almost dazzling him. He held it high over his head, and the 
pebble-dashed walls of number two suddenly sparkled; the garage 
door gleamed, and between them Ha rry saw, quite distinctly, the 
hulking outline of something very big, with wide, gleaming eyes. 
Harry stepped backward. His legs hit his trunk and he tripped. 
His wand flew out of his hand as he flung out an arm to break his 
fall, and he landed, ha rd, in the gutter — 
There was a deafening BANG, and Harry threw up his hands to 
shield his eyes against a sudden blinding light — 
With a yell, he rolled back onto the pavement, just in time. A 
second later, a gigantic pair of wh eels and headlights screeched to a 
halt exactly where Ha rry had just been lying. They belonged, as 
Harry saw when he raised his head, to a triple-decker, violently 
purple bus, which had appeared out of thin air. Gold lettering over 
the windshield spelled The Knight Bus. 
For a split second, Harry wondered if he had been knocked silly 
by his fall. Then a conductor in a purple uniform leapt out of the 
bus and began to speak loudly to the night. 
“Welcome to the Knight Bus, emergency transport for the 
stranded witch or wizard. Just st ick out your wand hand, step on 
board, and we can take you anywhe re you want to go. My name is 
Stan Shunpike, and I will be your conductor this eve —” 
The conductor stopped abruptly. He had just caught sight of 
Harry, who was still sitting on th e ground. Harry snatched up his 
CHAPTER THREE 
 34  wand again and scrambled to his feet. Close up, he saw that Stan 
Shunpike was only a few years older than he was, eighteen or nine-
teen at most, with large, protrudi ng ears and quite a few pimples. 
“What were you doin’ down there? ” said Stan, dropping his pro-
fessional manner. 
“Fell over,” said Harry. “ ’Choo fall over for?” sniggered Stan. 
“I didn’t do it on purpose,” said Harry, annoyed. One of the 
knees in his jeans was torn, and the hand he had thrown out to break his fall was bleeding. He suddenly remembered why he had 
fallen over and turned around quic kly to stare at the alleyway be-
tween the garage and fence. The Knight Bus’s headlamps were 
flooding it with light, and it was empty. 
“ ’Choo lookin’ at?” said Stan. 
“There was a big black thing,” said Harry, pointing uncertainly 
into the gap. “Like a dog . . . but massive . . .” 
He looked around at Stan, whose mouth was slightly open. 
With a feeling of unease, Harry saw Stan’s eyes move to the scar on 
Harry’s forehead. 
“Woss that on your ’ead ?” said Stan abruptly. 
“Nothing,” said Harry quickly, flattening his hair over his scar. If 
the Ministry of Magic wa s looking for him, he didn’t want to make 
it too easy for them. 
“Woss your name?” Stan persisted. 
“Neville Longbottom,” said Harr y, saying the first name that 
came into his head. “So — so this bus,” he went on quickly, hop-
ing to distract Stan, “did you say it goes anywhere ?” 
“Yep,” said Stan proudly, “anywhere you like, long’s it’s on land. 
Can’t do nuffink underwater. ’Ere,” he said, looking suspicious 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 35  again, “you did flag us down, dincha? Stuck out your wand ’and, 
dincha?” 
“Yes,” said Harry quickly. “Listen, how much would it be to get 
to London?” 
“Eleven Sickles,” said Stan, “but for firteen you get ’ot chocolate, 
and for fifteen you get an ’ot water bottle an’ a toofbrush in the 
color of your choice.” 
Harry rummaged once more in his trunk, extracted his money 
bag, and shoved some gold into Stan’s hand. He and Stan then 
lifted his trunk, with Hedwig’ s cage balanced on top, up the steps 
of the bus. 
There were no seats; instead, half a dozen bra ss bedsteads stood 
beside the curtained windows. Candles were burnin g in brackets 
beside each bed, illuminating th e wood-paneled walls. A tiny wiz-
ard in a nightcap at the rear of the bus muttered, “Not now, thanks, 
I’m pickling some slugs” an d rolled over in his sleep. 
“You ’ave this one,” Stan whis pered, shoving Harry’s trunk un-
der the bed right behind the driver, who was sitting in an armchair 
in front of the steering wheel. “This is our driver, Ernie Prang. This 
is Neville Longbottom, Ern.” 
Ernie Prang, an elderly wizard wearing very thick glasses, nod-
ded to Harry, who nervously flat tened his bangs again and sat 
down on his bed. 
“Take ’er away, Ern,” said Stan, sitting do wn in the armchair 
next to Ernie’s. 
There was another tremendous BANG, and the next moment 
Harry found himself flat on his bed, thrown backward by the 
speed of the Knight Bu s. Pulling himself up, Harry stared out of 
the dark window and saw that they were now bowling along a 
CHAPTER THREE 
 36  completely different street. Stan was watching Harry’s stunned face 
with great enjoyment. 
“This is where we was before you flagged us down,” he said. 
“Where are we, Ern? Somewhere in Wales?” 
“Ar,” said Ernie. 
“How come the Muggles don’t hear the bus?” said Harry. 
“Them!” said Stan contemptuous ly. “Don’ listen properly, do 
they? Don’ look properly either. Never notice nuffink, they don’.” 
“Best go w ake up M a dam M arsh , Stan, ” sa i d Ern. “We ’ll be in 
Abergavenny in a minute.” 
Stan passed Harry’s bed and di sappeared up a narrow wooden 
staircase. Harry was still lookin g out of the window, feeling in-
creasingly nervous. Ernie didn’t seem to have mastered the use of a steering wheel. The Knight Bus kept mounting the pavement, but 
it didn’t hit anything; lines of la mpposts, mailboxes, and trash cans 
jumped out of its way as it approa ched and back into position once 
it had passed. 
Stan came back downstairs, followed by a faintly green witch 
wrapped in a traveling cloak. 
“ ’Ere you go, Madam Marsh,” said Stan happily as Ern stamped 
on the brake and the beds slid a f oot or so toward the front of the 
bus. Madam Marsh clamped a hand kerchief to her mouth and tot-
tered down the steps. Stan threw her bag out after her and rammed 
the doors shut; there wa s another loud BANG, and they were thun-
dering down a narrow country lane , trees leaping out of the way. 
Harry wouldn’t have been able to sleep even if he had been trav-
eling on a bus that didn’t keep banging loudly and jumping a hun-
dred miles at a time. His stomac h churned as he fell back to 
 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 37  wondering what was going to happen to him, and whether the 
Dursleys had managed to get Au nt Marge off the ceiling yet. 
Stan had unfurled a copy of the Daily Prophet and was now read-
ing with his tongue between his t eeth. A large photograph of a 
sunken-faced man with long, matted hair blinked slowly at Harry 
from the front page. He looked strangely familiar. 
“That man!” Harry said, forgetting his troubles for a moment. 
“He was on the Muggle news!” 
Stanley turned to the fr ont page and chuckled. 
“Sirius Black,” he said, nodding. “ ’Course ’e was on the Muggle 
news, Neville, where you been?” 
He gave a superior sort of chuc kle at the blank look on Harry’s 
face, removed the front page, and handed it to Harry. 
“You oughta read the papers more, Neville.” 
Harry held the paper up to the candleli ght and read: 
 
BLACK STILL AT LARGE 
Sirius Black, possibly the most infamous prisoner 
ever to be held in Azkaba n fortress, is still eluding 
capture, the Ministry of Magic confirmed today. 
“We are doing all we can to recapture Black,” 
said the Minister of Magi c, Cornelius Fudge, this 
morning, “and we beg the magical community to remain calm.” 
Fudge has been criticized by some members of 
the International Federation of Warlocks for in-forming the Muggle Prime Minister of the crisis. 
“Well, really, I had to, don ’t you know,” said an 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 38  irritable Fudge. “Black is mad. He’s a danger to 
anyone who crosses him, magic or Muggle. I have 
the Prime Minister’s assurance that he will not breathe a word of Black’s true identity to anyone. 
And let’s face it — who’d believe him if he did?” 
While Muggles have been told that Black is car-
rying a gun (a kind of metal wand that Muggles use to kill each other), the magical community lives in 
fear of a massacre like that of twelve years ago, when 
Black murdered thirteen people with a single curse. 
 
Harry looked into the shadowed ey es of Sirius Black, the only 
part of the sunken face that se emed alive. Harry had never met a 
vampire, but he had se en pictures of them in his Defense Against 
the Dark Arts classes, and Black, with his waxy white skin, looked 
just like one. 
“Scary-lookin’ fing, inee?” said Stan, who had been watching 
Harry read. 
“He murdered thirteen people ?” said Harry, handing the page 
back to Stan, “with one curse ?” 
“Yep,” said Stan, “in front of wi tnesses an’ all. Broad daylight. 
Big trouble it caus ed, dinnit, Ern?” 
“Ar,” said Ern darkly. Stan swiveled in his armchair, hi s hands on the back, the better 
to look at Harry. 
“Black woz a big supporter of You-Know-’Oo,” he said. “What, Voldemort?” said Harry, without thinking. 
Even Stan’s pimples went white; Ern jerked the steering wheel 
 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 39  so hard that a whole farmhouse had to jump aside to avoid the 
bus. 
“You outta your tree?” yelped Stan. “ ’Choo say ’is name for?” 
“Sorry,” said Harry hastily. “Sorry, I — I forgot —” 
“Forgot!” said Stan weakly. “B limey, my ’eart’s goin’ that 
fast . . .” 
“So — so Black was a supporter of You-Know-Who?” Harry 
prompted apologetically. 
“Yeah,” said Stan, still rubbing his chest. “Yeah, that’s right. Very 
close to You-Know-’Oo, they say. Anyway, when little ’Arry Potter got the better of You-Know-’Oo —” 
Harry nervously flattened his bangs down again. 
“— all You-Know-’Oo’s supporters was tracked down, wasn’t 
they, Ern? Most of ’em knew it was all over, wiv You-Know-
’Oo gone, and they came quiet. Bu t not Sirius Black. I ’eard he 
thought ’e’d be second-in-command once You-Know-’Oo ’ad taken over. 
“Anyway, they cornered Black in the middle of a street full of 
Muggles an’ Black took out ’is wand and ’e blasted ’alf the street 
apart, an’ a wizard go t it, an’ so did a dozen Muggles what got in 
the way. ’Orrible, eh? An’ you kn ow what Black did then?” Stan 
continued in a dramatic whisper. 
“What?” said Harry. 
“Laughed ,” said Stan. “Jus’ stood there an’ laughed. An’ when re-
inforcements from the Ministry of Magic got there, ’e went wiv 
’em quiet as anyfink, still laughing ’is ’ead off. ’Cos ’e’s mad, inee, 
Ern? Inee mad?” 
“If he weren’t when he went to Az kaban, he will be now,” said 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 40  Ern in his slow voice. “I’ d blow meself up before I set foot in that 
place. Serves him right, mind you . . . after what he did. . . .” 
“They ’ad a job coverin’ it up, din’ they, Ern?” Stan said. “ ’Ole 
street blown up an’ all them Muggl es dead. What was it they said 
’ad ’appened, Ern?” 
“Gas explosion,” grunted Ernie. 
“An’ now ’e’s out,” said Stan, examining the newspaper pic-
ture of Black’s gaunt face agai n. “Never been a breakout from 
Azkaban before, ’as there, Ern? Be ats me ’ow ’e did it. Frightenin’, 
eh? Mind, I don’t fanc y ’is chances against them Azkaban guards, 
eh, Ern?” 
Ernie suddenly shivered. 
“Talk about summat else, Stan, th ere’s a good lad. Them Azka-
ban guards give me the collywobbles.” 
Stan put the paper away reluctan tly, and Harry leaned against 
the window of the Knight Bus, feel ing worse than ever. He couldn’t 
help imagining what Stan might be telling his passengers in a few nights’ time. 
“ ’Ear about that ’Arry Potter? Blew up ’is aunt! We ’ad ’im 
’ere on the Knight Bus, di’ n ’ t we , Ern? ’E was tryin’ to run for 
it. . . .” 
He, Harry, had broken wizard law ju st like Sirius Black. Was in-
flating Aunt Marge bad enough to land him in Azkaban? Harry 
didn’t know anything about the wizard prison, though everyone he’d ever heard speak of it did so in the same fearful tone. Hagrid, 
the Hogwarts gamekeeper, had spent two months there only last 
year. Harry wouldn’t soon forget th e look of terror on Hagrid’s face 
when he had been told where he wa s going, and Hagrid was one of 
the bravest people Harry knew. 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 41  The Knight Bus rolled through the darkness, scattering bushes 
and wastebaskets, telephone booths and trees, and Harry lay, 
restless and miserable, on his feather bed. After a while, Stan remembered that Harry had paid fo r hot chocolate, but poured it 
all over Harry’s pillow when the bus moved abruptly from Angle-sey to Aberdeen. One by one, wi zards and witches in dressing 
gowns and slippers descended from the upper floors to leave the 
bus. They all looked very pleased to go. 
Finally, Harry was the only passenger left. 
“Right then, Neville,” said Stan , clapping his hands, “where-
abouts in London?” 
“Diagon Alley,” said Harry. 
“Righto,” said Stan. “ ’Ol d tight, then . . .” 
BANG! They were thundering along Ch aring Cross Road. Harry sat up 
and watched buildings and benches squeezing themselves out of 
the Knight Bus’s way. The sky was ge tting a little lighter. He would 
lie low for a couple of hours, go to Gringotts the moment it 
opened, then set off — where, he didn’t know. 
Ern slammed on the brakes and the Knight Bus skidded to a halt 
in front of a small and shabby-l ooking pub, the Leaky Cauldron, 
behind which lay the magical en trance to Diagon Alley. 
“Thanks,” Harry said to Ern. He jumped down the steps and he lped Stan lower his trunk and 
Hedwig’s cage onto the pavement. 
“Well,” said Harry. “ ’Bye then!” But Stan wasn’t paying attention. Still standing in the doorway 
to the bus, he was goggling at th e shadowy entrance to the Leaky 
Cauldron. 
CHAPTER THREE 
 42  “There you are, Harry,” said a voice. 
Before Harry could turn, he felt a hand on his shoulder. At the 
same time, Stan shouted, “Bli mey! Ern, come ’ere! Come ’ere!” 
Harry looked up at the owner of the hand on his shoulder and 
felt a bucketful of ice cascade into his stomach — he had walked 
right into Cornelius Fudge, th e Minister of Magic himself. 
Stan leapt onto the pavement beside them. 
“What didja call Neville, Minister?” he said excitedly. 
Fudge, a portly little man in a long, pinstriped cloak, looked 
cold and exhausted. 
“Neville?” he repeated, frow ning. “This is Harry Potter.” 
“I knew it!” Stan shouted gleefu lly. “Ern! Ern! Guess ’oo Neville 
is, Ern! ’E’s ’Arry Pott er! I can see ’is scar!” 
“Yes,” said Fudge testily, “well, I’m very glad the Knight Bus 
picked Harry up, but he and I need to step inside the Leaky Caul-
dron now . . .” 
Fudge increased the pressure on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry 
found himself being steered inside the pub. A stooping figure bear-
ing a lantern appeared through th e door behind th e bar. It was 
Tom, the wizened, toothless landlord. 
“You’ve got him, Minist er!” said Tom. “Will you be wanting 
anything? Beer? Brandy?” 
“Perhaps a pot of tea,” said Fudge, who still hadn’t let go of 
Harry. 
There was a loud scraping and puffing from behind them, and 
Stan and Ern appeared, carrying Ha rry’s trunk and Hedwig’s cage 
and looking around excitedly. 
“ ’Ow come you di’n’t tell us ’oo you are, eh, Neville?” said Stan, 
 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 43  beaming at Harry, while Ernie’s owlish face peered in terestedly over 
Stan’s shoulder. 
“And a private parlor, please, Tom,” said Fudge pointedly. 
“ ’Bye,” Harry said miserably to Stan and Ern as Tom beckoned 
Fudge toward the passage that led from the bar. 
“ ’Bye, Neville!” called Stan. 
Fudge marched Harry along the narrow passage after Tom’s 
lantern, and then into a small parlor. Tom clicked his fingers, a fire burst into life in the grate, and he bowed himself out of the room. 
“Sit down, Harry,” said Fudge, indicating a chair by the fire. Harry sat down, feeling goose bumps rising up his arms despite 
the glow of the fire. Fudge took o ff his pinstriped cloak and tossed 
it aside, then hitched up the trousers of his bottle-green suit and sat down opposite Harry. 
“I am Cornelius Fudge, Har ry. The Minister of Magic.” 
Harry already knew this, of course; he had seen Fudge once be-
fore, but as he had been wearing hi s father’s Invisibility Cloak at 
the time, Fudge wasn ’t to know that. 
Tom the innkeeper reappeared, we aring an apron over his night-
shirt and bearing a tray of tea and crumpets. He placed the tray on 
a table between Fudge and Harry and left the parl or, closing the 
door behind him. 
“Well, Harry,” said Fudge, pouring out tea, “you’ve had us all in 
a right flap, I don’t mind telling yo u. Running away from your aunt 
and uncle’s house like that! I’d started to think . . . but you’re safe, 
and that’s what matters.” 
Fudge buttered himself a crumpet and pushed the plate toward 
Harry. 
CHAPTER THREE 
 44  “Eat, Harry, you look dead on your feet. Now then . . . You 
will be pleased to hear that we have dealt with the unfortunate 
blowing-up of Miss Marjorie Dursley. Two members of the Ac-
cidental Magic Reversal Squad we re dispatched to Privet Drive 
a few hours ago. Miss Dursley has been punctured and her memory has been modified. She has no recolle ction of the incident at all. So 
that’s that, and no harm done.” 
Fudge smiled at Harry over the ri m of his teacup, rather like an 
uncle surveying a favorite nephew. Harry, who couldn’t believe his 
ears, opened his mouth to speak, couldn’t think of anything to say, and closed it again. 
“Ah, you’re worrying about the reaction of your aunt and un-
cle?” said Fudge. “Well, I won’t deny that they are extremely angry, Harry, but they are prepared to ta ke you back next summer as long 
as you stay at Hogwar ts for the Christmas an d Easter holidays.” 
Harry unstuck his throat. “I always stay at Hogwarts for the Christmas and Easter holi-
days,” he said, “and I don’t ever wa nt to go back to Privet Drive.” 
“Now, now, I’m sure you’ll feel differently once you’ve calmed 
down,” said Fudge in a worried to ne. “They are your family, after 
all, and I’m sure you are fond of each other — er — very deep 
down.” 
It didn’t occur to Harry to put Fudge right. He was still waiting 
to hear what was going to happen to him now. 
“So all that remains,” said Fudg e, now buttering himself a sec-
ond crumpet, “is to decide where yo u’re going to spend the last three 
weeks of your vacation. I suggest yo u take a room here at the Leaky 
Cauldron and —” 
 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 45  “Hang on,” blurted Harry. “W hat about my punishment?” 
Fudge blinked. 
“Punishment?” “I broke the law!” Harry said. “T he Decree for the Restriction of 
Underage Wizardry!” 
“ O h , m y d e a r b o y , w e ’ r e n o t g o i n g t o p u n i s h y o u f o r a l i t t l e 
thing like that!” crie d Fudge, waving his crumpet impatiently. “It 
was an accident! We don’t send pe ople to Azkaban just for blowing 
up their aunts!” 
But this didn’t tally at all with Harry’s past dealings with the 
Ministry of Magic. 
“Last year, I got an official wa rning just because a house-elf 
smashed a pudding in my uncle’s ho use!” he told Fudge, frowning. 
“The Ministry of Magic sa id I’d be expelled from Hogwarts if there 
was any more magic there!” 
Unless Harry’s eyes were deceiving him, Fudge was suddenly 
looking awkward. 
“Circumstances change, Harry. . . . We have to take into ac-
count . . . in the present climate . . . Surely you don’t want to be ex-
pelled?” 
“Of course I don’t,” said Harry. “Well then, what’s all the fuss about?” laughed Fudge. “Now, 
have a crumpet, Harry, while I go and see if Tom’s got a room for 
you.” 
Fudge strode out of the parlor and Harry stared after him. There 
was something extremely odd going on. Why had Fudge been waiting for him at the Leaky Caul dron, if not to punish him for 
what he’d done? And now Harry came to think of it, surely it wasn’t 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 46  usual for the Minister of Magic himself to get involved in matters of 
underage magic? 
Fudge came back, accompanie d by Tom the innkeeper. 
“Room eleven’s free, Harry,” said Fudge. “I think you’ll be very 
comfortable. Just one thing, and I’m sure you’ll understand . . . I 
don’t want you wandering off into Muggle London, all right? Keep 
to Diagon Alley. And you’re to be back here before dark each night. 
Sure you’ll understand. Tom will be keeping an eye on you for me.” 
“Okay,” said Harry slowly, “but why — ?” 
“Don’t want to lose you again, do we?” said Fudg e with a hearty 
laugh. “No, no . . . best we know where you are. . . . I mean . . .” 
Fudge cleared his throat loudly and picked up his pinstriped 
cloak. 
“Well, I’ll be off, plenty to do, you know. . . .” 
“Have you had any luck with Black yet?” Harry asked. 
Fudge’s finger slipped on the si lver fastenings of his cloak. 
“What’s that? Oh, you’ve heard — well, no, not yet, but it’s only 
a matter of time. The Azkaban guards have never yet failed . . . and 
they are angrier than I’ ve ever seen them.” 
Fudge shuddered slightly. 
“So, I’ll say good-bye.” 
He held out his hand and Harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea. 
“Er — Minister? Can I ask you something?” 
“Certainly,” said Fudge with a smile. 
“Well, third years at Hogwarts are allowed to visit Hogsmeade, 
but my aunt and uncl e didn’t sign the permission form. D’you 
think you could — ?” 
Fudge was looking uncomfortable. 
 
THE KNIGHT BUS 
 47  “Ah,” he said. “No, no, I’m very so rry, Harry, but as I’m not your 
parent or guardian —” 
“But you’re the Minister of Magi c,” said Harry eagerly. “If you 
gave me permission —” 
“No, I’m sorry, Harry, but rules are rules,” said Fudge flatly. 
“ P e r h a p s y o u ’ l l b e a b l e t o v i s i t H o g s m e a d e n e x t y e a r . I n f a c t , I 
think it’s best if you don’t . . . yes . . . well, I’ll be off. Enjoy your 
stay, Harry.” 
And with a last smile and shake of Harry’s hand, Fudge left the 
room. Tom now moved forwar d, beaming at Harry. 
“If you’ll follow me, Mr. Potter ,” he said, “I’ve already taken 
your things up. . . .” 
Harry followed Tom up a handsome wooden staircase to a door 
with a brass number eleven on it, which Tom unlocked and opened 
for him. 
Inside was a very comfortable-looking bed, some highly pol-
ished oak furniture, a cheerfully crackling fire and, perched on top of the wardrobe — 
“Hedwig!” Harry gasped. 
The snowy owl clicked her be ak and fluttered down onto 
Harry’s arm. 
“Very smart owl you’ve got there,” chuckled Tom. “Arrived 
about five minutes after you did. If there’s anything you need, Mr. 
Potter, don’t hesitate to ask.” 
He gave another bow and left. 
Harry sat on his bed for a long time, absentmindedly stroking 
Hedwig. The sky outside the win dow was changing rapidly from 
deep, velvety blue to cold , steely gray and then, slowly, to pink shot 
 
CHAPTER THREE 
 48  with gold. Harry could hardly beli eve that he’d left Privet Drive 
only a few hours ago, that he wasn ’t expelled, and that he was now 
facing three Durs ley-free weeks. 
“It’s been a very weird night, Hedwig,” he yawned. 
And witho ut even remo ving his glasses, he slumped back o nto 
his pillows and fell asleep. 
C H A P T E R F O U R 
 
 49  THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 
 
 
t took Harry several days to get used to his strange new freedom. Never before had he been able to get up whenever he wanted 
or eat whatever he fancied. He co uld even go wherever he pleased, 
as long as it was in Diagon Alley, and as this long cobbled street was 
packed with the most fascinating wizarding shops in the world, 
Harry felt no desire to break his word to Fudge and stray back into 
the Muggle world. 
Harry ate breakfast each morning in the Leaky Cauldron, where 
he liked watching the other guests: funny little witches from the 
country, up for a day’s shopping; venerable-looking wizards argu-
ing over the latest article in Transfiguration Today ; wild-looking 
warlocks; raucous dwarfs; and once, what looked suspiciously like 
a hag, who ordered a plate of raw liver from behind a thick woollen 
balaclava. 
After breakfast Harry would go out into the backyard, take out 
 I 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 50  his wand, tap the third brick from the left above the trash bin, 
and stand back as the archway into Diagon Alley opened in the 
wall. 
Harry spent the long sunny days exploring the shops and eating 
under the brightly colored umbrellas outside cafes, where his fellow diners were showing one another thei r purchases (“it’s a lunascope, 
old boy — no more messing around with moon charts, see?”) or 
else discussing the case of Sirius Black (“personally, I won’t let any 
of the children out alone until he’s back in Azkaban”). Harry didn’t 
have to do his homework under the blankets by flashlight any-
more; now he could sit in the bright sunshine outside Florean 
Fortescue’s Ice Cream Parlor, finishin g all his essays with occasional 
help from Florean Fortescue hims elf, who, apart from knowing a 
great deal about medieval witch burnings, gave Harry free sundaes 
every half an hour. 
Once Harry had refilled his mone y bag with gold Galleons, sil-
ver Sickles, and bronze Knuts from his vault at Gringotts, he had to 
exercise a lot of self-control not to spend the whole lot at once. He 
had to keep reminding himself that he had five years to go at Hog-
warts, and how it would feel to ask the Dursleys for money for 
spellbooks, to stop himself from buying a handsome set of solid 
gold Gobstones (a wizarding game rather like marbles, in which 
the stones squirt a nasty-smelling li quid into the other player’s face 
when they lose a point). He was sorely tempted, too, by the perfect, 
moving model of the galaxy in a large glass ball, which would have 
meant he never had to take another Astronomy lesson. But the thing that tested Harry’s resolution most appeared in his favorite 
shop, Quality Quidditch Supplies, a week after he’d arrived at the 
Leaky Cauldron. 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 51  Curious to know what the crow d in the shop was staring at, 
Harry edged his way inside and sq ueezed in among the excited 
witches and wizards until he glimpsed a newly erected podium, on 
which was mounted the most magn ificent broom he had ever seen 
in his life. 
“Just come out — prototype —” a square-jawed wizard was 
telling his companion. 
“It’s the fastest broom in the world, isn’t it, Dad?” squeaked a 
boy younger than Harry, who was swinging off his father’s arm. 
“Irish International Side’s just put in an order for seven of these 
beauties!” the proprietor of the shop told the crowd. “And they’re favorites for the World Cup!” 
A large witch in front of Harry mo ved, and he was able to read 
the sign next to the broom: 
 
THE FIREBOLT 
THIS STATE -OF-THE-ART RACING BROOM SPORTS A STREAM -
LINED , SUPERFINE HANDLE OF ASH , TREATED WITH A

AND PINPOINT PRECISION . THE FIREBOLT HAS AN ACCELERATION 
OF 150 MILES AN HOUR IN TEN SECONDS AND INCORPORATES 
AN UNBREAKABLE BRAKING CHARM. PRICE ON REQUEST . 
 
Price on request . . . Harry didn’t like to think how much gold the 
Firebolt would cost. He had never wanted anything as much in his 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 52  whole life — but he had never lo st a Quidditch match on his Nim-
bus Two Thousand, and what wa s the point in emptying his 
Gringotts vault for the Firebolt, when he had a very good broom 
already? Harry didn’t ask for the price, but he returned, almost 
every day after that , just to look at the Firebolt. 
There were, however, things that Harry needed to buy. He went 
to the Apothecary to replenish hi s store of potions ingredients, 
and as his school robe s were now several inches too short in the 
arm and leg, he visited Madam Malkin’s Robes for All Occasions and 
bought new ones. Most important of all, he had to buy his new 
schoolbooks, which would include those for his two new subjects, 
Care of Magical Crea tures and Divination. 
Harry got a surprise as he looked in at the bookshop window. 
Instead of the usual display of go ld-embossed spellbooks the size of 
paving slabs, there was a large iron cage behind the glass that held about a hundred copies of The Monster Book of Monsters. Torn 
pages were flying everywhere as the books grappled with each 
other, locked together in furiou s wrestling matches and snapping 
aggressively. 
Harry pulled his bookli st out of his pocket and consulted it for 
the first time. The Monster Book of Monsters was listed as the re-
quired book for Care of Magical Creatures. Now Harry under-
stood why Hagrid had said it w o u l d c o m e i n u s e f u l . H e f e l t 
relieved; he had been wondering wh ether Hagrid wanted help with 
some terrifying new pet. 
As Harry entered Flourish and Blotts, the manager came hurry-
ing toward him. 
“Hogwarts?” he said abruptly. “Come to get your new books?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, “I need —” 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 53  “Get out of the way,” said the manager impatiently, brushing 
H a r r y a s i d e . H e d r e w o n a p a i r o f v e r y t h i c k g l o v e s , p i c k e d u p a 
large, knobbly walking stick, and proceeded toward the door of the 
Monster Books’ cage. 
“Hang on,” said Harry quickly, “I’ve already got one of those.” “Have you?” A look of enormous re lief spread over the manager’s 
face. “Thank heavens for that. I’ve been bitten five times already 
this morning —” 
A loud ripping noise rent the air; two of the Monster Books had 
seized a third and were pulling it apart. 
“Stop it! Stop it!” cried the manager, poking the walking stick 
through the bars and knocking the books apart. “I’m never stocking 
them again, never! It’s been bedlam ! I thought we’d seen the worst 
when we bought two hundred copies of the Invisible Book of Invisi-
bility — cost a fortune, and we never found them. . . . Well . . . is 
there anything else I can help you with?” 
“Yes,” said Harry, looking down his booklist, “I need Unfogging 
the Future by Cassandra Vablatsky.” 
“Ah, starting Divination, are yo u?” said the manager, stripping 
off his gloves and leading Harry into the back of the shop, where 
there was a corner devoted to fortune-telling. A small table was 
stacked with volumes such as Predicting the Unpredictable: Insulate 
Yourself Against Shocks and Broken Balls: When Fortunes Turn 
Foul. 
“Here you are,” said the manager, who had climbed a set of steps 
to take down a thick, black-bound book. “ Unfogging the Future. 
Very good guide to all your basic fortune-telling methods — palm-
istry, crystal balls, bird entrails —” 
But Harry wasn’t listening. His ey es had fallen on another book, 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 54  which was among a display on a small table: Death Omens: What to 
Do When You Know the Worst Is Coming. 
“Oh, I wouldn’t read t h a t i f I w e r e y o u,” said the manager 
lightly, looking to se e what Harry was starin g at. “You’ll start see-
ing death omens everywhere. It’s enough to frighten anyone to 
death.” 
But Harry continued to stare at the front cover of the book; it 
showed a black dog large as a bear , with gleaming eyes. It looked 
oddly familiar. . . . 
The manager pressed Unfogging the Future into Harry’s hands. 
“Anything else?” he said. 
“Yes,” said Harry, tearing his eyes away from the dog’s and 
dazedly consulting his booklist. “Er — I need Intermediate Trans-
figuration and The Standard Book of Spells, Grade Three. ” 
Harry emerged from Flourish and Blotts ten minutes later with 
his new books under his arms and made his way back to the Leaky 
Cauldron, hardly noticing where he was going and bumping into 
several people. 
He tramped up the stai rs to his room, went inside, and tipped 
his books onto his bed. Somebody had been in to tidy; the win-dows were open and sun was pourin g inside. Harry could hear the 
buses rolling by in the unseen Muggle street behind him and the 
sound of the invisible crowd belo w in Diagon Alley. He caught 
sight of himself in the mirror over the basin. 
“It can’t have been a death omen,” h e t o l d h i s r e f l e c t i o n d e f i -
antly. “I was panicking when I saw that thing in Magnolia 
Crescent. . . . It was probably just a stray dog. . . .” 
He raised his hand automatically and tried to make his hair lie flat. 
 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 55  “You’re fighting a losing battle th ere, dear,” said his mirror in a 
wheezy voice. 
 
As the days slipped by, Harry started looking wherever he went for 
a si gn o f R o n o r Hermio ne. Pl e nty o f Ho g warts s tud e nts were ar -
riving in Diagon Alley now, with the start of term so near. Harry met Seamus Finnigan and Dean Th omas, his fellow Gryffindors, in 
Quality Quidditch Supplies, where they too were ogling the Fire-
bolt; he also ran into the real Neville Longbottom, a round-faced, 
forgetful boy, outside Flourish an d Blotts. Harry di dn’t stop to 
chat; Neville appeared to have mislaid his booklist and was being told off by his very formidable -looking grandmother. Harry hoped 
she never found out that he’d pretended to be Neville while on the run from the Ministry of Magic. 
Harry woke on the last day of the holidays, thin king that he 
would at least meet Ron and Hermione tomorrow, on the Hog-warts Express. He got up, dressed, went for a last look at the Fire-
bolt, and was just wondering where he’d have lunch, when 
someone yelled his na me and he turned. 
“Harry! HARRY!” 
They were there, both of them , sitting outside Florean Fortes-
cue’s Ice Cream Parlor — Ron lo oking incredibly freckly Her-
mione very brown, both waving frantically at him. 
“Finally!” said Ron, grinning at Harry as he sat down. “We went 
to the Leaky Cauldron, but they sa id you’d left, and we went to 
Flourish and Blotts, and Madam Malkin’s, and —” 
“I got all my school stuff last week,” Harry explained. “And how 
come you knew I’m staying at the Leaky Cauldron?” 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 56  “Dad,” said Ron simply. 
Mr. Weasley, who worked at the Ministry of Magic, would of 
course have heard the whole story of what ha d happened to Aunt 
Marge. 
“Did you really blow up your aunt, Ha rry?” said Hermione in a 
very serious voice. 
“I didn ’ t mean to,” said Harry while Ron roared with laughter. 
“I just — lost control.” 
“It’s not funny, Ron,” said Hermione sharply. “Honestly, I’m 
amazed Harry wasn’t expelled.” 
“So am I,” admitted Harry. “Forge t expelled, I thought I was go-
ing to be arrested.” He looked at Ron. “Your dad doesn’t know why 
Fudge let me off, does he?” 
“Probably ’cause it’s you, isn’t it ?” shrugged Ron, still chuckling. 
“Famous Harry Potter and all that. I’d hate to see what the Min-
istry’d do to me if I blew up an aunt. Mind you, they’d have to dig 
me up first, because Mum would’ ve killed me. Anyway, you can ask 
Dad yourself this evening. We’r e staying at the Leaky Cauldron 
tonight too! So you can come to King’s Cross with us tomorrow! 
Hermione’s there as well!” 
Hermione nodded, beaming. “Mum and Dad dropped me off 
this morning with all my Hogwarts things.” 
“Excellent!” said Harry happily. “So, have you got all your new 
books and stuff?” 
“Look at this,” said Ron, pullin g a long thin bo x out of a bag 
and opening it. “Brand-new wand . Fourteen inch es, willow, con-
taining one unicorn tail-hair. And we’ve got all our books —” He 
pointed at a large bag under his chair. “What about those Monster 
Books, eh? The assistant nearly cried when we said we wanted two.” 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 57  “What’s all that, Hermione?” Harry asked, pointing at not one 
but three bulging bags in the chair next to her. 
“Well, I’m taking more new subjec ts than you, aren’t I?” said 
Hermione. “Those are my books for Arithmancy, Care of Magical 
Creatures, Divination, the Study of Ancient Runes, Muggle 
Studies —” 
“What are you doing Muggle Studie s for?” said Ron, rolling his 
eyes at Harry. “You’re Muggle-b orn! Your mum and dad are Mug-
gles! You already know all about Muggles!” 
“But it’ll be fascinating to stud y them from the wizarding point 
of view,” said Hermione earnestly. 
“Are you planning to eat or sleep at all this year, Hermione?” 
asked Harry, while Ron snigge red. Hermione ignored them. 
“I’ve still got ten Galleons,” she sa id, checking her purse. “It’s my 
birthday in September, and Mu m and Dad gave me some money 
to get myself an early birthday present.” 
“How about a nice book?” said Ron innocently. 
“No, I don’t think so,” said He rmione composedly. “I really 
want an owl. I mean, Harry’s got Hedwig and you’ve got Errol —” 
“I haven’t,” said Ron. “Errol’s a family owl. All I’ve got is Scab-
bers.” He pulled his pet rat out of his pocket. “And I want to get him checked over,” he added, placin g Scabbers on the table in front 
of them. “I don’t think Egypt agreed with him.” 
Scabbers was looking thinner than usual, and there was a defi-
nite droop to his whiskers. 
“There’s a magical creature shop just over there,” said Harry, 
who knew Diagon Alley very well by now. “You could see if they’ve got anything for Scabbers, and Hermione can get her 
owl.” 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 58  So they paid for their ice cream and crossed the street to the 
Magical Menagerie. 
There wasn’t much room inside. Every inch of wall was hidden 
by cages. It was smelly and very noisy because the occupants of 
these cages were all squeaking, squawking, jabbering, or hissing. 
The witch behind the counter was al ready advising a wizard on the 
care of double-ended newts, so Harry, Ron, and Hermione waited, 
examining the cages. 
A pair of enormous purple toads sat gulping wetly and feasting 
on dead blowflies. A gi gantic tortoise with a jewel-encrusted shell 
was glittering near the window. Po isonous orange snails were ooz-
ing slowly up the side of their glass tank, and a fat white rabbit kept 
changing into a silk top hat and back again with a loud popping 
noise. Then there were cats of ever y color, a noisy cage of ravens, a 
basket of funny custard-colore d furballs that were humming 
loudly, and on the counter, a vast ca ge of sleek black rats that were 
playing some sort of skipping ga me using their long, bald tails. 
The double-ended newt wizard l eft, and Ron approached the 
counter. 
“It’s my rat,” he told the witch. “He been a bit off-color ever 
since I brought him back from Egypt.” 
“Bang him on the counter,” said the witch, pulling a pair of 
heavy black spectacles out of her pocket. 
Ron lifted Scabbers out of his inside pocket and placed him next 
to the cage of his fellow rats, who stopped their skipping tricks and scuffled to the wire for a better look. 
Like nearly everything Ron owned , Scabbers the rat was second-
hand (he had once belonged to Ron’s brother Percy) and a bit 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 59  battered. Next to the glossy rats in the cage, he looked especially 
woebegone. 
“Hm,” said the witch, picking up Scabbers. “How old is this 
rat?” 
“Dunno,” said Ron. “Quite old. He used to belong to my 
brother.” 
“What powers does he have?” sa id the witch, examining Scab-
bers closely. 
“Er —” The truth was that Scabbers had never shown the 
faintest trace of inte resting powers. The witc h’s eyes moved from 
Scabbers’s tattered left ear to his front paw, which had a toe miss-
ing, and tutted loudly. 
“He’s been through the mi ll, this one,” she said. 
“He was like that when Percy gave him to me,” said Ron defen-
sively. 
“An ordinary common or garden rat like this can’t be expected to 
live longer than three years or so ,” said the witch. “Now, if you 
were looking for something a bit more hard-wearing, you might 
like one of these —” 
She indicated the blac k rats, who promptly started skipping 
again. Ron mutter ed, “Show-offs.” 
“Well, if you don’t want a repl acement, you can try this rat 
tonic,” said the witch, reaching under the coun ter and bringing out 
a small red bottle. 
“Okay,” said Ron. “How much — OUCH!” 
Ron buckled as something huge and orange came soaring from 
the top of the highest cage, landed on his head, and then propelled 
itself, spitting ma dly, at Scabbers. 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 60  “NO, CROOKSHANKS, NO!” cried the witch, but Scabbers 
shot from between her hands like a bar of soap, landed splay-legged 
on the floor, and then scampered for the door. 
“Scabbers!” Ron shouted, racing out of the shop after him; 
Harry followed. 
It took them nearly ten minu tes to catch Scabbers, who had 
taken refuge under a wastepaper bin outside Quality Quidditch 
Supplies. Ron stuffed the trembling rat back into his pocket and 
straightened up, massaging his head. 
“What was that?” 
“It was either a very big cat or qu ite a small tiger,” said Harry. 
“Where’s Hermione?” 
“Probably getting her owl —” 
They made their way back up th e crowded street to the Magical 
Menagerie. As they reached it, He rmione came out, but she wasn’t 
carrying an owl. Her arms were clamped tightly around the enor-
mous ginger cat. 
“You bought that monster?” said Ron, his mouth hanging open. 
“He’s gorgeous, isn’t he?” said Hermione, glowing. 
That was a matter of opinion, thought Harr y. The cat’s ginger 
fur was thick and fluffy, but it wa s definitely a bit bowlegged and 
its face looked grumpy and oddly squashed, as thou gh it had run 
headlong into a brick wall. Now that Scabbers was out of sight, however, the cat was purring co ntentedly in He rmione’s arms. 
“Hermione, that thing nearly scalped me!” said Ron. 
“He didn’t mean to, did you, Crookshanks?” said Hermione. 
“And what about Scabbers?” said Ron, pointing at the lump in 
his chest pocket. “He needs rest and relaxation! How’s he going to 
get it with that thing around?” 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 61  “That reminds me, you forgot yo ur rat tonic,” said Hermione, 
slapping the small red bottle into Ron’s hand. “And stop worrying, 
Crookshanks will be sleeping in my dormitory and Scabbers in 
yours, what’ s the problem? Poor Crookshanks, that witch said he’d 
been in there for ages ; no one wanted him.” 
“I wonder why,” said Ron sarcasti cally as they set off toward the 
Leaky Cauldron. 
They found Mr. Weasley sittin g in the bar, reading the Daily 
Prophet. 
“Harry!” he said, smiling as he looked up. “How are you?” 
“Fine, thanks,” said Harry as he, Ron, and Hermione joined Mr. 
Weasley with all their shopping. 
Mr. Weasley put down his paper, and Harry saw the now famil-
iar picture of Sirius Black staring up at him. 
“They still haven’t caught him, then?” he asked. 
“No,” said Mr. Weasley, lookin g extremely grave. “They’ve 
pulled us all off our regular jobs at the Ministry to try and find 
him, but no lu ck so far.” 
“Would we get a reward if we caught him?” asked Ron. “It’ d be 
good to get some more money —” 
“Don’t be ridiculous, Ron,” said Mr. Weasley, who on closer in-
spection looked very strained. “Black ’s not going to be caught by a 
thirteen-year-old wizard. It’s th e Azkaban guards who’ll get him 
back, you mark my words.” 
At that moment Mrs. Weasley en tered the bar, laden with shop-
ping bags and followed by th e twins, Fred and George, who 
were about to start their fifth ye ar at Hogwarts; the newly elected 
Head Boy, Percy; and the Weasleys ’ youngest child and only girl, 
Ginny. 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 62  Ginny, who had always been ve ry taken with Harry, seemed 
even more heartily embarrassed th an usual when she saw him, per-
haps because he had sa ved her life during th eir previous year at 
Hogwarts. She went very red and muttered “hello” without look-
ing at him. Percy, however, held out his hand solemnly as though 
he and Harry had never met and sa id, “Harry. How nice to see 
you.” 
“Hello, Percy,” said Harry, trying not to laugh. 
“I hope you’re well?” said Perc y pompously, shaking hands. It 
was rather like being introduced to the mayor. 
“Very well, thanks —” “Harry!” said Fred, elbowing Pe rcy out of the way and bowing 
deeply. “Simply splendid to see you, old boy —” 
“Marvelous,” said George, pushing Fred aside and seizing 
Harry’s hand in turn. “Absolutely spiffing.” 
Percy scowled. “That’s enough, now,” said Mrs. Weasley. 
“Mum!” said Fred as though he’ d only just spotted her and seiz-
ing her hand too. “How really corking to see you —” 
“I said, that’s enough,” said Mr s. Weasley, depositing her shop-
ping in an empty chair. “Hello, Harry, dear. I suppose you’ve heard 
our exciting news?” She pointed to the brand-new silver badge on 
Percy’s chest. “Second Head Boy in the family!” she said, swelling 
with pride. 
“And last,” Fred muttered under his breath. 
“I don’t doubt that,” said Mrs. Weasley, frowning suddenly. “I 
notice they haven’t ma de you two prefects.” 
“What do we want to be prefects for?” said George, looking re-
volted at the very idea. “It’d take all the fun out of life.” 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 63  Ginny giggled. 
“You want to set a better exampl e for your sister!” snapped Mrs. 
Weasley. 
“Ginny’s got other brothers to se t her an example, Mother,” said 
Percy loftily. “I’m going up to change for dinner. . . .” 
He disappeared and George heaved a sigh. 
“We tried to shut him in a pyra mid,” he told Harry. “But Mum 
spotted us.” 
 
Dinner that night was a very en joyable affair. Tom the innkeeper 
put three tables together in th e parlor, and the seven Weasleys, 
Harry, and Hermione ate their way through five delicious courses. 
“How’re we getting to King’s Cr oss tomorrow, Dad?” asked Fred 
as they dug into a sump tuous chocolate pudding. 
“The Ministry’s providing a couple of cars,” said Mr. Weasley. 
Everyone looked up at him. “Why?” said Percy curiously. 
“It’s because of you, Perce,” said George seriously. “And there’ll 
be little flags on the hoods, with HB on them —” 
“— for Humongous Bighead,” said Fred. 
Everyone except Percy and Mrs. Weasley snorted into their pud-
ding. 
“Why are the Ministry providin g cars, Father?” Percy asked 
again, in a dignified voice. 
“Well, as we haven’t got one anymore,” said Mr. Weasley, 
“— and as I work there, th ey’re doing me a favor —” 
His voice was casual, but Harry couldn’t help noticing that Mr. 
Weasley’s ears had gone red, just like Ron’s did when he was under 
pressure. 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 64  “Good thing, too,” sa id Mrs. Weasley briskly. “Do you realize 
how much luggage you’ve all got between you? A nice sight you’d 
be on the Muggle Underground. . . . You are all packed, aren’t 
you?” 
“Ron hasn’t put all hi s new things in his trunk yet,” said Percy, 
in a long-suffering voice. “H e’s dumped them on my bed.” 
“You’d better go and pack properly, Ron, because we won’t have 
much time in the morning,” Mrs. Weasley called down the table. 
Ron scowled at Percy. 
After dinner everyone felt very full and sleepy. One by one they 
made their way upstairs to their rooms to check their things for the next day. Ron and Percy were nex t door to Harry. He had just 
closed and locked his own trunk when he heard angry voices through the wall, and went to see what was going on. 
The door of number twelve was ajar and Percy was shouting. 
“It was here, on the bedside table, I took it off for polishing —” 
“I haven’t touched it, all right?” Ron roared back. 
“What’s up?” said Harry. 
“My Head Boy badge is gone,” sa id Percy, rounding on Harry. 
“So’s Scabbers’s rat tonic,” said Ron, throwing things out of his 
trunk to look. “I think I might’ve left it in the bar —” 
“You’re not going anywhere till you’ve found my badge!” yelled 
Percy. 
“I’ll get Scabbers’s stuff, I’m pack ed,” Harry said to Ron, and he 
went downstairs. 
Harry was halfway along the passag e to the bar, which was now 
very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from 
the parlor. A second later, he re cognized them as Mr. and Mrs. 
 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 65  Weasleys’. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he’d heard 
them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, 
then move closer to the parlor door. 
“. . . makes no sense not to tell him,” Mr. Weasley was saying 
heatedly. “Harry’s got a right to kn ow. I’ve tried to tell Fudge, but 
he insists on treating Harry like a child. He’s thirteen years old 
and —” 
“Arthur, the truth would terrify him!” said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. 
“Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hang-
ing over him? For heaven’s sake, he’s happy not knowing!” 
“I don ’ t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his 
guard!” retorted Mr. Weasley. “You know what Harry and Ron are 
like, wandering off by themselves — they’ve even ended up in the 
Forbidden Forest! But Harry must n’t do that this year! When I 
think what could have happened to him that night he ran away 
from home! If the Knight Bus hadn ’t picked him up, I’m prepared 
to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.” 
“But he’s not dead, he’s fine, so what’s the point —” 
“Molly, they say Sirius Black’s mad, and maybe he is, but he was 
clever enough to escape from Azka ban, and that’s supposed to be 
impossible. It’s been a month, an d no one’s seen hide nor hair of 
him, and I don’t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, 
we’re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for su re is what Black’s after —” 
“But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.” 
“We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out 
of Azkaban, he can br eak into Hogwarts.” 
“But no one’s really sure that Black’s after Harry —” 
 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 66  There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had 
banged his fist on the table. 
“Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn’t report 
it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went 
out to Azkaban the night Black es caped. The guards told Fudge 
that Black’s been talking in his sl eep for a while now. Always the 
same words: ‘He’s at Hogwarts . . . he’s at Hogwarts.’ Black is de-ranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks 
murdering Harry will brin g You-Know-Who back to power. Black 
lost everything the night Harry stopped You-Know-Who, and he’s 
had twelve years alone in Azka ban to brood on that. . . .” 
There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desper-
ate to hear more. 
“Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you’re 
forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don ’t think anything could hurt 
Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore’s headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?” 
“Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azka-
ban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the 
school grounds. He wasn’t ha ppy about it, but he agreed.” 
“Not happy? Why shouldn’t he be happy, if they’re there to catch 
Black?” 
“Dumbledore isn’t fond of the Azkaban guards,” said Mr. 
Weasley heavily. “Nor am I, if it comes to that . . . but when you’re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces 
with those you’d rather avoid.” 
“If they save Harry —” 
“— then I will never say another word against them,” said Mr. 
Weasley wearily. “It’s late, Molly , we’d better go up. . . .” 
THE LEAKY CAULDRON 
 67  Harry heard chairs move. As quie tly as he could, he hurried 
down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door 
opened, and a few seconds later f ootsteps told him that Mr. and 
Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs. 
The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at 
earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s bed-
room door close, then headed ba ck upstairs with the bottle. 
Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, 
heaving with laughter as they list ened to Percy dismantling his and 
Ron’s room in search of his badge. 
“We’ve got it,” Fred whispered to Harry. “We’ve been improv-
ing it.” 
The badge now read Bighead Boy. 
Harry forced a laugh, went to gi ve Ron the rat tonic, then shut 
himself in his room and lay down on his bed. 
So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge 
had been lenient with him because he was so re lieved to find him 
alive. He’d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where 
there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was 
sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, 
so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the 
train. 
Harry lay listening to the muffle d shouting next door and won-
dered why he didn’t feel more sc ared. Sirius Black had murdered 
thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs. Weasley obviously 
thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But 
Harry happened to agree wholehea rtedly with Mrs. Weasley that 
the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore hap-
pened to be. Didn’t people always say that Dumbledore was the 
CHAPTER FOUR 
 68  only person Lord Vold emort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, 
as Voldemort’s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him? 
And then there were these Azkaba n guards everyone kept talking 
about. They seemed to scare most people senseless, and if they were 
stationed all around the school, Bl ack’s chances of getting inside 
seemed very remote. 
No, all in all, the thing that bo thered Harry most was the fact 
that his chances of visiting Hogs meade now looked like zero. No-
body would want Harry to leave the safety of the castle until Black 
was caught; in fact, Harry suspected his every move would be care-
fully watched until the danger had passed. 
He scowled at the dark ceiling. Did they think he couldn’t look 
after himself? He’d escaped Lord Vo ldemort three times; he wasn’t 
completely useless. . . . 
Unbidden, the image of the beas t in the shadows of Magnolia 
Crescent crossed his mind. W h a t t o d o w h e n y o u k n o w t h e w o r s t i s 
coming. . . . 
“I’m not going to be murdered,” Harry said out loud. 
“That’s the spirit, dear,” said his mirror sleepily.

om woke Harry the next morning with his usual toothless grin and a cup of tea. Harry got dressed and was just per-
suading a disgruntled Hedwig to get back into her cage when Ron 
banged his way into the room, pull ing a sweatshirt over his head 
and looking irritable. 
“The sooner we get on the train, the better,” he said. “At least I 
can get away from Percy at Hogwarts. Now he’s accusing me of 
dripping tea on his photo of P enelope Clearwater. You know,” Ron 
grimaced, “his girlfriend. She’s hidden her face under the frame be-
cause her nose has gone all blotchy. . . .” 
“I’ve got something to tell you, ” Harry began, but they were in-
terrupted by Fred and George, who had looked in to congratulate 
Ron on infuriating Percy again. 
They headed down to breakfast, where Mr. Weasley was reading 
the front page of the Daily Prophet with a furrowed brow and Mrs. 
 T 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 70  Weasley was telling Hermione and Ginny about a love potion she’d 
made as a young girl. All three of them were rather giggly. 
“What were you saying?” Ron as ked Harry as they sat down. 
“Later,” Harry muttered as Percy stormed in. 
Harry had no chance to speak to Ron or Hermione in the chaos 
of leaving; they were too busy heaving all their trunks down the 
Leaky Cauldron’s narrow staircase and piling them up near the door, with Hedwig and Hermes, Pe rcy’s screech owl, perched on 
top in their cages. A small wicker work basket stood beside the heap 
of trunks, spitting loudly. 
“It’s all right, Crookshanks,” He rmione cooed through the wicker-
work. “I’ll let you out on the train.” 
“You won’t,” snapped Ron. “Wha t about poor Scabbers, eh?” 
He pointed at his chest, where a large lump indicated that Scab-
bers was curled up in his pocket. 
Mr. Weasley, who had been ou tside waiting for the Ministry 
cars, stuck his head inside. 
“They’re here,” he said. “Harry, come on.” 
Mr. Weasley marched Harry acro ss the short stretch of pave-
ment toward the first of two old-fashioned dark green cars, each of 
which was driven by a furtive-looking wizard wearing a suit of 
emerald velvet. 
“In you get, Harry,” said Mr. Weasley, glancing up and down the 
crowded street. 
Harry got into the back of the car and was shortly joined by 
Hermione, Ron, and, to Ron’s disgust, Percy. 
The journey to King’s Cross was very uneventful compared with 
Harry’s trip on the Knig ht Bus. The Ministry of Magic cars seemed 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 71  almost ordinary, though Harry noticed that they could slide 
through gaps that Uncle Vernon’s new company car certainly 
couldn’t have managed. They re ached King’s Cross with twenty 
minutes to spare; the Ministry drivers found them trolleys, un-
loaded their trunks, touched their hats in salute to Mr. Weasley, and drove away, somehow managing to jump to the head of an un-moving line at th e traffic lights. 
Mr. Weasley kept close to Harry’s elbow all the way into the 
station. 
“Right then,” he said, glancing around them. “Let’s do this in 
pairs, as there are so many of us. I’ll go through first with Harry.” 
Mr. Weasley strolled toward the barrier between platforms nine 
and ten, pushing Harry’s trolley an d apparently very interested in 
the InterCity 125 that had just a rrived at platform nine. With a 
meaningful look at Harry, he leaned casually against the barrier. Harry imitated him. 
In a moment, they had fallen si deways through the solid metal 
onto platform nine and three-quar ters and looked up to see the 
Hogwarts Express, a scarlet stea m engine, puffing smoke over a 
platform packed with witches an d wizards seeing their children 
onto the train. 
Percy and Ginny suddenly appeared behind Harry. They were 
panting and had apparently taken the barrier at a run. 
“Ah, there’s Penelope!” said Perc y, smoothing his hair and going 
pink again. Ginny caught Harry’s eye, and they both turned away 
to hide their laughter as Percy strode over to a girl with long, curly 
hair, walking with his chest thrown out so that she couldn’t miss his 
shiny badge. 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 72  Once the remaining Weasleys and Hermione had joined them, 
Harry and Ron led the way to the end of the train, past packed 
compartments, to a carriage that l ooked quite empty. They loaded 
the trunks onto it, stowed Hedwig and Crookshanks in the luggage 
rack, then went back outside to say good-bye to Mr. and Mrs. 
Weasley. 
Mrs. Weasley kissed all her children, then Hermione, and finally, 
Harry. He was embarrassed, but real ly quite pleased, when she gave 
him an extra hug. 
“Do take care, won’t you, Harry?” she said as she straightened up, 
her eyes oddly bright. Then she opened her enormous handbag and 
said, “I’ve made you all sandwiches. . . . Here you are, Ron . . . no, 
they’re not corned beef. . . . Fr ed? Where’s Fred? Here you are, 
dear. . . .” 
“Harry,” said Mr. Weasley quietly, “come over here a mo-
ment.” 
He jerked his head toward a pillar, and Harry followed him be-
hind it, leaving the others crowded around Mrs. Weasley. 
“There’s something I’ve got to te ll you before you leave —” said 
Mr. Weasley, in a tense voice. 
“It’s all right, Mr. Weasley,” said Harry. “I already know.” “You know? How could you know?” 
“I — er — I heard you and Mrs. Weasley talking last night. I 
couldn’t help hearing,” Harry added quickly. “Sorry —” 
“That’s not the way I’d have chosen for you to find out,” said 
Mr. Weasley, looking anxious. 
“No — honestly, it’s okay. This way, you haven’t broken your 
word to Fudge and I kn ow what’s going on.” 
“Harry, you must be very scared —” 
THE DEMENTOR 
 73  “I’m not,” said Harry sincerely. “ Really,” he added, because Mr. 
Weasley was looking disbelieving. “I ’m not trying to be a hero, but 
seriously, Sirius Black can’t be worse than Voldemort, can he?” 
Mr. Weasley flinched at the sound of the name but over-
looked it. 
“Harry, I knew you we re, well, made of stronger stuff than 
Fudge seems to think, and I’m ob viously pleased that you’re not 
scared, but —” 
“Arthur!” called Mrs. Weasley, who was now shepherding the 
rest onto the train. “Arthur, what are you doing? It’s about to go!” 
“He’s coming, Molly!” said Mr. We asley but he turned back to 
Harry and kept talking in a lower and more hurried voice. “Listen, 
I want you to give me your word —” 
“— that I’ll be a good boy and st ay in the castle?” said Harry 
gloomily. 
“Not entirely,” said Mr. Weasley, who looked more serious than 
Harry had ever seen him. “Harry, swear to me you won’t go looking 
for Black.” 
Harry stared. “What?” 
There was a loud whistle. Guards were walking along the train, 
slamming all the doors shut. 
“Promise me, Harry,” said Mr. We asley, talking more quickly 
still, “that whatever happens —” 
“Why would I go looking for some one I know wants to kill me?” 
said Harry blankly. 
“Swear to me that whatever you might hear —” 
“Arthur, quickly!” cried Mrs. Weasley. Steam was billowing from the tr ain; it had started to move. 
Harry ran to the compartment d oor and Ron threw it open and 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 74  stood back to let him on. They leaned out of the window and 
waved at Mr. and Mrs. Weasley unti l the train turned a corner and 
blocked them from view. 
“I need to talk to you in pr ivate,” Harry muttered to Ron and 
Hermione as the trai n picked up speed. 
“Go away, Ginny,” said Ron. 
“Oh, that’s nice,” said Ginny huffily, and she stalked off. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione set off down the co rridor, looking 
for an empty compartmen t, but all were full except for the one at 
the very end of the train. 
This had only one occu pant, a man sitting fast asleep next to the 
window. Harry, Ron, and Hermio ne checked on the threshold. 
The Hogwarts Express was usually reserved for students and they 
had never seen an adult there b efore, except for the witch who 
pushed the food cart. 
The stranger was wearing an extr emely shabby set of wizard’s 
robes that had been darned in seve ral places. He looked ill and ex-
hausted. Though quite young, hi s light brown hair was flecked 
with gray. 
“Who d’you reckon he is?” Ron hissed as they sat down and slid 
the door shut, taking the seats farthest aw ay from the window. 
“Professor R. J. Lupin,” wh ispered Hermione at once. 
“How d’you know that?” “It’s on his case,” she replied, pointing at the luggage rack 
over the man’s head, where there was a small, battered case held to-
gether with a large quantity of neatly knotted string. The name Professor R. J. Lupin was stamped across one corner in peeling 
letters. 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 75  “Wonder what he teaches?” said Ron, frowning at Professor 
Lupin’s pallid profile. 
“That’s obvious,” whispered Hermione. “There’s only one va-
cancy, isn’t there? Defense Against the Dark Arts.” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione had already had two Defense 
Against the Dark Arts teachers, both of whom had lasted only one 
year. There were rumors that the job was jinxed. 
“Well, I hope he’s up to it,” said Ron doubtfully. “He looks like 
one good hex would finish him off, doesn’t he? Anyway . . .” He 
turned to Harry. “What were you going to tell us?” 
Harry explained all about Mr. and Mrs. Weasley’s argument and 
the warning Mr. Weasley had just given him. When he’d finished, 
Ron looked thunderstruck, and Hermione had her hands over her 
mouth. She finally lowered them to say, “Sirius Black escaped to 
come after you? Oh, Harry . . . you’ll have to be really, really care-
ful. Don’t go looking for trouble, Harry —” 
“I don’t go looking for trouble, ” said Harry, nettled. “Trouble 
usually finds me.” 
“How thick would Harry have to be, to go looking for a nutter 
who wants to kill him?” said Ron shakily. 
They were taking the news worse than Harry had expected. 
Both Ron and Hermione seemed to be much more frightened of 
Black than he was. 
“No one knows how he got out of Azkaban,” said Ron uncom-
fortably. “No one’s ever done it before. And he was a top-security prisoner too.” 
“But they’ll catch him, won’t th ey?” said Hermione earnestly. “I 
mean, they’ve got all the Muggles looking out for him too. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 76  “What’s that noise?” said Ron suddenly. 
A faint, tinny sort of whistle wa s coming from somewhere. They 
looked all around the compartment. 
“It’s coming from your trunk, Ha rry,” said Ron, standing up and 
reaching into the luggage rack. A moment later he had pulled the 
Pocket Sneakoscope out from between Harry’s robes. It was spin-ning very fast in the palm of Ro n’s hand and glowing brilliantly. 
“Is that a Sneakoscope ?” said Hermione interestedly, standing up 
for a better look. 
“Yeah . . . mind you, it’s a ve ry cheap one,” Ron said. “It went 
haywire just as I was tying it to Errol’s leg to send it to Harry.” 
“Were you doing anything untrustworthy at the time?” said 
Hermione shrewdly. 
“No! Well . . . I wasn’t supposed to be using Errol. You know 
he’s not really up to long journeys . . . but how else was I supposed to get Harry’s present to him?” 
“Stick it back in the trunk,” Harry advised as the Sneakoscope 
whistled piercingly, “or it’ll wake him up.” 
He nodded toward Professor Lu pin. Ron stuffed the Sneako-
scope into a particularly horrible pair of Uncle Vern on’s old socks, 
which deadened the sound, then closed the lid of the trunk on it. 
“We could get it checked in Hogs meade,” said Ron, sitting back 
down. “They sell that sort of t hing in Dervish and Banges, magical 
instruments and stuff. Fred and George told me.” 
“Do you know much about Hogsmeade?” asked Hermione 
keenly. “I’ve read it’s the only entirely non-Muggle settlement in 
Britain —” 
“Yeah, I think it is,” said Ron in an offhand sort of way, 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 77  “but that’s not why I want to go. I just want to get inside Honey-
dukes!” 
“What’s that?” said Hermione. 
“It’s this sweetshop,” said Ron, a dreamy look coming over his 
face, “where they’ve got everything. . . . Pepper Imps — they make 
you smoke at the mouth — and grea t fat Chocoballs full of straw-
berry mousse and clotted cream, an d really excellent sugar quills, 
which you can suck in class and just look like you’re thinking what to write next —” 
“But Hogsmeade’s a very interesting place, isn’t it?” Hermione 
pressed on eagerly. “In Sites of Historical Sorcery it says the inn was 
the headquarters for the 1612 goblin rebellion, an d the Shrieking 
Shack’s supposed to be the most severely haunted building in Britain —” 
“— and massive sherbet balls that make you levitate a few 
inches off the ground while you’re sucking them,” said Ron, who 
was plainly not listening to a word Hermione was saying. 
Hermione looked around at Harry. 
“Won’t it be nice to get out of school for a bit and explore 
Hogsmeade?” 
“ ’Spect it will,” said Harry heavily. “You’ll have to tell me when 
you’ve found out.” 
“What d’you mean?” said Ron. “I can’t go. The Dursleys didn’t s i g n m y p e r m i s s i o n f o r m , a n d 
Fudge wouldn’t either.” 
Ron looked horrified. “You’re not allowed to come ? But — no way — McGonagall or 
someone will give you permission —” 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 78  Harry gave a hollow laugh. Pro fessor McGonagall, head of 
Gryffindor House, was very strict. 
“— or we can ask Fred and Geor ge, they know every secret pas-
sage out of the castle —” 
“Ron!” said Hermione sharply. “I don’t think Harry should be 
sneaking out of school wi th Black on the loose —” 
“Yeah, I expect that’s what McGonagall will say when I ask for 
permission,” said Harry bitterly. 
“But if we’re with him,” said Ron spiritedly to Hermione, “Black 
wouldn’t dare —” 
“Oh, Ron, don’t talk rubbish,” snapped Hermione. “Black’s al-
ready murdered a whole bunch of people in the middle of a 
crowded street. Do you really thin k he’s going to worry about at-
tacking Harry just because we’re there?” 
She was fumbling with the straps of Crookshanks’s basket as she 
spoke. 
“Don’t let that thing out!” Ron said, but too late; Crookshanks 
leapt lightly from the basket, stre tched, yawned, and sprang onto 
Ron’s knees; the lump in Ron’s po cket trembled and he shoved 
Crookshanks angrily away. 
“Get out of here!” 
“Ron, don’t!” said Hermione angrily. 
Ron was about to answer back when Professor Lupin stirred. 
They watched him apprehensively, but he simply turned his head the other way, mouth slightly open, and slept on. 
The Hogwarts Express moved steadily north and the scenery 
outside the window became wilder and darker while the clouds 
overhead thickened. People were chasing backward and forward 
past the door of thei r compartment. Crooks hanks had now settled 
THE DEMENTOR 
 79  in an empty seat, his squashed face turned toward Ron, his yellow 
eyes on Ron’s top pocket. 
At one o’clock, the plump witch wi th the food cart arrived at the 
compartment door. 
“D’you think we should wake him up?” Ron asked awkwardly, 
nodding toward Professor Lupin. “He looks like he could do with 
some food.” 
Hermione approached Professor Lupin cautiously. 
“Er — Professor?” she said. “Excuse me — Professor?” 
He didn’t move. “Don’t worry, dear,” said the wi tch as she handed Harry a large 
stack of Cauldron Cakes. “If he’ s hungry when he wakes, I’ll be up 
front with the driver.” 
“I suppose he is asleep?” said Ron quietly as the witch slid the 
compartment door closed. “I mean — he hasn’t died, has he?” 
“No, no, he’s breathing,” whispe red Hermione, taking the Caul-
dron Cake Harr y passed her. 
He might not be very good compan y, but Professor Lupin’s pres-
ence in their compartment had its uses. Midafternoon , just as it 
had started to rain, blurring the rolling hills outside the window, 
they heard footsteps in the corridor again, an d their three least fa-
vorite people appeared at the door: Draco Ma lfoy, flanked by his 
cronies, Vincent Crabbe and Gregory Goyle. 
Draco Malfoy and Harry had been enemies ever since they 
had met on their very first trai n journey to Hogwarts. Malfoy, 
who had a pale, pointed, sneering face, was in Slytherin House; he 
played Seeker on the Slytherin Qu idditch team, the same position 
that Harry played on the Gryf findor team. Crabbe and Goyle 
seemed to exist to do Malfoy’s bidding. They were both wide and 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 80  musclely; Crabbe was taller, with a pudding-bowl haircut and a 
very thick neck; Goyle ha d short, bristly hair and long, gorilla-ish 
arms. 
“Well, look who it is,” said Malfoy in his usual lazy drawl, 
pulling open the compartment do or. “Potty and the Weasel.” 
Crabbe and Goyle ch uckled trollishly. 
“I heard your father finally got his hands on some gold this sum-
mer, Weasley,” said Malfoy. “Did your mother die of shock?” 
Ron stood up so quic kly he knocked Crooks hanks’s basket to 
the floor. Professor Lu pin gave a snort. 
“Who’s that?” said Ma lfoy, taking an automatic step backward as 
he spotted Lupin. 
“New teacher,” said Harry, who got to his feet, too, in case he 
needed to hold Ron back. “Wha t were you saying, Malfoy?” 
Malfoy’s pale eyes narrowed; he wasn’t fool enough to pick a 
fight right under a teacher’s nose. 
“C’mon,” he muttered resentfu lly to Crabbe and Goyle, and 
they disappeared. 
Harry and Ron sat down again, Ron massaging his knuckles. 
“I’m not going to take any crap from Malfoy this year,” he said 
angrily. “I mean it. If he make s one more crack about my family, 
I’m going to get hold of his head and —” 
Ron made a violent gesture in midair. 
“Ron,” hissed Hermione, pointi ng at Professor Lupin, “be care-
ful . . .” 
But Professor Lupin was still fast asleep. The rain thickened as the train sped yet farther north; the 
windows were now a solid, shi mmering gray, which gradually 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 81  darkened until lanterns flickered into life all along the corridors 
and over the luggage racks. The train rattled, the rain hammered, 
the wind roared, but still, Professor Lupin slept. 
“We must be nearly there,” said Ron, leaning forward to look 
past Professor Lupin at the now completely black window. 
The words had hardly left him when the train started to slow 
down. 
“Great,” said Ron, getting up an d walking carefully past Profes-
sor Lupin to try and see outside. “I’m starving. I want to get to the 
feast. . . .” 
“We can’t be there yet,” said Hermione, checking her watch. “So why’re we stopping?” 
The train was getting slower and slower. As the noise of the pis-
tons fell away, the wind and rain sounded louder than ever against 
the windows. 
Harry, who was nearest the door, got up to look into the corri-
dor. All along the carriage, heads were sticking curiously out of 
their compartments. 
The train came to a stop with a jolt, and distant thuds and bangs 
told them that luggage had fallen out of the racks. Then, without 
warning, all the lamps went out an d they were plunged into total 
darkness. 
“What’s going on?” said Ron’ s voice from behind Harry. 
“Ouch!” gasped Hermione. “R on, that was my foot!” 
Harry felt his way ba ck to his seat. 
“D’you think we’v e broken down?” 
“Dunno . . .” 
There was a squeaking sound, and Harry saw the dim black 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 82  outline of Ron, wiping a patch clean on the window and peer-
ing out. 
“There’s something moving ou t there,” Ron said. “I think 
people are coming aboard. . . .” 
The compartment door suddenly opened and someone fell 
painfully over Harry’s legs. 
“Sorry — d’you know what’s going on? — Ouch — sorry —” 
“Hullo, Neville,” said Harry, fe eling around in the dark and 
pulling Neville up by his cloak. 
“Harry? Is that you? What’s happening?” 
“No idea — sit down —” There was a loud hissing and a yelp of pain; Neville had tried to 
sit on Crookshanks. 
“I’m going to go and ask the driver what’s going on,” came 
Hermione’s voice. Harry felt her pass him, heard the door slide 
open again, and then a thud and two loud squeals of pain. 
“Who’s that?” 
“Who’s that?” 
“Ginny?” 
“Hermione?” 
“What are you doing?” 
“I was looking for Ron —” 
“Come in and sit down —” 
“Not here!” said Harry hurriedly. “ I’m here!” 
“Ouch!” said Neville. 
“Quiet!” said a hoarse voice suddenly. 
Professor Lupin appeared to have woken up at last. Harry could 
hear movements in his corn er. None of them spoke. 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 83  There was a soft, crackling noise, and a shivering light filled the 
compartment. Professor Lupin appear ed to be holding a handful of 
flames. They illuminated his tired, gray face, but his eyes looked 
alert and wary. 
“Stay where you are,” he said in the same hoarse voice, and he 
got slowly to his feet with his hand ful of fire held out in front of 
him. 
But the door slid slowly open before Lupin could reach it. 
Standing in the doorway, illuminated by the shivering flames in 
Lupin’s hand, was a cloaked figure that towered to the ceiling. Its 
face was completely hidden beneat h its hood. Harry’s eyes darted 
downward, and what he saw made his stomach contract. There was 
a hand protruding from the cloak and it was glistening, grayish, 
slimy-looking, and scabbed, like something dead that had decayed 
in water. . . . 
But it was visible only for a spli t second. As though the creature 
beneath the cloak sensed Harry’s ga ze, the hand was suddenly with-
drawn into the folds of its black cloak. 
And then the thing beneath the h ood, whatever it was, drew a 
long, slow, rattling breath, as thou gh it were trying to suck some-
thing more than air from its surroundings. 
An intense cold swept over them all. Harry felt his own breath 
catch in his chest. The cold went d eeper than his skin. It was inside 
his chest, it was inside his very heart. . . . 
Harry’s eyes rolled up into his h e a d . H e c o u l d n ’ t s e e . H e w a s 
drowning in cold. There was a rush ing in his ears as though of 
water. He was being dragged downward, the roaring growing 
louder . . . 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 84  And then, from far away, he heard screaming, terrible, terrified, 
pleading screams. He wanted to he lp whoever it was, he tried to 
move his arms, but couldn’t . . . a thick white fog was swirling 
around him, inside him — 
“Harry! Harry! Are you all right?” Someone was slapping his face. “W — what?” 
Harry opened his eyes; there were lanterns above him, and the 
floor was shaking — the Hogwarts Express was moving again and the lights had come back on. He seem ed to have slid out of his seat 
onto the floor. Ron and Hermione were kneeling next to him, and 
above them he could see Nevill e and Professor Lupin watching. 
Harry felt very sick; when he put up h i s h a n d t o p u s h h i s g l a s s e s 
back on, he felt cold sweat on his face. 
Ron and Hermione heaved him back onto his seat. 
“Are you okay?” Ron asked nervously. “Yeah,” said Harry, looking quickly toward the door. The 
hooded creature had va nished. “What happene d? Where’s that — 
that thing? Who screamed?” 
“No one screamed,” said Ron, more nervously still. 
Harry looked around the brig ht compartment. Ginny and 
Neville looked back at him, both very pale. 
“But I heard screaming —” 
A loud snap made them all jump . Professor Lupin was breaking 
an enormous slab of chocolate into pieces. 
“Here,” he said to Harry, handing him a particularly large piece. 
“Eat it. It ’ll help.” 
Harry took the chocolate but didn’t eat it. 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 85  “What was that thing? ” he asked Lupin. 
“A dementor,” said Lupin, wh o was now giving chocolate to 
everyone else. “One of th e dementors of Azkaban.” 
Everyone stared at him. Profe ssor Lupin crumpled up the empty 
chocolate wrapper and pu t it in his pocket. 
“Eat,” he repeated. “It’ ll help. I need to speak to the driver, ex-
cuse me . . .” 
He strolled past Harry and di sappeared into the corridor. 
“Are you sure you’re okay, Ha rry?” said Hermione, watching 
Harry anxiously. 
“I don’t get it. . . . What happ ened?” said Harry, wiping more 
sweat off his face. 
“Well — that thing — the dementor — stood there and looked 
around (I mean, I think it did, I couldn’t see its face) — and 
you — you —” 
“I thought you were having a fi t or something,” said Ron, who 
still looked scared. “You went sort of rigid and fell out of your seat 
and started twitching —” 
“And Professor Lupin stepped over you, and walked toward the 
dementor, and pulled out his wand,” said Hermione, “and he said, 
‘None of us is hiding Sirius Black under our cloaks. Go.’ But the 
dementor didn’t move, so Lupin muttered something, and a silvery 
thing shot out of his wand at it, and it turned around and sort of 
glided away. . . .” 
“It was horrible,” said Neville, in a higher voice than usual. “Did 
you feel how cold it go t when it came in?” 
“I felt weird,” said Ron, shifting his shoulders uncomfortably. 
“Like I’d never be ch eerful again. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 86  Ginny, who was huddled in her cor ner looking nearly as bad as 
Harry felt, gave a smal l sob; Hermione went over and put a com-
forting arm around her. 
“But didn’t any of you — fall off your seats?” said Harry awk-
wardly. 
“No,” said Ron, looking anxiou sly at Harry again. “Ginny was 
shaking like mad, though. . . .” 
Harry didn’t understand. He felt we ak and shivery, as though he 
were recovering from a bad bout of flu; he also felt the beginnings 
of shame. Why had he gone to piec es like that, when no one else 
had? 
Professor Lupin had come back. He paused as he entered, 
looked around, and said, with a sm all smile, “I haven’t poisoned 
that chocolate, you know. . . .” 
Harry took a bite and to his grea t surprise felt warmth spread 
suddenly to the tips of his fingers and toes. 
“We’ll be at Hogwarts in ten minutes,” said Professor Lupin. 
“Are you all right, Harry?” 
Harry didn’t ask how Professor Lupin knew his name. 
“Fine,” he muttered, embarrassed. 
They didn’t talk much during the remainder of the journey. At 
long last, the train stopped at Ho gsmeade station, and there was a 
great scramble to get outside; owls hooted, cats meowed, and 
Neville’s pet toad croaked loudly from under his hat. It was freez-ing on the tiny platform; rain was driving down in icy sheets. 
“Firs’ years this way!” called a familiar voice. Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione turned and saw the giga ntic outline of Hagrid at the 
other end of the platform, beckon ing the terrified-looking new stu-
dents forward for their tradit ional journey across the lake. 
THE DEMENTOR 
 87  “All righ’, you three?” Hagrid ye lled over the heads of the crowd. 
They waved at him, but had no ch ance to speak to him because the 
mass of people around them was shunting them away along 
the platform. Harry, Ron, and Herm ione followed the rest of the 
school along the platform and ou t onto a rough mud track, where 
at least a hundred st agecoaches awaited the remaining students, 
each pulled, Harry could only assu me, by an invisible horse, be-
cause when they climbed inside an d shut the door, the coach set off 
all by itself, bumping an d swaying in procession. 
The coach smelled faintly of mold and straw. Harry felt better 
since the chocolate, but still we ak. Ron and Hermione kept look-
ing at him sideways, as though fr ightened he might collapse again. 
As the carriage trundled toward a pair of magnificent wrought 
iron gates, flanked with stone co lumns topped with winged boars, 
Harry saw two more towering, hoode d dementors, standing guard 
on either side. A wave of cold sickness threatened to engulf him again; he leaned back into the lu mpy seat and closed his eyes until 
they had passed the gates. The ca rriage picked up speed on the 
long, sloping drive up to the castle; Hermione was leaning out of 
the tiny window, watc hing the many turrets and towers draw 
nearer. At last, the carriage sway ed to a halt, and Hermione and 
Ron got out. 
As Harry stepped down, a drawling, delighted voice sounded in 
his ear. 
“You fainted, Potter? Is Longbottom tell ing the truth? You actu-
ally fainted ?” 
Malfoy elbowed past Hermione to block Harry’s way up the 
stone steps to the castle, his face gleeful and his pale eyes glinting 
maliciously. 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 88  “Shove off, Malfoy,” said Ron, whose jaw was clenched. 
“Did you faint as well, Weasley?” said Malfoy loudly. “Did the 
scary old dementor fright en you too, Weasley?” 
“Is there a problem?” said a mild voice. Professor Lupin had just 
gotten out of the next carriage. 
Malfoy gave Professor Lupin an in solent stare, which took in the 
patches on his robes and the delapidated suitcase. With a tiny hint 
of sarcasm in his voice, he said, “Oh, no — er — Professor, ” then 
he smirked at Crabbe and Goyle an d led them up the steps into the 
castle. 
Hermione prodded Ron in the back to make him hurry, and the 
three of them joined the crowd sw arming up the steps, through the 
giant oak front doors, in to the cavernous entrance hall, which was 
lit with flaming torches, and housed a magnificent marble staircase that led to the upper floors. 
The door into the Great Hall stood open at the right; Harry fol-
lowed the crowd toward it, but ha d barely glimpsed the enchanted 
ceiling, which was black and clou dy tonight, when a voice called, 
“Potter! Granger! I want to see you both!” 
Harry and Hermione turned ar ound, surprised. Professor 
McGonagall, Transfiguration teac her and head of Gryffindor 
House, was calling over the heads of the crowd. She was a stern-looking witch who wore her hair in a tight bun; her sharp eyes were 
framed with square spectacles. Harry fought his way over to her with a feeling of foreboding: Professor McGonagall had a way of 
making him feel he must ha ve done something wrong. 
“There’s no need to look so worried — I just want a word in my 
office,” she told them. “Move along there, Weasley.” 
Ron stared as Professor McGonagall ushe red Harry and 
THE DEMENTOR 
 89  Hermione away from the chatte ring crowd; they accompanied 
her across the entrance hall, up th e marble staircase, and along a 
corridor. 
Once they were in her office, a small room with a large, wel-
coming fire, Professor McGonagall motioned Harry and Her-
mione to sit down. She settled herself behind her desk and said abruptly, “Professor Lupin sent an owl ahead to say that you were 
taken ill on the train, Potter.” 
Before Harry could reply, there was a soft knock on the door and 
Madam Pomfrey, the nurse, came bustling in. 
Harry felt himself going red in th e face. It was bad enough that 
he’d passed out, or whatever he had done, withou t everyone mak-
ing all this fuss. 
“I’m fine,” he said, “I don’t need anything —” “Oh, it’s you, is it?” said Ma dam Pomfrey, ignoring this and 
bending down to stare closely at hi m. “I suppose you’ve been doing 
something dangerous again?” 
“It was a dementor, Poppy,” said Professor McGonagall. 
They exchanged a dark look, and Madam Pomfrey clucked dis-
approvingly. 
“Setting dementors ar ound a school,” sh e muttered, pushing 
back Harry’s hair and feeling his forehead. “He won’t be the last one who collapses. Yes, he’s all clammy. Terrib le things, they are, 
and the effect they have on people who are already delicate —” 
“I’m not delicate!” said Harry crossly. 
“Of course you’re not,” said Madam Pomfrey absentmindedly, 
now taking his pulse. 
“What does he need?” said Profes sor McGonagall crisply. “Bed 
rest? Should he perhaps spend to night in the hospital wing?” 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 90  “I’m fine!” said Harry, jumping up. The thought of what Draco 
Malfoy would say if he had to go to the hospital wing was torture. 
“ W e l l , h e s h o u l d h a v e s o m e c h o c olate, at the very least,” said 
Madam Pomfrey, who wa s now trying to peer into Harry’s eyes. 
“I’ve already had some,” said Ha rry. “Professor Lupin gave me 
some. He gave it to all of us.” 
“Did he, now?” said Madam Pomf rey approvingly. “So we’ve fi-
nally got a Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who knows his 
remedies?” 
“Are you sure you feel all right, Potter?” Professor McGonagall 
said sharply. 
“Yes,” said Harry. 
“Very well. Kindly wait outside while I have a quick word with 
Miss Granger about her course schedule, then we can go down to 
the feast together.” 
Harry went back into the corridor with Madam Pomfrey, who 
left for the hospital wi ng, muttering to herself. He had to wait only 
a few minutes; then Hermione emerged looking very happy about 
something, followed by Professo r McGonagall, and the three of 
them made their way back down th e marble staircase to the Great 
Hall. 
It was a sea of pointed black hats ; each of the long House tables 
was lined with students, their fa ces glimmering by the light of 
thousands of candles, which were floating over the tables in mid-
air. Professor Flitwick, who was a ti ny little wizard with a shock of 
white hair, was carrying an ancient hat and a three-legged stool out 
of the hall. 
“Oh,” said Hermione softly, “we’ve missed the Sorting!” 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 91  New students at Hogwarts were so rted into Houses by trying on 
the Sorting Hat, which shouted out the House they were best 
suited to (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, or Slytherin). Profes-
sor McGonagall strode off toward he r empty seat at the staff table, 
and Harry and Hermione set off in the other direction, as quietly 
as possible, toward the Gryffindor table. People looked around at 
them as they passed along the back of the hall, and a few of them 
pointed at Harry. Had the story of his collapsing in front of the de-mentor traveled that fast? 
He and Hermione sat down on ei ther side of Ron, who had 
saved them seats. 
“What was all that about? ” he muttered to Harry. 
Harry started to explain in a whis per, but at that moment the 
headmaster stood up to speak, and he broke off. 
Professor Dumbledore, though very old, always gave an impres-
sion of great energy. He had several feet of long silver hair and beard, half-moon spec tacles, and an extremely crooked nose. He 
was often described as the greatest wi zard of the age, but that wasn’t 
why Harry respected him. You coul dn’t help trusting Albus Dum-
bledore, and as Harry watched him beaming around at the stu-
dents, he felt really calm for the first time since the dementor had 
entered the train compartment. 
“Welcome!” said Dumbledore, th e candlelight s himmering on 
his beard. “Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! I have a few 
things to say to you all, and as on e of them is very serious, I think 
it best to get it out of the way before you become befuddled by our 
excellent feast. . . .” 
Dumbledore cleared his throat an d continued, “As you will all 
 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 92  be aware after their search of the Hogwarts Express, our school is 
presently playing host to some of the dementors of Azkaban, who 
are here on Ministry of Magic business.” 
He paused, and Harry remembered what Mr. Weasley had said 
about Dumbledore not being happy with the dementors guarding 
the school. 
“They are stationed at every entr ance to the grounds,” Dumble-
dore continued, “and while they are with us, I must make it plain 
that nobody is to leave school without permission. Dementors are 
not to be fooled by tricks or disguises — or even Invisibility 
Cloaks,” he added blandly, an d Harry and Ron glanced at each 
other. “It is not in the nature of a dementor to understand pleading 
or excuses. I therefore warn each and every one of you to give them 
n o r e a s o n t o h a r m y o u . I l o o k to the prefects, and our new Head 
Boy and Girl, to make sure that no student runs afoul of the de-
mentors,” he said. 
Percy, who was sitting a few seats down from Harry, puffed out 
his chest again and stared around impressively. Dumbledore 
paused again; he looked very seriously around the hall, and nobody 
moved or made a sound. 
“On a happier note,” he continue d, “I am pleased to welcome 
two new teachers to our ranks this year. 
“First, Professor Lupin, who has kindly consented to fill the post 
of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” 
There was some scattered, rather unenthusiastic applause. Only 
those who had been in the compartment on th e train with Profes-
sor Lupin clapped hard, Harry among them. Professor Lupin 
looked particularly shabby next to all the other te achers in their 
best robes. 
THE DEMENTOR 
 93  “Look at Snape!” Ron hissed in Harry’s ear. 
Professor Snape, the Potions mast er, was staring along the staff 
table at Professor Lupin. It was common knowledge that Snape 
wanted the Defense Against the Da rk Arts job, but even Harry, 
who hated Snape, was startled at the expression twisting his thin, 
sallow face. It was beyond anger: it was loathing. Harry knew that 
expression only too well; it was th e look Snape wore every time he 
set eyes on Harry. 
“As to our second new appointment,” Dumbledore continued as 
the lukewarm applause for Professor Lupin died away. “Well, I am sorry to tell you that Professor Kettleburn, our Care of Magical 
Creatures teacher, retired at the end of last year in order to enjoy 
more time with his remaining limb s. However, I am delighted to 
say that his place will be filled by none other than Rubeus Hagrid, 
who has agreed to take on this teaching job in addition to his 
gamekeeping duties.” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione star ed at one another, stunned. 
Then they joined in with the ap plause, which was tumultuous at 
the Gryffindor table in particul ar. Harry leaned forward to see 
Hagrid, who was ruby-red in the fa ce and staring down at his enor-
mous hands, his wide grin hidden in the tangle of his black beard. 
“We should’ve known!” Ron roared , pounding the table. “Who 
else would have assigned us a biting book?” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione were the last to stop clapping, and 
as Professor Dumbledore started speaking again, they saw that 
Hagrid was wiping his ey es on the tablecloth. 
“Well, I think that’s everything of importance,” said Dumble-
dore. “Let the feast begin!” 
The golden plates and goblets before them filled suddenly with 
CHAPTER FIVE 
 94  food and drink. Harry, suddenly ravenous, helped himself to 
everything he could re ach and began to eat. 
It was a delicious feast; the hall echoed with talk , laughter, and 
the clatter of knives and forks. Harry, Ro n, and Hermione, how-
ever, were eager for it to finish so that they could talk to Hagrid. 
They knew how much being made a teacher would mean to him. 
Hagrid wasn’t a fully qualified wi zard; he had been expelled from 
Hogwarts in his third year for a crime he ha d not committed. It 
had been Harry, Ron, and Hermione who had cleared Hagrid’s 
name last year. 
At long last, when the last morsels of pumpkin tart had melted 
from the golden platte rs, Dumbledore gave the word that it was 
time for them all to go to be d, and they got their chance. 
“Congratulations, Hagrid!” Hermione squealed as they reached 
the teachers’ table. 
“All down ter you three,” said Hagr id, wiping his shining face on 
his napkin as he looked up at them . “Can’ believe it . . . great man, 
Dumbledore . . . came straight down to me hut after Professor 
Kettleburn said he’d had enough. . . . It’s what I always wanted. . . .” 
Overcome with emotion, he buri ed his face in his napkin, and 
Professor McGonagall shooed them away. 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione joined the Gryffindors streaming up 
the marble staircase and, very tire d now, along more corridors, up 
more and more stairs, to the hidden entrance to Gryffindor Tower. 
A large portrait of a fat lady in a pink dress asked them, “Pass-
word?” 
“Coming through, coming throug h!” Percy called from behind 
the crowd. “The new password’s ‘Fortuna Major’!” 
 
THE DEMENTOR 
 95  “Oh no,” said Neville Longbottom sadly. He always had trouble 
remembering the passwords. 
Through the portrait hole an d across the common room, the 
girls and boys divided toward their separate staircases. Harry climbed 
the spiral stair with no thought in his head except how glad he was 
to be back. They reached their fa miliar, circular dormitory with its 
five four-poster beds, and Harry, looking around, felt he was home at last.

hen Harry, Ron, and Hermione entered the Great Hall 
for breakfast the next day, the first thing they saw was 
Draco Malfoy, who seemed to be entertaining a large group of Slytherins with a very funny stor y. As they passed, Malfoy did a 
ridiculous impression of a swoon ing fit and there was a roar of 
laughter. 
“Ignore him,” said Hermione, who was right behind Harry. 
“Just ignore him, it’s not worth it. . . .” 
“Hey, Potter!” shrieked Pansy Parkinson, a Slytherin girl with a 
face like a pug. “Potter! Th e dementors are coming, Potter! 
Woooooooo !” 
Harry dropped into a seat at the Gryffindor table, next to 
George Weasley. 
“New third-year course schedules,” said George, passing them 
over. “What’s up wi th you, Harry?” 
 W 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 97  “Malfoy,” said Ron, sitting dow n on George’s other side and 
glaring over at th e Slytherin table. 
George looked up in time to s ee Malfoy pretending to faint with 
terror again. 
“That little git,” he said calmly . “He wasn’t so cocky last night 
when the dementors were down at ou r end of the train. Came run-
ning into our compartment, didn’t he, Fred?” 
“Nearly wet himself,” said Fred, with a contemptuous glance at 
Malfoy. 
“I wasn’t too happy myself,” said George. “They’re horrible 
things, those dementors. . . .” 
“Sort of freeze yo ur insides, don’t they?” said Fred. 
“You didn’t pass out, though, did you?” said Harry in a low voice. 
“Forget it, Harry,” said George brac ingly. “Dad had to go out to 
Azkaban one time, remember, Fred? And he said it was the worst 
place he’d ever been, he came back all weak and shaking. . . . They suck the happiness out of a place, dementors. Most of the prison-
ers go mad in there.” 
“Anyway, we’ll see how happy Malf oy looks after our first Quid-
ditch match,” said Fred. “Gryffindor versus Slytherin, first game of 
the season, remember?” 
The only time Harry and Malfoy had faced each other in a 
Quidditch match, Malfoy had defi nitely come off worse. Feeling 
slightly more cheerful, Harry help ed himself to sausages and fried 
tomatoes. 
Hermione was examining her new schedule. 
“Ooh, good, we’re starting some new subjects today,” she said 
happily. 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 98  “Hermione,” said Ron, frowning as he looked over her shoulder, 
“they’ve messed up your schedu le. Look — they’ve got you down 
for about ten subjects a day. There isn’t enough time. ” 
“I’ll manage. I’ve fixed it al l with Professor McGonagall.” 
“But look,” said Ron, laughing, “see this morning? Nine o’clock, 
Divination. And underneath, ni ne o’clock, Muggle Studies. 
And” — Ron leaned closer to the schedule, disbelieving — “ look — 
underneath that, Arithmancy, nine o’clock. I mean, I know you’re 
good, Hermione, but no one’s that good. How’re you supposed to 
be in three clas ses at once?” 
“Don’t be silly,” said Hermione shortly. “Of course I won’t be in 
three classes at once.” 
“Well, then —” 
“Pass the marmalade,” said Hermione. 
“But —” 
“Oh, Ron, what’s it to you if my schedule’s a bit full?” Hermione 
snapped. “I told you, I’ve fixed it all with Professor McGonagall.” 
Just then, Hagrid entered the Great Hall. He was wearing his 
long moleskin overcoat and was absentmindedly swinging a dead 
polecat from one enormous hand. 
“All righ’?” he said eagerly, pausing on the way to the staff 
table. “Yer in my firs’ ever le sson! Right after lunch! Bin up 
since five gettin’ everythin’ ready. . . . Hope it’s okay. . . . Me, a 
teacher . . . hones’ly. . . .” 
He grinned broadly at them and headed off to the staff table, 
still swinging the polecat. 
“Wonder what he’s been getting ready?” said Ron, a note of anx-
iety in his voice. 
 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 99  The hall was starting to empty as people headed off toward their 
first lesson. Ron checke d his course schedule. 
“We’d better go, look, Divination ’s at the top of North Tower. 
It’ll take us ten minutes to get there. . . .” 
They finished their breakfasts hastily, said good-bye to Fred 
and George, and walked back th rough the hall. As they passed 
the Slytherin table, Malfoy did yet another impression of a faint-
ing fit. The shouts of laughter followed Harry into the entrance 
hall. 
The journey through the castle to North Tower was a long one. 
Two years at Hogwarts hadn’t ta ught them everything about the 
castle, and they had never been inside North Tower before. 
“There’s — got — to — be — a — shortcut,” Ron panted as 
they climbed their seventh long st aircase and emerged on an unfa-
miliar landing, where there was no thing but a large painting of a 
bare stretch of grass hanging on the stone wall. 
“I think it’s this way,” said Hermione, peering down the empty 
passage to the right. 
“Can’t be,” said Ron. “That’s sout h, look, you can see a bit of the 
lake out of the window . . .” 
Harry was watching the painting. A fat, dapple-gray pony had 
just ambled onto the grass and was grazing nonchalantly. Harry 
was used to the subjects of Hogwarts paintings moving around and leaving their frames to visit one another, but he always enjoyed watching it. A moment later, a short, squat knight in a suit of ar-
mor clanked into the picture after his pony. By the look of the grass stains on his metal knees, he had just fallen off. 
“Aha!” he yelled, seeing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “What 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 100  villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! Come to 
scorn at my fall, perchance? Draw, you knaves, you dogs!” 
They watched in astonishment as the little knight tugged his 
sword out of its scabbard and be gan brandishing it violently, hop-
ping up and down in rage. But th e sword was too long for him; a 
particularly wild swing made him overbalance, and he landed face-
down in the grass. 
“Are you all right?” sa id Harry, moving closer to the picture. 
“Get back, you scurvy braggart! Back, you rogue!” 
The knight seized his sword agai n and used it to push himself 
back up, but the blade sank deeply into the grass and, though he 
pulled with all his might, he couldn’t get it out again. Finally, he 
had to flop back down onto the grass and push up his visor to mop 
his sweating face. 
“Listen,” said Harry, taking ad vantage of the knight’s exhaus-
tion, “we’re looking for the North Tower. You don’t know the way, 
do you?” 
“A quest!” The knight’s rage se emed to vanish instantly. He 
clanked to his feet and shouted, “C ome follow me, dear friends, and 
we shall find our goal, or else shall perish bravely in the charge!” 
He gave the sword another fruitless tug, tried and failed to 
mount the fat pony, gave up, and cried, “On foot then, good sirs 
and gentle la dy! On! On!” 
And he ran, clanking loudly, into the left side of the frame and 
out of sight. 
They hurried after hi m along the corridor, following the sound 
of his armor. Every now and th en they spotted him running 
through a picture ahead. 
 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 101  “Be of stout heart, the worst is yet to come!” yelled the knight, 
and they saw him reappear in front of an alarmed group of women 
in crinolines, whose picture hung on the wall of a narrow spiral staircase. 
Puffing loudly, Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbed the tightly 
spiraling steps, getting dizzier and dizzier, unti l at last they heard 
the murmur of voices above them and knew they had reached the 
classroom. 
“Farewell!” cried the knight, popping his head into a painting of 
some sinister-looking monks. “Farewell, my comrades-in-arms! If 
ever you have need of noble hear t and steely sinew, call upon Sir 
Cadogan!” 
“Yeah, we’ll call you,” muttered Ron as the knight disappeared, 
“if we ever need someone mental.” 
They climbed the last few steps and emerged onto a tiny land-
ing, where most of the class was already assembled. There were no 
doors off this landing, but Ron nudged Harr y and pointed at the 
ceiling, where there was a circular trapdoor with a brass plaque 
on it. 
“ ‘Sibyll Trelawney, Divination teacher,’ ” Harry read. “How’re 
we supposed to get up there?” 
As though in answer to his question, the trapdoor suddenly 
opened, and a silvery ladder descende d right at Harry’s feet. Every-
one got quiet. 
“After you,” said Ron, grinni ng, so Harry climbed the ladder 
first. 
He emerged into the strangest- looking classroom he had ever 
seen. In fact, it didn’t look like a classroom at all, more like a cross 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 102  between someone’s attic and an ol d-fashioned tea shop. At least 
twenty small, circular tables were crammed inside it, all sur-
rounded by chintz armchairs and fat little poufs. Everything was lit with a dim, crimson light; the cu rtains at the windows were all 
closed, and the many lamps were dr aped with dark red scarves. It 
was stiflingly warm, and the fire that was burning under the crowded mantelpiece was giving off a heavy, sickly sort of perfume 
as it heated a large copper kettle. The shelves running around the circular walls were crammed with dusty-looking feathers, stubs of 
candles, many packs of tattered playing cards, countless silvery 
crystal balls, and a huge array of teacups. 
Ron appeared at Harry’s shoulder as the class assembled around 
them, all talking in whispers. 
“Where is she?” Ron said. A voice came suddenly out of the shadows, a soft, misty sort of 
voice. 
“Welcome,” it said. “How nice to see you in the physical world 
at last.” 
Harry’s immediate impression was of a large, glittering insect. 
Professor Trelawney moved into the firelight, and they saw that she 
was very thin; her large glasses magnified her eyes to several times 
their natural size, and she was draped in a gauzy spangled shawl. 
Innumerable chains and beads hung around her spindly neck, and 
her arms and hands we re encrusted with bangles and rings. 
“Sit, my children, sit,” she said , and they all climbed awkwardly 
into armchairs or sank onto poufs. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat themselves around th e same round table. 
“Welcome to Divination,” said Professor Trelawney, who had 
 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 103  seated herself in a winged armchair in front of the fire. “My name 
is Professor Trelawney. You may no t have seen me before. I find 
that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main 
school clouds my Inner Eye.” 
Nobody said anything to this extraordinary pronouncement. 
Professor Trelawney delicately rear ranged her shawl and continued, 
“So you have chosen to study Divina tion, the most difficult of all 
magical arts. I must warn you at the outset that if you do not have 
the Sight, there is very little I wi ll be able to teach you. Books can 
take you only so far in this field. . . .” 
At these words, both Harry an d Ron glanced, grinning, at 
Hermione, who looked startled at the news that books wouldn’t be 
much help in this subject. 
“Many witches and wizard s, talented though th ey are in the area 
of loud bangs and smel ls and sudden disappea rings, are yet unable 
to penetrate the veiled myster ies of the future,” Professor 
Trelawney went on, her enormous, gleaming eyes moving from 
face to nervous face. “It is a Gift granted to few. You, boy,” she said 
suddenly to Neville, who almost toppled off his pouf. “Is your 
grandmother well?” 
“I think so,” said Neville tremulously. 
“ I w o u l d n ’ t b e s o s u r e i f I w e r e y o u , d e a r , ” s a i d P r o f e s s o r 
Trelawney, the firelight glinting on her long emerald earrings. Neville gulped. Profes sor Trelawney continue d placidly. “We will 
be covering the basic methods of Divination this year. The first 
term will be devoted to reading the tea leaves. Next term we shall 
progress to palmistry. By the way, my dear,” she shot suddenly at Parvati Patil, “bewar e a red-haired man.” 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 104  Parvati gave a startled look at Ron, who was right behind her, 
and edged her chair away from him. 
“In the second term,” Professor Trelawney went on, “we shall 
progress to the crystal ball — if we have finished with fire omens, 
that is. Unfortunately, classes wi ll be disrupted in February by a 
n a s t y b o u t o f f l u . I m y s e l f w i l l l o s e m y v o i c e . A n d a r o u n d E a s t e r , 
one of our number will leave us forever.” 
A very tense silence followed this pronouncement, but Professor 
Trelawney seemed unaware of it. 
“I wonder, dear,” she said to Lavender Brown, who was nearest 
and shrank back in her chair, “if you could pass me the largest sil-
ver teapot?” 
Lavender, looking relieved, stood up, took an enormous teapot 
from the shelf, and put it down on the table in front of Professor 
Trelawney. 
“Thank you, my dear. Incid entally, that thing you are 
dreading — it will happen on Friday the si xteenth of October.” 
Lavender trembled. 
“Now, I want you all to divide into pairs. Collect a teacup from 
the shelf, come to me, and I will fill it. Then sit down and drink, 
drink until only the dregs remain. Swill these around the cup three 
times with the left hand, then turn the cup upside down on its 
saucer, wait for the last of the tea to drain away, then give your cup 
to your partner to read. You will interpret the patterns using pages 
five and six of Unfogging the Future. I shall move among you, help-
ing and instructing. Oh, and dear ” — she caught Neville by the 
arm as he made to stand up — “after you’ve broken your first cup, would you be so kind as to select one of the blue patterned ones? 
I’m rather attached to the pink.” 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 105  Sure enough, Neville had no sooner reached the shelf of tea-
cups when there was a tinkle of breaking china. Professor 
Trelawney swept over to him ho lding a dustpan and brush and 
said, “One of the blue ones, then, dear, if you wouldn’t 
mind . . . thank you. . . .” 
When Harry and Ron had had thei r teacups filled, they went 
back to their table and tried to dr ink the scalding te a quickly. They 
swilled the dregs around as Professor Trelawney had instructed, 
then drained the cups and swapped over. 
“Right,” said Ron as they both opened their books at pages five 
and six. “What can you see in mine?” 
“A load of soggy brown stuff,” said Harry. The heavily perfumed 
smoke in the room was making him feel sleepy and stupid. 
“Broaden your minds, my dears, and allow your eyes to see past 
the mundane!” Professor Trelaw ney cried through the gloom. 
Harry tried to pull himself together. “Right, you’ve got a crooked sort of cross . . .” He consulted 
Unfogging the Future. “That means you’re going to have ‘trials and 
suffering’ — sorry about that — bu t there’s a thing that could be 
the sun . . . hang on . . . that mean s ‘great happiness’ . . . so you’re 
going to suffer but be very happy. . . .” 
“You need your Inner Eye tested, if you ask me,” said Ron, and 
they both had to stifle their laughs as Professor Trelawney gazed in their direction. 
“My turn . . .” Ron peered into Harry’s teacup, his forehead 
wrinkled with effort. “There’s a blob a bit like a bowler hat,” he said. “Maybe you’re going to work for the Ministry of Magic. . . .” 
He turned the teacup the other way up. 
“But this way it looks more like an acorn. . . . What’ s that?” He 
CHAPTER SIX 
 106  scanned his copy of Unfogging the Future. “ ‘A windfall, unexpected 
gold.’ Excellent, you can lend me some . . . and there’s a thing 
here,” he turned the cup again, “tha t looks like an animal . . . yeah, 
if that was its head . . . it looks like a hippo . . . no, a sheep . . .” 
Professor Trelawney whirled around as Harry let out a snort of 
laughter. 
“Let me see that, my dear,” she said reprovingly to Ron, sweeping 
over and snatching Harry’s cup from him. Everyone went quiet 
to watch. 
Professor Trelawney was staring into the teacup, rotating it 
counterclockwise. 
“The falcon . . . my dear, you have a deadly enemy.” 
“But everyone knows that,” said Hermione in a loud whisper. 
Professor Trelawney stared at her. 
“Well, they do,” said Hermione . “Everybody know s about Harry 
and You-Know-Who.” 
Harry and Ron stared at her wi th a mixture of amazement and 
admiration. They had never heard Hermione speak to a teacher 
like that before. Prof essor Trelawney chose no t to reply. She low-
ered her huge eyes to Harry’s cup again and continued to turn it. 
“The club . . . an attack. Dear, dear , this is not a happy cup. . . .” 
“I thought that was a bowler hat,” said Ron sheepishly. 
“The skull . . . danger in your path, my dear. . . .” 
Everyone was staring, transfixed , at Professor Trelawney, who 
gave the cup a final turn, gasped, and then screamed. 
There was another tinkle of breaking china; Neville had 
smashed his second cup. Professo r Trelawney sank into a vacant 
armchair, her glittering hand at her heart and her eyes closed.

“What is it, Professor?” said Dean Thomas at once. Everyone 
had got to their feet, and slowly they crowded around Harry and 
Ron’s table, pressing close to Pr ofessor Trelawney’s chair to get a 
good look at Harry’s cup. 
“My dear,” Professor Trelawney’s huge eyes opened dramatically, 
“you have the Grim.” 
“The what?” said Harry. 
He could tell that he wasn’t the only one who didn’t understand; 
Dean Thomas shrugged at him and Lavender Brown looked puz-
zled, but nearly everybody else cla pped their hands to their mouths 
in horror. 
“The Grim, my dear, the Grim!” cried Professor Trelawney, who 
looked shocked that Ha rry hadn’t understood. “The giant, spectral 
d o g t h a t h a u n t s c h u r c h y a r d s ! M y d e a r b o y , i t i s a n o m e n — t h e

Harry’s stomach lurched. That dog on the cover of Death Omens 
in Flourish and Blot ts — the dog in the shadows of Magnolia 
Crescent . . . Lavender Brown clapped her hands to her mouth 
too. Everyone was looking at Harry, everyone except Hermione, 
who had gotten up and moved around to the back of Professor 
Trelawney’s chair. 
“I don’t think it looks like a Grim,” she said flatly. 
Professor Trelawney surveyed Hermione with mounting dislike. “You’ll forgive me for saying so, my dear, but I perceive very lit-
tle aura around you. Very little re ceptivity to the resonances of the 
future.” 
CHAPTER SIX

“It looks like a Grim if you do this ,” he said, with his eyes almost 
shut, “but it looks more like a do nkey from here,” he said, leaning 
to the left. 
“When you’ve all finished deciding whether I’m going to die or 
not!” said Harry, taking even hi mself by surprise. Now nobody 
seemed to want to look at him. 
“I think we will leave the lesson here for today,” said Professor 
Trelawney in her mistiest voice. “Y es . . . please pack away your 
things. . . .” 
Silently the class took their teac ups back to Professor Trelawney, 
packed away their books, and cl osed their bags. Even Ron was 
avoiding Harry’s eyes. 
“Until we meet again,” said Prof essor Trelawney faintly, “fair for-
tune be yours. Oh, an d dear” — she pointed at Neville — “you’ll 
be late next time, so mind you work extra-hard to catch up.” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione descended Professor Trelawney’s lad-
der and the winding stair in silence, then set off for Professor Mc-
Gonagall’s Transfiguration lesson. It took them so long to find her 
classroom that, early as they had left Divination, they were only 
just in time. 
Harry chose a seat ri ght at the back of the room, feeling as 
though he were sitting in a very bright spotlight; the rest of the 
class kept shooting furtive glances at him, as though he were about 
to drop dead at an y moment. He hardly heard what Professor 
McGonagall was telling them ab out Animagi (wiz ards who could 
transform at will into animals), and wasn’t even watching when she 
transformed herself in fr ont of their eyes into a tabby cat with spec-
tacle markings around her eyes.

 109  “Really, what has got into you all today?” said Professor Mc-
Gonagall, turning back in to herself with a faint pop, and staring 
around at them all. “Not that it ma tters, but that’s the first time my 
transformation’s not got applause from a class.” 
Everybody’s heads turned toward Harry again, but nobody spoke. 
Then Hermione ra ised her hand. 
“Please, Professor, we’ve just had our first Divination class, and 
we were reading the tea leaves, and —” 
“Ah, of course,” said Professor McGonagall, suddenly frowning. 
“There is no need to say any more , Miss Granger. Tell me, which of 
you will be dying this year?” 
Everyone stared at her. 
“Me,” said Harry, finally. 
“I see,” said Professor McGonaga ll, fixing Harry with her beady 
eyes. “Then you should know, Potter, that Sibyll Trelawney has predicted the death of one student a year since she arrived at this school. None of them has died yet. Seeing death omens is her 
favorite way of greeting a new class. If it were not for the fact that 
I never speak ill of my colleagues —” 
Professor McGonagall broke off, and they saw that her nostrils 
had gone white. She went on, more calmly, “Divination is one of 
the most imprecise branches of ma gic. I shall not conceal from you 
that I have very little patience with it. True Seers are very rare, and Professor Trelawney —” 
She stopped again, and then said , in a very matter-of-fact tone, 
“You look in excellent health to me , Potter, so you will excuse me if 
I don’t let you off homework today. I assure you that if you die, you 
need not hand it in.” 
Hermione laughed. Harry felt a bit better. It was harder to feel 
CHAPTER SIX

fuddling perfume of Professor Trelawney’s classroom. Not everyone 
was convinced, however. Ron stil l looked worried, and Lavender 
whispered, “But what about Neville’s cup?” 
When the Transfiguration class ha d finished, they joined the 
crowd thundering toward th e Great Hall for lunch. 
“Ron, cheer up,” said Hermione, pushing a dish of stew toward 
him. “You heard what Prof essor McGonagall said.” 
Ron spooned stew onto his plat e and picked up his fork but 
didn’t start. 
“Harry,” he said, in a low, serious voice, “you haven’t seen a great 
black dog anywhere, have you?” 
“Yeah, I have,” said Harry. “I saw one the night I left the 
Dursleys’.” 
Ron let his fork fall with a clatter. 
“Probably a stray,” sa id Hermione calmly. 
Ron looked at Hermione as though she had gone mad. 
“Hermione, if Harry’s seen a Grim, that’s — that’s bad,” he said. 
“My — my uncle Bilius saw one and — and he died twenty-four 
hours later!” 
“Coincidence,” said Hermione airily, pouring herself some 
pumpkin juice. 
“You don’t know what you’re talki ng about!” said Ron, starting 
to get angry. “Grims scare the livi ng daylights out of most wizards!” 
“There you are, then,” said Herm ione in a superior tone. “They 
see the Grim and die of fright. Th e Grim’s not an omen, it’s the 
cause of death! And Harry’s still with us because he’s not stupid 
enough to see one and think, right, well, I’d better kick the bucket then!” 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 111  Ron mouthed wordlessly at Hermione, who opened her bag, 
took out her new Arithmancy book , and propped it open against 
the juice jug. 
“I think Divination seems very woolly,” she said, searching for 
her page. “A lot of guesswork, if you ask me.” 
“There was nothing woolly about the Grim in that cup!” said 
Ron hotly. 
“You didn’t seem quite so confident when you were telling Harry 
it was a sheep,” said Hermione coolly. 
“Professor Trelawney said you didn’t have the right aura! You just 
don’t like being bad at something for a change!” 
He had touched a nerve. Hermione slammed her Arithmancy 
book down on the table so hard th at bits of meat and carrot flew 
everywhere. 
“If being good at Divination me ans I have to pretend to see 
death omens in a lump of tea leaves , I’m not sure I’ll be studying it 
much longer! That less on was absolute rubbish compared with my 
Arithmancy class!” 
She snatched up her bag and stalked away. 
Ron frowned after her. 
“What’s she talking about?” he said to Harry. “She hasn’t been to 
an Arithmancy class yet.” 
 
Harry was pleased to get out of the castle after lunch. Yesterday’s 
rain had cleared; the sky was a clear, pale gray, and the grass was 
springy and damp underfoot as they set off for their first ever Care 
of Magical Creatures class. 
Ron and Hermione weren’t speaking to each other. Harry walked 
beside them in silence as they went down the sloping lawns to 
CHAPTER SIX 
 112  Hagrid’s hut on the edge of the Forbidden Forest. It was only when 
he spotted three only-too-familiar ba cks ahead of them that he real-
ized they must be having these le ssons with the Slytherins. Malfoy 
was talking animatedly to Crabbe and Goyle, who were chortling. 
Harry was quite sure he knew what they were talking about. 
Hagrid was waiting for his class at the door of his hut. He stood 
in his moleskin overcoat, with Fa ng the boarhound at his heels, 
looking impatient to start. 
“C’mon, now, get a move on!” he called as the class approached. 
“Got a real treat for yeh today! Great lesson comin’ up! Everyone 
here? Right, follow me!” 
For one nasty moment, Harry thought that Hagrid was going to 
lead them into the forest; Harry had had enough unpleasant expe-
riences in there to last him a life time. However, Hagrid strolled off 
around the edge of the trees, and five minutes later, they found 
themselves outside a kind of paddo ck. There was nothing in there. 
“Everyone gather ’round the fence he re!” he called. “That’s it — 
make sure yeh can see — now, firs ’ thing yeh’ll want ter do is open 
yer books —” 
“How?” said the cold, drawli ng voice of Draco Malfoy. 
“Eh?” said Hagrid. “How do we open our books?” Malf oy repeated. He took out his 
copy of The Monster Book of Monsters, which he had bound shut with a length of rope. Other people took theirs out too; some, like 
Harry, had belted their book sh ut; others had crammed them in-
side tight bags or clamped them together with binder clips. 
“Hasn’ — hasn’ anyone bin able ter open their books?” said 
Hagrid, looking crestfallen. 
 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 113  The class all shook their heads. 
“Yeh’ve got ter stroke ’em,” said Hagrid, as though this was the 
most obvious thing in the world. “Look —” 
He took Hermione’s copy and ripped off the Spellotape that 
bound it. The book tried to bite, but Hagrid ran a giant forefinger 
down its spine, and the book shivered, and then fell open and lay quiet in his hand. 
“Oh, how silly we’ve all been!” Malfoy sneered. “We should have 
stroked them! Why didn’t we guess!” 
“I — I thought they were funny,” Hagrid said uncertainly to 
Hermione. 
“Oh, tremendously funny!” said Ma lfoy. “Really witty, giving us 
books that try and rip our hands off!” 
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Hagrid was looking 
downcast and Harry want ed Hagrid’s first lesson to be a success. 
“Righ’ then,” said Hagrid, who s eemed to have lost his thread, 
“so — so yeh’ve got yer books an’ — an’ — now yeh need the 
Magical Creatures. Yeah . So I’ll go an’ get ’em. Hang on . . .” 
He strode away from them into the fore st and out of sight. 
“God, this place is going to the dogs,” said Malfoy loudly. “That 
oaf teaching classes, my father’l l have a fit when I tell him —” 
“Shut up, Malfoy,” Harry repeated. 
“Careful, Potter, there’s a dementor behind you —” 
“Oooooooh!” squealed Lavender Br own, pointing toward the 
opposite side of the paddock. 
Trotting toward them were a dozen of the most bizarre creatures 
Harry had ever seen. They had the bodies, hind legs, and tails of 
horses, but the front legs, wings, an d heads of what seemed to be 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 114  giant eagles, with cruel, steel-color ed beaks and large, brilliantly or-
ange eyes. The talons on their front legs were half a foot long and 
deadly looking. Each of the beasts had a thick leather collar around 
its neck, which was attached to a lo ng chain, and the ends of all of 
these were held in the vast hands of Hagrid, who came jogging into 
the paddock behind the creatures. 
“Gee up, there!” he roared, shaking the chains and urging the 
creatures toward the fence wher e the class stood. Everyone drew 
back slightly as Hagrid reached them and tethered the creatures to 
the fence. 
“Hippogriffs!” Hagrid roared happily, waving a hand at them. 
“Beau’iful, aren’ they?” 
Harry could sort of see what Ha grid meant. Once you got over 
the first shock of seeing something that was ha lf horse, half bird, 
you started to appreciate the hippog riffs’ gleaming coats, changing 
smoothly from feather to hair, ea ch of them a different color: 
stormy gray, bronze, pinkish roan, gleaming chestnut, and inky black. 
“So,” said Hagrid, rubbing his hands together and beaming 
around, “if yeh wan’ ter come a bit nearer —” 
No one seemed to want to. Ha rry, Ron, and Hermione, how-
ever, approached the fence cautiously. 
“Now, firs’ thing yeh gotta know abou’ hippogriffs is, they’re 
proud,” said Hagrid. “Easily offended, hippogriffs are. Don’t never 
insult one, ’cause it migh t be the last thing yeh do.” 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle weren’t listening; they were talking 
in an undertone and Harry had a na sty feeling they were plotting 
how best to disrupt the lesson. 
 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 115  “Yeh always wait fer the hippogr iff ter make the firs’ move,” 
Hagrid continued. “It’s polite, se e? Yeh walk towa rd him, and yeh 
bow, an’ yeh wait. If he bows back , yeh’re allowed ter touch him. If 
he doesn’ bow, then get away fr om him sharpish, ’cause those 
talons hurt. 
“Right — who want s ter go first?” 
Most of the class backed farther away in answer. Even Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione had misgivings . The hippogriffs were tossing 
their fierce heads and flexing their powerful wings; they didn’t seem 
to like being tethered like this. 
“No one?” said Hagrid, with a pleading look. 
“I’ll do it,” said Harry. There was an intake of breath from behind him, and both 
Lavender and Parvati whispered, “Oooh, no , Harry, remember 
your tea leaves!” 
Harry ignored them. He climbe d over the paddock fence. 
“Good man, Harry!” roared Hagrid. “Right then — let’s see 
how yeh get on with Buckbeak.” 
He untied one of the chains, pulled the gray hippogriff away 
from its fellows, and slipped off it s leather collar. The class on the 
other side of the paddock seemed to be holding its breath. Malfoy’s 
eyes were narrowed maliciously. 
“Easy, now, Harry,” said Hagrid qu ietly. “Yeh’ve got eye contact, 
now try not ter blink. . . . Hippog riffs don’ trust yeh if yeh blink 
too much. . . .” 
Harry’s eyes immediately began to w a t e r , b u t h e d i d n ’ t s h u t 
them. Buckbeak had turned his great, sharp head and was staring 
at Harry with one fierce orange eye. 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 116  “Tha’s it,” said Hagrid. “Tha’s it, Harry . . . no w, bow . . .” 
Harry didn’t feel much like exposi ng the back of his neck to 
Buckbeak, but he did as he was to ld. He gave a short bow and then 
looked up. 
The hippogriff was still staring haug htily at him. It didn’t move. 
“Ah,” said Hagrid, sounding worri ed. “Right — back away, now, 
Harry, easy does it —” 
But then, to Harry’s enormous surprise, the hippogriff suddenly 
bent its scaly front knees and sank into what was an unmistakable 
bow. 
“Well done, Harry!” said Hagrid, ecstatic. “Right — yeh can 
touch him! Pat his beak, go on!” 
Feeling that a better reward would have be en to back away, 
Harry moved slowly toward the hi ppogriff and reac hed out toward 
it. He patted the beak several ti mes and the hippogriff closed its 
eyes lazily, as though enjoying it. 
The class broke into applause, all except for Malfoy, Crabbe, and 
Goyle, who were looking deeply disappointed. 
“Righ’ then, Harry,” said Hagrid . “ I r e c k o n h e m i g h t ’ l e t y e h 
ride him!” 
This was more than Harry had ba rgained for. He was used to a 
broomstick; but he wasn’t sure a hippogriff would be quite the 
same. 
“Yeh climb up there, jus’ behind the wing joint,” said Hagrid, 
“ a n ’ m i n d y e h d o n ’ p u l l a n y o f h i s f e a t h e r s o u t , h e w o n ’ l i k e that. . . .” 
Harry put his foot on the top of Buckbeak’s wing and hoisted 
himself onto its back. Buckbeak stood up. Harry wasn’t sure where 
to hold on; everything in front of him was covered with feathers. 
TALONS AND TEA LEAVES 
 117  “Go on, then!” roared Hagrid, slapping the hippogriff’s hind-
quarters. 
Without warning, twelve-foot wing s flapped open on either side 
of Harry; he just had time to se ize the hippogriff around the neck 
before he was soaring upward. It was nothing like a broomstick, 
and Harry knew which one he pr eferred; the hippogriff’s wings 
beat uncomfortably on either side of him, catching him under his 
legs and making him feel he was ab out to be thrown off; the glossy 
feathers slipped under his fingers an d he didn’t dare get a stronger 
grip; instead of the smooth action of his Nimbus Two Thousand, 
he now felt himself rocking backward and forward as the hindquar-
ters of the hippogriff rose and fell with its wings. 
Buckbeak flew him once around the paddock and then headed 
back to the ground; this was th e bit Harry had been dreading; he 
leaned back as the smooth neck lo wered, feeling he was going to 
slip off over the beak, then felt a he avy thud as the four ill-assorted 
feet hit the ground. He just manage d to hold on and push himself 
straight again. 
“Good work, Harry!” roared Hagrid as everyone except Malfoy, 
Crabbe, and Goyle cheered. “O kay, who else wants a go?” 
Emboldened by Harry’s success, the rest of the class climbed 
cautiously into the paddock. Hagr id untied the hippogriffs one by 
one, and soon people were bowing nervously, all over the paddock. 
N e v i l l e r a n r e p e a t e d l y b a c k w a r d f r o m h i s , w h i c h d i d n ’ t s e e m t o want to bend its knees. Ron and Hermione practiced on the chest-
nut, while Harry watched. 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had taken over Buckbeak. He had 
bowed to Malfoy, who was now patting his beak, looking dis-
dainful. 
CHAPTER SIX 
 118  “This is very easy,” Malfoy drawled, loud enough for Harry to 
hear him. “I knew it must have been, if Potter could do it. . . . I bet 
you’re not dangerous at all, are you?” he said to the hippogriff. “Are you, you great ugly brute?” 
It happened in a flash of steely talons; Malfoy let out a high-
pitched scream and next moment, Hagrid was wrestling Buckbeak 
back into his collar as he strained to get at Malfoy, who lay curled 
in the grass, blood blosso ming over his robes. 
“I’m dying!” Malfoy yelled as the class panicked. “I’m dying, 
look at me! It’s killed me!” 
“Yer not dyin’!” said Hagrid, who had gone very white. “Some-
one help me — gotta ge t him outta here —” 
Hermione ran to hold open the gate as Hagrid lifted Malfoy eas-
ily. As they passed, Harry saw that there was a long, deep gash on 
Malfoy’s arm; blood splattered the grass and Hagrid ran with him, up the slope toward the castle. 
Very shaken, the Care of Magical Creatures class followed at a 
walk. The Slytherins were all shouting about Hagrid. 
“They should fire him straight aw ay!” said Pansy Parkinson, who 
was in tears. 
“It was Malfoy’s fault!” snapped Dean Thomas. Crabbe and 
Goyle flexed their muscles threateningly. 
They all climbed the stone steps in to the deserted entrance hall. 
“I’ m going to see if he’ s okay!” said Pansy, and they all watched 
her run up the marble staircase. The Slytherins, still muttering 
about Hagrid, headed away in the direction of their dungeon 
common room; Harry, Ron, and Hermione proceeded upstairs 
to Gryffindor Tower.

 119  “D’you think he’ll be all righ t?” said Hermione nervously. 
“ ’Course he will. Madam Pomfrey can mend cuts in about a sec-
ond,” said Harry, who had had far worse injuries mended magically 
by the nurse. 
“That was a really bad thing to happen in Hagrid’s first class, 
though, wasn’t it?” said Ron, l ooking worried. “Trust Malfoy to 
mess things up for him. . . .” 
They were among the first to reach the Great Hall at dinner-
time, hoping to see Hagrid , but he wasn’t there. 
“They wouldn’t fire him, would they?” said Hermione anxiously, 
not touching her steak-and-kidney pudding. 
“They’d better not,” said Ron, who wasn’t eating either. 
Harry was watching the Slytherin ta ble. A large group including 
Crabbe and Goyle was huddled to gether, deep in conversation. 
Harry was sure they were cookin g up their own version of how 
Malfoy had been injured. 
“Well, you can’t say it wasn’t an interesting first day back,” said 
Ron gloomily. 
They went up to the crowded Gryffindor common room after 
dinner and tried to do the homework Professor McGonagall had 
given them, but all thre e of them kept breaking off and glancing 
out of the tower window. 
“There’s a light on in Hagrid’s window,” Harry said suddenly. 
Ron looked at his watch. 
“If we hurried, we could go down and see him. It’s still quite 
early. . . .” 
“I don’t know,” Hermione said slowly, and Harry saw her glance 
at him. 
 
CHAPTER SIX 
 120  “I’m allowed to walk across the grounds, ” he said pointedly. 
“Sirius Black hasn’t got past the dementors yet, has he?” 
So they put their things away and headed out of the portrait 
hole, glad to meet nobody on their way to th e front doors, as they 
weren’t entirely sure they were supposed to be out. 
The grass was still wet and looked almost black in the twilight. 
When they reached Hagrid’s hut, they knocked, and a voice 
growled, “C’min.” 
Hagrid was sitting in his shirts leeves at his scrubbed wooden 
table; his boarhound, Fang, had his head in Hagrid’s lap. One look 
told them that Hagrid had been drinking a lot; there was a pewter tankard almost as big as a bucket in front of him, and he seemed to 
be having difficulty ge tting them into focus. 
“ ’Spect it’s a record,” he said thickly, when he recognized them. 
“Don’ reckon they’ve ever had a te acher who lasted on’y a day be-
fore.” 
“You haven’t been fired, Hagrid!” gasped Hermione. 
“Not yet,” said Hagrid miserably, taking a huge gulp of whatever 
was in the tankar d . “ B u t ’ s o n l y a m a t t e r o’ time, i’n’t it, after 
Malfoy . . .” 
“How is he?” said Ron as they all sat down. “It wasn’t serious, 
was it?” 
“Madam Pomfrey fixed him best she could,” said Hagrid 
dully, “but he’s sayin’ it’s still agony . . . covered in ban-dages . . . moanin’ . . .” 
“He’s faking it,” said Harry at once. “Madam Pomfrey can mend 
anything. She regrew half my bones last year. Trust Malfoy to milk 
it for all it’s worth.”

“We’re witnesses,” said Harry. “You said hippogriffs attack if you

Dumbledore what really happened.” 
“Yeah, don’t worry, Hagrid, we ’ll back you up,” said Ron. 
Tears leaked out of the crinkled corners of Hagrid’s beetle-black 
eyes. He grabbed both Harry and Ron and pulled them into a 
bone-breaking hug. 
“I think you’ve had enough to drink, Hagrid,” said Hermione 
firmly. She took the tankard from the table and went outside to 
empty it. 
“Ar, maybe she’s right,” said Ha grid, letting go of Harry and 
Ron, who both staggered away, ru bbing their ribs. Hagrid heaved 
himself out of his chair and followed Hermione unsteadily outside. 
They heard a loud splash. 
“What’s he done?” said Harry nervously as Hermione came back 
in with the empty tankard. 
“Stuck his head in the water ba rrel,” said Hermione, putting the 
tankard away. 
Hagrid came back, his long hair and beard sopping wet, wiping

morning, when the Slytheri ns and Gryffindors were 
halfway through double Potions. He swaggered into the dungeon, 
his right arm covered in bandages and bound up in a sling, acting, 
in Harry’s opinion, as though he were the heroic survivor of some 
dreadful battle. 
“How is it, Draco?” simpered Pansy Parkinson. “Does it hurt 
much?” 
“Yeah,” said Malfoy, putting on a brave sort of grimace. But 
Harry saw him wink at Crabbe an d Goyle when Pansy had looked 
away. 
“Settle down, settle down,” said Professor Snape idly. 
Harry and Ron scowled at each othe r; Snape wouldn’t have said 
“settle down” if they’d walked in late, he’d have given them deten-

favored his own students above all others. 
They were making a new potion today, a Shrinking Solution. 
Malfoy set up his caul dron right next to Harry and Ro n, so tha t 
they were preparing their ingr edients on the same table. 
“Sir,” Malfoy called, “sir, I’ll ne ed help cutting up these daisy 
roots, because of my arm —” 
“Weasley, cut up Malfoy’s roots for him,” said Snape without 
looking up. 
Ron went brick red. 
“There’s nothing wrong with your arm,” he hissed at Malfoy. Malfoy smirked ac ross the table. 
“Weasley, you heard Professor Snape; cut up these roots.” Ron seized his knife, pulled Malf oy’s roots toward him, and be-
gan to chop them roughly, so that they were all different sizes. 
“Professor,” drawled Malfoy, “Wea sley’s mutilating my roots, 
sir.” 
Snape approached thei r table, stared down his hooked nose at 
the roots, then gave Ron an un pleasant smile from beneath his 
long, greasy black hair. 
“Change roots with Malfoy, Weasley.” “But, sir — !” 
Ron had spent the last quarter of an hour carefully shredding his 
own roots into exactly equal pieces. 
“Now, ” said Snape in his mo st dangerous voice. 
Ron shoved his own beautifully cut roots across the table at 
Malfoy, then took up the knife again. 
“And, sir, I’ll need this shrivelfig skinned,” said Malfoy, his voice 
full of malici ous laughter.

Harry the look of loathing he always reserved just for him. 
Harry took Malfoy’s shrivelfig as Ron began trying to repair the 
damage to the roots he now had to use. Harry skinned the shriv-
elfig as fast as he could and flung it back across the table at Malfoy 
without speaking. Malfoy was smirking more broadly than ever. 
“Seen your pal Hagrid lately?” he asked them quietly. 
“None of your business,” said Ron jerkily, without looking up. 
“I’m afraid he won’t be a teacher much longer,” said Malfoy in a 
tone of mock sorrow. “Father’s no t very happy about my injury —” 
“Keep talking, Malfoy, and I’ll give you a real injury,” snarled 
Ron. 
“— he’s complained to the school governors. And to the Min-
istry of Magic. Father’s got a lot of influence, you know. And a last-
ing injury like this” — he gave a huge, fake sigh — “who knows if 
my arm’ll ever be the same again?” 
“So that’s why you’re putting it on ,” said Harry, accidentally be-
heading a dead caterpillar because his hand was shaking in anger. 
“To try to get Hagrid fired.” 
“Well,” said Malfoy, lowering his voice to a whisper, “ partly, 
Potter. But there are other benefits too. Weasley, slice my caterpil-

A few cauldrons away, Neville was in trouble. Neville regularly 
went to pieces in Potions lessons; it was his worst subject, and his great fear of Professor Snape made things ten times worse. His po-

the verge of tears. 
“Please, sir,” said Hermione, “please, I could help Neville put it 
right —” 
“I don’t remember asking you to show off, Miss Granger,” said 
Snape coldly, and Hermione went as pink as Neville. “Longbot-
tom, at the end of this lesson we will feed a few drops of this potion 
to your toad and see what happen s. Perhaps that will encourage 
you to do it properly.” 
Snape moved away, leaving Neville breathless with fear. 
“Help me!” he moaned to Hermione. 
“Hey, Harry,” said Seamus Finnigan, leaning over to borrow 
Harry’s brass scales, “have you heard? Daily Prophet this morning — 
they reckon Sirius Bl ack’s been sighted.” 
“Where?” said Harry and Ron quickl y. On the other side of the 
table, Malfoy looked up, listening closely. 
“Not too far from here,” said Seamus, who looked excited. “It 
was a Muggle who saw him. ’Course, she didn’t really understand. 
The Muggles think he’s just an ordinary criminal, don’t they? So 
she phoned the telephone hot line. By the time the Ministry of Magic got there, he was gone.” 
“Not too far from here . . . ,” Ron repeated, looking significantly 
at Harry. He turned around an d saw Malfoy watching closely. 
“What, Malfoy? Need something else skinned?” 
 
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE 
 127  But Malfoy’s eyes were shining malevolently, and they were fixed 
on Harry. He leaned across the table. 
“Thinking of trying to catch Black single-handed, Potter?” 
“Yeah, that’s right,” said Harry offhandedly. 
Malfoy’s thin mouth was cu rving in a mean smile. 
“Of course, if it was me,” he sa id quietly, “I’d have done some-
thing before now. I wouldn’t be st aying in school like a good boy, 
I’d be out there looking for him.” 
“What are you talking about, Malfoy?” said Ron roughly. 
“Don’t you know, Potter?” breathed Malfoy, his pale eyes nar-
rowed. 
“Know what?” Malfoy let out a low, sneering laugh. 
“Maybe you’d rather not risk your neck,” he said. “Want to leave 
it to the dementors, do you? But if it was me, I’d want revenge. I’d 
hunt him down myself.” 
“What are you talking about ?” said Harry angrily, but at that 
moment Snape called, “You should have finished adding your 
ingredients by now; this potion needs to stew before it can be 
drunk, so clear away while it si mmers and then we’ll test Long-
bottom’s. . . .” 
Crabbe and Goyle laughed openly, watching Neville sweat as he 
stirred his potion feverishly. Herm ione was muttering instructions 
to him out of the corner of her mo uth, so that Snape wouldn’t see. 
Harry and Ron packed away their unused ingredients and went to 
wash their hands and ladles in the stone basin in the corner. 
“What did Malfoy mean?” Harry muttered to Ron as he stuck 
his hands under the icy jet that pour ed from the gargoyle’s mouth. 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 128  “Why would I want revenge on Blac k? He hasn’t done anything to 
me — yet.” 
“He’s making it up,” said Ron sa vagely. “He’s trying to make you 
do something stupid. . . .” 
The end of the lesson in sight, Snape strode over to Neville, who 
was cowering by his cauldron. 
“Everyone gather ’round,” said Snape, his black eyes glittering, 
“and watch what happens to Longbottom’s toad. If he has managed 
to produce a Shrinking Solution, it will shrink to a tadpole. If, as I 
don’t doubt, he has done it wrong, his toad is likely to be poi-
soned.” 
The Gryffindors watched fearfully . The Slytherins looked ex-
cited. Snape picked up Trevor the toad in his left hand and dipped 
a small spoon into Neville’s po tion, which was now green. He 
trickled a few drops do wn Trevor’s throat. 
There was a moment of hushed silence, in which Trevor gulped; 
then there was a small pop, and Trev or the tadpole was wriggling in 
Snape’s palm. 
The Gryffindors burst into applause. Snape, looking sour, pulled 
a small bottle from the pocket of his robe, poured a few drops on 
top of Trevor, and he reappe ared suddenly, fully grown. 
“Five points from Gryffindor,” said Snape, which wiped the 
smiles from every face. “I told yo u not to help him, Miss Granger. 
Class dismissed.” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione climbe d the steps to the entrance 
hall. Harry was still th inking about what Ma lfoy had said, while 
Ron was seething about Snape. 
“Five points from Gryffindor because the potion was all right! 
 
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE 
 129  Why didn’t you lie, Hermione? You should’ve said Neville did it all 
by himself!” 
Hermione didn’t answer. Ron looked around. 
“Where is she?” 
Harry turned too. They were at the top of the steps now, watch-
ing the rest of the class pass th em, heading for the Great Hall and 
lunch. 
“She was right behind us ,” said Ron, frowning. 
Malfoy passed them, walking between Crabbe and Goyle. He 
smirked at Harry and disappeared. 
“There she is,” said Harry. 
Hermione was panting slightly, hu rrying up the stairs; one hand 
clutched her bag, the other seemed to be tucking something down the front of her robes. 
“How did you do that?” said Ron. “What?” said Hermio ne, joining them. 
“One minute you were right behind us, the next moment, you 
were back at th e bottom of the stairs again.” 
“What?” Hermione looked slight ly confused. “Oh — I had to 
go back for something. Oh no —” 
A seam had split on Hermione’s bag. Harry wasn’t surprised; he 
could see that it was crammed with at least a dozen large and heavy 
books. 
“Why are you carrying all these around with you?” Ron asked 
her. 
“You know how many subjects I’m taking,” said Hermione 
breathlessly. “Couldn’t hold these for me, could you?” 
“But —” Ron was turning over the books she had handed him, 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 130  looking at the covers. “You haven’t got any of these subjects today. 
It’s only Defense Against the Dark Arts this afternoon.” 
“Oh yes,” said Hermione vaguely, but she packed all the books 
back into her bag just the same. “I hope there’s something good for 
lunch, I’m starving,” she added, and she marched off toward the 
Great Hall. 
“D’you get the feeling Hermione’s not telling us something?” 
Ron asked Harry. 
 
Professor Lupin wasn’t there when they arrived at his first Defense 
Against the Dark Arts lesson. They all sat down, took out their books, quills, and parchment, an d were talking when he finally en-
tered the room. Lupin smiled vaguely and placed his tatty old briefcase on the teacher’s desk. He was as shabby as ever but looked 
healthier than he had on the train, as though he had had a few square meals. 
“Good afternoon,” he said. “Would you please put all your 
books back in your bags. Today’s wi ll be a practical lesson. You will 
need only your wands.” 
A few curious looks were exchanged as the class put away their 
books. They had never had a prac tical Defense Against the Dark 
Arts before, unless you counted th e memorable class last year when 
their old teacher had brought a cage ful of pixies to class and set 
them loose. 
“Right then,” said Professor Lupi n, when everyone was ready. “If 
you’d follow me.” 
Puzzled but interested, the class got to its feet and followed Pro-
fessor Lupin out of the classroom. He led them along the deserted 
 
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE 
 131  corridor and around a corner, where the first thing they saw was 
Peeves the Poltergeist, who was floa ting upside down in midair and 
stuffing the nearest keyh ole with chewing gum. 
Peeves didn’t look up until Pr ofessor Lupin was two feet away; 
then he wiggled his curly-toed feet and broke into song. 
“Loony, loopy Lupin,” Peeves sang . “Loony, loopy Lupin, loony, 
loopy Lupin —” 
Rude and unmanageable as he almost always was, Peeves usually 
showed some respect toward the teachers. Everyone looked quickly at Professor Lupin to see how he would take this; to their surprise, 
he was still smiling. 
“I’d take that gum out of the keyhole if I were you, Peeves,” he 
said pleasantly. “Mr. Filch won’t be able to get in to his brooms.” 
Filch was the Hogwarts caretaker, a bad-tempered, failed wizard 
who waged a constant war against the students and, indeed, Peeves. 
However, Peeves paid no attentio n to Professor Lupin’s words, ex-
cept to blow a lo ud wet raspberry. 
Professor Lupin gave a small sigh and took out his wand. 
“This is a useful little spell,” he told the class over his shoulder. 
“Please watch closely.” 
He raised the wand to shoulder height, said, “ Waddiwasi !” and 
pointed it at Peeves. 
With the force of a bullet, the wad of chewing gum shot out of 
the keyhole and straight down Peeves ’s left nostril; he whirled up-
right and zoomed away, cursing. 
“Cool, sir!” said Dean Thomas in amazement. “ T h a n k y o u , D e a n , ” s a i d P r o f essor Lupin, putting his wand 
away again. “Shall we proceed?” 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 132  They set off again, the class l ooking at shabby Professor Lupin 
with increased respect. He led them down a second corridor and 
stopped, right outsid e the staffroom door. 
“Inside, please,” said Professor Lupin, opening it and standing 
back. 
The staffroom, a long, paneled room full of old, mismatched 
chairs, was empty except for one teacher. Professor Snape was sit-
ting in a low armchair, and he look ed around as the class filed in. 
His eyes were glittering and ther e was a nasty sneer playing around 
his mouth. As Professor Lupin came in and made to close the door 
behind him, Snape said, “Leave it open, Lupin. I’d rather not wit-ness this.” 
He got to his feet and strode pa st the class, his black robes bil-
lowing behind him. At th e doorway he turned on his heel and said, 
“Possibly no one’s warned you, Lupin, but this class contains 
Neville Longbottom. I would advise you not to entrust him with 
anything difficult. Not unless Miss Granger is hissing instructions 
in his ear.” 
Neville went scarlet. Harry glared at Snape; it was bad enough 
that he bullied Neville in his own cl asses, let alone doing it in front 
of other teachers. 
Professor Lupin had ra ised his eyebrows. 
“I was hoping that Neville would a ssist me with the first stage of 
the operation,” he said, “and I am sure he will perform it ad-mirably.” 
Neville’s face went, if possible, even redder. Snape’s lip curled, 
but he left, shutting the door with a snap. 
“Now, then,” said Professor Lupin, beckoning the class toward 
the end of the room, where there was nothing but an old wardrobe 
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE 
 133  where the teachers kept their spar e robes. As Professor Lupin went 
to stand next to it, the wardrobe gave a sudden wobble, banging off 
the wall. 
“Nothing to worry about,” said Professor Lupin calmly because 
a few people had jumped backward in alarm. “There’s a boggart in there.” 
Most people seemed to feel that this was something to worry 
about. Neville gave Professor Lu pin a look of pure terror, and 
Seamus Finnigan eyed the now rattling doorknob apprehensively. 
“Boggarts like dark, enclosed spaces,” said Professor Lupin. 
“Wardrobes, the gap beneath beds , the cupboards under sinks — 
I’ve even met one that had lodged itself in a grandfather clock. This 
one moved in yesterday afternoon, and I asked the headmaster if 
the staff would leave it to give my third years some practice. 
“So, the first question we must ask ourselves is, what is a bog-
gart?” 
Hermione put up her hand. 
“It’s a shape-shifter,” she said. “I t can take the shape of whatever 
it thinks will frighten us most.” 
“Couldn’t have put it better myse lf,” said Professor Lupin, and 
Hermione glowed. “So the boggart sitting in the darkness within 
has not yet assumed a form. He does not yet know what will 
frighten the person on the other side of the door. Nobody knows 
what a boggart looks like when he is alone, but when I let him out, 
he will immediately become what ever each of us most fears. 
“This means,” said Professor Lupi n, choosing to ignore Neville’s 
small sputter of terror, “that we have a huge advantage over the boggart before we begin. Ha ve you spotted it, Harry?” 
Trying to answer a question with Hermione next to him, 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 134  bobbing up and down on the balls of her feet with her hand in the 
air, was very off-putting, but Harry had a go. 
“Er — because there are so many o f u s , i t w o n ’ t k n o w w h a t 
shape it should be?” 
“Precisely,” said Professor Lupin, and Hermione put her hand 
down, looking a little disappointed. “It’s always best to have com-
pany when you’re dealing with a boggart. He becomes confused. 
Which should he become, a headless corpse or a flesh-eating slug? 
I once saw a boggart make that very mistake — tried to frighten 
two people at once and turned himself into half a slug. Not re-
motely frightening. 
“The charm that repels a boggart is simple , yet it requires force 
of mind. You see, the thing that really finishes a boggart is laughter. 
What you need to do is force it to assume a shape that you find 
amusing. 
“We will practice the charm without wands first. After me, 
please . . . riddikulus !” 
“Riddikulus !” said the class together. 
“Good,” said Professor Lupin. “Ver y good. But that was the easy 
part, I’m afraid. You see, the word alone is not enough. And this is 
where you come in, Neville.” 
The wardrobe shook again, though not as much as Neville, who 
walked forward as though he were heading for the gallows. 
“Right, Neville,” said Professor Lu pin. “First things first: what 
would you say is the thing that fr ightens you most in the world?” 
Neville’s lips moved, but no noise came out. “Didn’t catch that, Neville, sorry ,” said Professor Lupin cheer-
fully. 
Neville looked around rather wildly, as though begging someone 
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE 
 135  to help him, then said, in barely more than a whisper, “Professor 
Snape.” 
Nearly everyone laughed. Even Ne ville grinned apologetically. 
Professor Lupin, however, looked thoughtful. 
“Professor Snape . . . hmmm . . . Neville, I believe you live with 
your grandmother?” 
“Er — yes,” said Neville nervously. “But — I don’t want the 
boggart to turn into her either.” 
“No, no, you misunderstand me,” said Professor Lupin, now 
smiling. “I wonder, could you tell u s w h a t s o r t o f c l o t h e s y o u r 
grandmother usually wears?” 
Neville looked startled, but said, “Well . . . always the same hat. 
A tall one with a stuffe d vulture on top. And a long dress . . . green, 
normally . . . and sometimes a fox-fur scarf.” 
“And a handbag?” prompted Professor Lupin. 
“A big red one,” said Neville. “Right then,” said Professor Lupin. “Can you picture those 
clothes very clearly, Ne ville? Can you see them in your mind’s eye?” 
“Yes,” said Neville uncertainly, plainly wondering what was 
coming next. 
“When the boggart bursts out of t his wardrobe, Neville, and sees 
you, it will assume the form of Professor Snape,” said Lupin. “And 
you will raise your wand — thus — and cry ‘ Riddikulus ’ — and 
concentrate hard on your grandmot her’s clothes. If all goes well, 
Professor Boggart Snape will be fo rced into that vulture-topped 
hat, and that green dress, with that big red handbag.” 
There was a great shout of laughter. The wardrobe wobbled 
more violently. 
“If Neville is successful, the boggart is likely to shift his attention 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 136  to each of us in turn,” said Professor Lupin. “I would like all of you 
to take a moment now to think of the thing that scares you most, 
and imagine how you mi ght force it to look comical. . . .” 
The room went quiet. Harry th ought . . . What scared him 
most in the world? 
His first thought was Lord Vold emort — a Voldemort returned 
to full strength. But before he had even started to plan a possible 
counterattack on a boggart-Vol demort, a horrible image came 
floating to the surfac e of his mind. . . . 
A rotting, glistening hand, slithering back beneath a black 
cloak . . . a long, rattling breath from an unseen mouth . . . then a 
cold so penetrating it felt like drowning. . . . 
Harry shivered, then looked around, hoping no one had no-
ticed. Many people had their eyes shut tight. Ron was muttering to 
himself, “Take its legs off.” Harry wa s sure he knew what that was 
about. Ron’s greatest fear was spiders. 
“Everyone ready?” said Professor Lupin. 
Harry felt a lurch of fear. He wa sn’t ready. How could you make 
a dementor less frightening? But he didn’t want to ask for more 
time; everyone else was nodding and rolling up their sleeves. 
“Neville, we’re going to back away ,” said Professor Lupin. “Let 
you have a clear field, all right? I’ll call the next person for-ward. . . . Everyone back, now, so Neville can get a clear shot —” 
They all retreated, backed against the walls, leaving Neville 
alone beside the wardrobe. He look ed pale and frightened, but he 
had pushed up the sleeves of hi s robes and was holding his wand 
ready. 
“On the count of three, Neville,” said Professor Lupin, who was 
 
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE 
 137  pointing his own wand at the ha ndle of the wardrobe. “One — 
two — three — now!” 
A jet of sparks shot from the end of Professor Lupin’s wand and 
hit the doorknob. The wardrobe burst open. Hook-nosed and 
menacing, Professor Snape stepped ou t, his eyes flashing at Neville. 
Neville backed away, his wand up, mouthing wordlessly. Snape 
was bearing down upon him, reaching inside his robes. 
“R — r — riddikulus !” squeaked Neville. 
There was a noise like a whip crack. Snape stumbled; he was wear-
ing a long, lace-trimmed dress an d a towering hat topped with a 
moth-eaten vulture, and he was swinging a huge crimson handbag. 
There was a roar of laughter; th e boggart paused, confused, and 
Professor Lupin shouted, “Parvati! Forward!” 
Parvati walked forward, her face set. Snape rounded on her. 
There was another crack, and where he had stood was a blood-
stained, bandaged mummy; its sightl ess face was turned to Parvati 
and it began to walk to ward her very slowly, dragging its feet, its 
stiff arms rising — 
“Riddikulus !” cried Parvati. 
A bandage unraveled at the mumm y’s feet; it became entangled, 
fell face forward, an d its head rolled off. 
“Seamus!” roared Professor Lupin. Seamus darted past Parvati. 
Crack ! Where the mummy had been was a woman with floor-
length black hair and a skeletal, green-tinged face — a banshee. 
She opened her mouth wide and an unearthly sound filled the 
room, a long, wailing shriek that made the hair on Harry’s head 
stand on end — 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 138  “Riddikulus !” shouted Seamus. 
The banshee made a rasping noise and clutched her throat; her 
voice was gone. 
Crack ! The banshee turned into a rat, which chased its tail in a 
circle, then — crack ! — became a rattlesnake, which slithered and 
writhed before — crack ! — becoming a single, bloody eyeball. 
“It’s confused!” shouted Lupin. “We’re getting there! Dean!” 
Dean hurried forward. 
Crack ! The eyeball became a severe d hand, which flipped over 
and began to creep along the floor like a crab. 
“Riddikulus !” yelled Dean. 
There was a snap, and the hand was trapped in a mousetrap. 
“Excellent! Ron, you next!” 
Ron leapt forward. 
Crack ! 
Quite a few people screamed. A giant spider, six feet tall and cov-
ered in hair, was advancing on Ron, clicking its pincers menac-
ingly. For a moment, Harry th ought Ron had frozen. Then — 
“Riddikulus !” bellowed Ron, and the sp ider’s legs vanished; it 
rolled over and over; Lavender Br own squealed and ran out of its 
way and it came to a halt at Harry’ s feet. He raised his wand, ready, 
but — 
“Here!” shouted Professor Lupin suddenly, hurrying forward. 
Crack ! 
The legless spider had vanished. For a second, everyone looked 
wildly around to see where it was. Then they saw a silvery-white orb hanging in the air in fron t of Lupin, who said, “ Riddikulus !” al-
most lazily. 
 
THE BOGGART IN THE WARDROBE 
 139  Crack ! 
“Forward, Neville, and finish him off!” said Lupin as the boggart 
landed on the floor as a cockroach. Crack ! Snape was back. This 
time Neville charged forw ard looking determined. 
“Riddikulus !” he shouted, and they had a split second’s view of 
Snape in his lacy dress before Neville let out a great “Ha!” of laugh-
ter, and the boggart exploded, burst into a thousand tiny wisps of 
smoke, and was gone. 
“Excellent!” cried Professor Lu pin as the class broke into 
applause. “Excellent, Neville. Well done, everyone. . . . Let me 
see . . . five points to Gryffindor for every person to tackle the bog-
gart — ten for Neville because he di d it twice . . . and five each to 
Hermione and Harry.” 
“But I didn’t do anyt hing,” said Harry. 
“You and Hermione answered my questions correctly at the start 
of the class, Harry,” Lupin said ligh tly. “Very well, everyone, an ex-
cellent lesson. Homework, kindly read the chapter on boggarts and 
summarize it for me . . . to be ha nded in on Monday. That will be 
all.” 
Talking excitedly, th e class left the sta ffroom. Harry, however, 
wasn’t feeling cheerful. Professor Lupin had deliberately stopped him from tackling the boggart. Why? Was it because he’d seen 
Harry collapse on the train, and thought he wasn’t up to much? 
Had he thought Harry wo uld pass out again? 
But no one else seemed to have noticed anything. 
“Did you see me ta ke that banshee?” shouted Seamus. 
“And the hand!” said Dean , waving his own around. 
“And Snape in that hat!” 
 
CHAPTER SEVEN 
 140  “And my mummy!” 
“I wonder why Professor Lupin’s frightened of crystal balls?” said 
Lavender thoughtfully. 
“That was the best Defense Agains t the Dark Arts lesson we’ve 
ever had, wasn’t it?” said Ron excitedly as they made their way back 
to the classroom to get their bags. 
“He seems like a very good teache r,” said Hermione approvingly. 
“But I wish I could have had a turn with the boggart —” 
“What would it have been for yo u?” said Ron, sniggering. “A 
piece of homework that only got nine out of ten?” 
C H A P T E R E I G H T 
 
 141  FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 
 
 
n no time at all, Defense Against the Dark Arts had become most people’s favorite class. Only Draco Malfoy and his gang 
of Slytherins had anything bad to say about Professor Lupin. 
“Look at the state of his robes, ” Malfoy would say in a loud 
whisper as Professor Lupin passed. “He dresses like our old house-
elf.” 
But no one else cared that Profe ssor Lupin’s robes were patched and 
frayed. His next few lessons were just as interesting as the first. After 
boggarts, they studied Red Caps, nast y little goblinlike creatures that 
lurked wherever there had been bloodshed: in the dungeons of castles 
and the potholes of deserted battlefields, waiting to bludgeon those 
who had gotten lost. From Red Ca ps they moved on to kappas, 
creepy water-dwellers that looked like scaly monkeys, with webbed 
hands itching to strangle unwitting waders in their ponds. 
Harry only wished he was as ha ppy with some of his other 
 I 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 142  classes. Worst of all was Potions. Snape was in a particularly vin-
dictive mood these days, and no one was in any doubt why. The 
story of the boggart assuming Sn ape’s shape, and the way that 
Neville had dresse d it in his grandmother’ s clothes, had traveled 
through the school like wildfire. Snap e didn’t seem to find it funny. 
His eyes flashed menacingly at the very mention of Professor 
Lupin’s name, and he was bullyi ng Neville worse than ever. 
Harry was also growing to dread th e hours he spent in Professor 
Trelawney’s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes and 
symbols, trying to ignore the way Professor Trelawney’s enormous 
eyes filled with tears every time sh e looked at him. He couldn’t like 
Professor Trelawney, even though she was treated with respect bor-
dering on reverence by many of the class. Parvati Patil and Laven-
der Brown had taken to haunting Professor Trelawney’s tower room 
at lunchtimes, and always returned with annoyingly superior looks 
on their faces, as though they kn ew things the others didn’t. They 
had also started using hushed voic es whenever they spoke to Harry, 
as though he were on his deathbed. 
Nobody really liked Care of Magical Creatures, which, after the 
action-packed first class, had become extremely dull. Hagrid 
seemed to have lost his confidenc e. They were now spending lesson 
after lesson learning how to look after flobberworms, which had to 
be some of the most boring creatures in existence. 
“Why would anyone bother looking after them?” said Ron, after 
yet another hour of poking shredded lettuce down the flobber-worms’ slimy throats. 
At the start of October, however, Harry had something else to 
occupy him, something so enjoyable it more than made up for his 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 143  unsatisfactory classes. The Quidditch season was approaching, and 
Oliver Wood, Captain of the G ryffindor team, called a meeting 
one Thursday evening to discu ss tactics for the new season. 
There were seven people on a Quidditch team: three Chasers, 
whose job it was to score goals by putting the Quaffle (a red, 
soccer-sized ball) thro ugh one of the fifty-foot-high hoops at each 
end of the field; two Beaters, wh o were equipped with heavy bats 
to repel the Bludgers (two heavy black balls that zoomed around 
trying to attack the players); a Keeper, who de fended the goal 
posts, and the Seeker, who had the hardest job of all, that of catch-
ing the Golden Snitch, a tiny, wi nged, walnut-sized ball, whose 
capture ended the game and earned the Seeker’s team an extra one 
hundred and fifty points. 
Oliver Wood was a burly seventeen-year-old, now in his seventh 
and final year at Hogwarts. There was a quiet sort of desperation in his voice as he addressed his six fellow team members in the chilly 
locker rooms on the edge of the darkening Quidditch field. 
“This is our last chance — my last chance — to win the Quid-
ditch Cup,” he told them, striding up and down in front of them. 
“I’ll be leaving at the end of this year. I’ll never get another shot 
at it. 
“Gryffindor hasn’t won for seven years now. Okay, so we’ve had 
the worst luck in the world — injuries — then the tournament 
getting called off last year. . . .” Wood swallowed, as though 
the memory still brought a lump to his throat. “But we also know 
we’ve got the best — ruddy — team — in — the — school, ” he 
said, punching a fist into his ot her hand, the old manic glint back 
in his eye. 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 144  “We’ve got three superb Chasers.” 
Wood pointed at Alicia Spinnet, Angelina Johnson, and Katie 
Bell. 
“We’ve got two unbeatable Beaters.” 
“Stop it, Oliver, you’re embarrassing us,” said Fred and George 
Weasley together, pretending to blush. 
“And we’ve got a Seeker who has never failed to win us a match !” 
Wood rumbled, glaring at Harry with a kind of furious pride. “And 
me,” he added as an afterthought. 
“We think you’re very good t oo, Oliver,” said George. 
“Spanking good Keeper,” said Fred. 
“The point is,” Wood went on, re suming his pacing, “the Quid-
ditch Cup should have had our name on it these last two years. Ever since Harry joined the team, I’ve thought the thing was in the 
bag. But we haven’t got it, and this year’s the last chance we’ll get to 
finally see our name on the thing. . . .” 
Wood spoke so dejectedly that even Fred and George looked 
sympathetic. 
“Oliver, this year’s our year,” said Fred. 
“We’ll do it, Oliver !” said Angelina. 
“Definitely,” said Harry. Full of determination, the team started training sessions, three 
evenings a week. The weather was getting colder and wetter, the 
nights darker, but no amount of mud, wind, or rain could tarnish 
Harry’s wonderful vision of finall y winning the huge, silver Quid-
ditch Cup. 
Harry returned to the Gryffin dor common room one evening 
after training, cold and stiff but pleased with the way practice had 
gone, to find the room buzzing excitedly. 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 145  “What’s happened?” he asked Ron and Hermione, who were sit-
ting in two of the best chairs by the fireside and completing some 
star charts for Astronomy. 
“First Hogsmeade weekend,” said Ro n, pointing at a notice that 
had appeared on the battered old bu lletin board. “End of October. 
Halloween.” 
“Excellent,” said Fred, who had followed Harry through the por-
trait hole. “I need to visit Zonko’s. I’m nearly out of Stink Pellets.” 
Harry threw himself into a chair beside Ron, his high spirits 
ebbing away. Hermione seemed to read his mind. 
“Harry, I’m sure you’ll be able to go next time,” she said. “They’re 
bound to catch Black soon. He’s been sighted once already” 
“Black’s not fool enough to tr y anything in Hogsmeade,” said 
Ron. “Ask McGonagall if you can go this time, Harry. The next 
one might not be for ages —” 
“Ron!” said Hermione. “Ha rry’s supposed to stay in school —” 
“He can’t be the only third year left behind,” said Ron. “Ask 
McGonagall, go on, Harry —” 
“Yeah, I think I will,” said Harry, making up his mind. 
Hermione opened her mouth to argue, but at that moment 
Crookshanks leapt lightly onto her lap. A large, dead spider was 
dangling from his mouth. 
“Does he have to eat that in fr ont of us?” said Ron, scowling. 
“Clever Crookshanks, did you catch that all by yourself?” said 
Hermione. 
Crookshanks slowly chewed up th e spider, his yellow eyes fixed 
insolently on Ron. 
“Just keep him over there, that’s all,” said Ron irritably, turning 
back to his star char t. “I’ve got Scabbers asleep in my bag.” 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 146  Harry yawned. He really wanted to go to bed, but he still had his 
own star chart to complete. He pu lled his bag toward him, took 
out parchment, ink, and quill, and started work. 
“You can copy mine, if you like,” said Ron, labeling his last star 
with a flourish and shoving the chart toward Harry. 
Hermione, who disapproved of co pying, pursed her lips but 
didn’t say anything. Cr ookshanks was still star ing unblinkingly at 
Ron, flicking the end of his bushy tail. Then, without warning, he 
pounced. 
“OY!” Ron roared, seizin g his bag as Crookshanks sank four sets 
of claws deep inside it and bega n tearing ferociously. “GET OFF, 
YOU STUPID ANIMAL!” 
Ron tried to pull the bag away from Crookshanks, but Crook-
shanks clung on, spi tting and slashing. 
“Ron, don’t hurt him!” squeal ed Hermione; the whole common 
room was watching; Ron whirled the bag around, Crookshanks still clinging to it, and Scabbers came flying out of the top — 
“CATCH THAT CAT!” Ron yelled as Crookshanks freed him-
self from the remnants of the bag, sprang over the table, and chased 
after the terrified Scabbers. 
George Weasley made a lunge for Crookshanks but missed; 
Scabbers streaked through twenty pa irs of legs and shot beneath an 
old chest of drawers. Crookshanks skidded to a halt, crouched low 
on his bandy legs, and started ma king furious swip es beneath it 
with his front paw. 
Ron and Hermione hurried ov er; Hermione grabbed Crook-
shanks around the middle and heaved him away ; Ron threw him-
self onto his stomach and, with gr eat difficulty, pulled Scabbers out 
by the tail. 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 147  “Look at him!” he said furiously to Hermione, dangling Scab-
bers in front of her. “He’s skin and bone! You keep that cat away 
from him!” 
“Crookshanks doesn’t understand it’s wrong!” said Hermione, 
her voice shaking. “All cats chase rats, Ron!” 
“There’s something funny about that animal!” said Ron, who 
was trying to pers uade a frantically wiggling Scabbers back into his 
pocket. “It heard me say that Scabbers was in my bag!” 
“Oh, what rubbish,” said Herm ione impatiently. “Crookshanks 
could smell him, Ron, how else d’you think —” 
“That cat’s got it in for Scabbers!” said Ron, ignoring the people 
around him, who were starting to giggle. “And Scabbers was here 
first, and he’s ill!” 
Ron marched through the common room and out of sight up 
the stairs to the boys’ dormitories. 
 
Ron was still in a bad mood with Hermione next day. He barely 
talked to her all through Herbol ogy, even though he, Harry, and 
Hermione were working togeth er on the same puffapod. 
“How’s Scabbers?” Hermione asked timidly as they stripped fat 
pink pods from the plants and emptied the shining beans into a 
wooden pail. 
“He’s hiding at the bottom of my bed, shaking,” said Ron an-
grily, missing the pail and scatte ring beans over the greenhouse 
floor. 
“Careful, Weasley, careful!” crie d Professor Sprout as the beans 
burst into bloom befo re their very eyes. 
They had Transfiguration next. Harry, who had resolved to ask 
Professor McGonagall after the le sson whether he could go into 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 148  Hogsmeade with the rest, joined th e line outside the class trying to 
decide how he was going to argue his case. He was distracted, how-
ever, by a disturbance at the front of the line. 
Lavender Brown seemed to be crying. Parvati had her arm 
around her and was explaining something to Seamus Finnigan and Dean Thomas, who were looking very serious. 
“What’s the matter, Lavender?” said Hermione anxiously as she, 
Harry, and Ron went to join the group. 
“She got a letter from home this morning,” Parvati whispered. 
“It’s her rabbit, Binky. He ’s been kille d by a fox.” 
“Oh,” said Hermione, “I’m sorry, Lavender.” “I should have known!” said Lavender tragically. “You know 
what day it is?” 
“Er —” 
“The sixteenth of October! ‘That thing you’re dreading, it will 
happen on the sixteen th of October!’ Reme mber? She was right, 
she was right!” 
The whole class was gathered ar ound Lavender now. Seamus 
shook his head seriously. Hermione hesitated; then she said, 
“You — you were dreading Binky being killed by a fox?” 
“Well, not necessarily by a fox,” said Lavender, looking up at 
Hermione with streaming eyes, “but I was obviously dreading him 
dying, wasn’t I?” 
“Oh,” said Hermione. She paused again. Then — 
“Was Binky an old rabbit?” 
“N — no!” sobbed Lavender. “H — he was only a baby!” 
Parvati tightened her arm arou nd Lavender’s shoulders. 
“But then, why would you dread him dying?” said Hermione. 
Parvati glared at her. 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 149  “Well, look at it logically,” said Hermione, turning to the rest of 
the group. “I mean, Binky didn’t even die today, did he? Lavender 
just got the news today —” Lavend er wailed loudly. “— and she 
can ’t have been dreading it, because it’s come as a real shock —” 
“Don’t mind Hermione, Lavend er,” said Ron loudly, “she 
doesn’t think other people’s pets matter very much.” 
Professor McGonagall opened the classroom door at that mo-
ment, which was perhaps lucky; Hermione and Ron were looking 
daggers at each other, and when th ey got into class, they seated 
themselves on either side of Harry and didn’t talk to each other for 
the whole class. 
Harry still hadn’t decided what he was going to say to Professor 
McGonagall when the bell rang at the end of the lesson, but it was 
she who brought up the subj ect of Hogsmeade first. 
“One moment, please!” she called as the class made to leave. “As 
you’re all in my House, you should hand Hogsmeade permission forms to me before Halloween. No fo rm, no visiting the village, so 
don’t forget!” 
Neville put up his hand. 
“Please, Professor, I — I think I’ve lost —” 
“Your grandmother sent yours to me directly, Longbottom,” 
said Professor McGonagall. “She seemed to think it was safer. Well, 
that’s all, you may leave.” 
“Ask her now,” Ron hissed at Harry. 
“Oh, but —” Hermione began. 
“Go for it, Harry,” said Ron stubbornly. 
Harry waited for the rest of the class to disappear, then headed 
nervously for Professo r McGonagall’s desk. 
“Yes, Potter?” 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 150  Harry took a deep breath. 
“Professor, my aunt and uncle — er — forgot to sign my form,” 
he said. 
Professor McGonagall looked over her square spectacles at him 
but didn’t say anything. 
“So — er — d’you think it would be all right — I mean, will it 
be okay if I — if I go to Hogsmeade?” 
Professor McGonagall looked down and began shuffling papers 
on her desk. 
“I’m afraid not, Potter,” she said. “You heard what I said. No 
form, no visiting the vill age. That’s the rule.” 
“But — Professor, my aunt and uncle — you know, they’re 
Muggles, they don’t really understand about — about Hogwarts 
forms and stuff,” Harry said, whil e Ron egged him on with vigor-
ous nods. “If you said I could go —” 
“But I don’t say so,” said Profe ssor McGonagall, standing up and 
piling her papers neatly into a draw er. “The form clearly states that 
the parent or guardian must give permission.” She turned to look 
at him, with an odd expression on her face. Was it pity? “I’m sorry, 
Potter, but that’s my final word. Yo u had better hurry, or you ’ll be 
late for your next lesson.” 
 
There was nothing to be done. Ro n called Professor McGonagall a 
lot of names that greatly anno yed Hermione; Hermione assumed 
an “all-for-the-best” expression that made Ron even angrier, and 
Harry had to endure everyone in the class talking loudly and hap-
pily about what they were going to do first, once they got into 
Hogsmeade. 
 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 151  “There’s always the feast,” said Ron, in an effort to cheer Harry 
up. “You know, the Halloween feast, in the evening.” 
“Yeah,” said Harry gloomily, “great.” 
The Halloween feast was always good, but it wo uld taste a lot 
better if he was comi ng to it after a day in Hogsmeade with 
everyone else. Nothing anyone said made him feel any better about 
being left behind. De an Thomas, who was g ood with a quill, had 
offered to forge Uncle Vernon’s signature on the form, but as Harry 
had already told Professor McGonaga ll he hadn’t had it signed, that 
was no good. Ron halfheartedly suggested the Invisibility Cloak, but Hermione stamped on that one, reminding Ron what Dumb-ledore had told them about th e dementors bein g able to see 
through them. Percy had what were possibly the least helpful words of comfort. 
“They make a fuss about Hogsmeade, but I assure you, Harry, 
it’s not all it’s cracked up to be,” he said seriously. “All right, the 
sweetshop’s rather good, and Zonk o’s Joke Shop’s frankly danger-
ous, and yes, the Shrieking Shack’s always worth a visit, but really, 
Harry, apart from that, you’ re not missing anything.” 
 
On Halloween morning, Harry aw oke with the rest and went 
down to breakfast, feeling thoroughly depressed, though doing his 
best to act normally. 
“We’ll bring you lots of sweets back from Honeydukes,” said 
Hermione, looking desper ately sorry for him. 
“Yeah, loads,” said Ron. He and Hermione had fi nally forgotten 
their squabble about Crookshanks in the face of Harry’s difficul-
ties. 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 152  “Don’t worry about me,” said Harry, in what he hoped was an 
offhand voice, “I’ll see you at the feast. Have a good time.” 
He accompanied them to the entrance hall, where Filch, the 
caretaker, was standing inside th e front doors, checking off names 
against a long list, peering suspiciously into every face, and making 
sure that no one was sneaking out who shouldn’t be going. 
“Staying here, Potter?” shouted Ma lfoy, who was standing in line 
with Crabbe and Goyle. “Scare d of passing the dementors?” 
Harry ignored him and made his solitary way up the marble 
staircase, through the deserted co rridors, and back to Gryffindor 
Tower. 
“Password?” said the Fat Lady, jerking out of a doze. 
“Fortuna Major,” said Harry listlessly. 
The portrait swung open and he climbed through the hole into 
the common room. It was full of chattering first and second years, 
and a few older students, who had obviously visited Hogsmeade so 
often the novelty had worn off. 
“Harry! Harry! Hi, Harry!” 
It was Colin Creevey, a second ye ar who was deeply in awe of 
Harry and never miss ed an opportunity to speak to him. 
“Aren’t you going to Hogsmead e, Harry? Why not? Hey” — 
Colin looked eagerly around at his friends — “you can come and 
sit with us, if you like, Harry!” 
“Er — no, thanks, Colin,” said Ha rry, who wasn’t in the mood 
to have a lot of people staring avidly at the scar on his forehead. 
“I — I’ve got to go to the libra ry, got to get some work done.” 
After that, he had no choice but to turn right around and head 
back out of the portrait hole again. 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 153  “What was the point waking me up?” the Fat Lady called 
grumpily after him as he walked away. 
Harry wandered dispiritedly to ward the library, but halfway 
there he changed his mind; he didn ’t feel like working. He turned 
around and came face-to-face with Filch, who had obviously just 
seen off the last of the Hogsmeade visitors. 
“What are you doing?” Filch snarled suspiciously. 
“Nothing,” said Harry truthfully. 
“Nothing!” spat Filch, his jowls quivering unpleasantly. “A likely 
story! Sneaking around on your own — why aren’t you in Hogsmeade buying Stink Pellets and Belch Powder and Whizzing 
Worms like the rest of yo ur nasty little friends?” 
Harry shrugged. “ W e l l , g e t b a c k t o y o u r c o m m o n r o o m w h e r e y o u b e l o n g ! ” 
snapped Filch, and he stood glarin g until Harry had passed out of 
sight. 
But Harry didn’t go back to the common room; he climbed a 
staircase, thinking vaguely of visiting the Owlery to see Hedwig, 
and was walking along another corri dor when a voice from inside 
one of the rooms said, “Harry?” 
Harry doubled back to see who had spoken and met Professor 
Lupin, looking around his office door. 
“What are you doing?” said Lupi n, though in a very different 
voice from Filch. “Where are Ron and Hermione?” 
“Hogsmeade,” said Harry, in a would-be casual voice. 
“Ah,” said Lupin. He consid ered Harry for a moment. “Why 
don’t you come in? I’ve just take n delivery of a grindylow for our 
next lesson.” 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 154  “A what?” said Harry. 
He followed Lupin into his office. In the corner stood a very 
large tank of water. A sickly green creature with sharp little horns 
had its face pressed against the gl ass, pulling faces and flexing its 
long, spindly fingers. 
“Water demon,” said Lupin, surveying the grindylow thought-
fully. “We shouldn’t have much difficulty with him, not after the kappas. The trick is to break his grip. You notice the abnormally 
long fingers? Strong, but very brittle.” 
The grindylow bared its green teeth and then buried itself in a 
tangle of weeds in a corner. 
“Cup of tea?” Lupin said, looking around for his kettle. “I was 
just thinking of making one.” 
“All right,” said Harry awkwardly. Lupin tapped the kettle with hi s wand and a blast of steam 
issued suddenly from the spout. 
“Sit down,” said Lupin, taking the lid off a dusty tin. “I’ve 
only got teabags, I’m afraid — but I daresay you’ve had enough of 
tea leaves?” 
Harry looked at him. Lupin’ s eyes were twinkling. 
“How did you know abou t that?” Harry asked. 
“Professor McGonagall told me,” said Lupin, passing Harry a 
chipped mug of tea. “You ’re not worried, are you?” 
“No,” said Harry. 
He thought for a moment of te lling Lupin about the dog he’d 
seen in Magnolia Crescent but decided not to. He didn’t want Lupin to think he was a coward, especially since Lupin already 
seemed to think he couldn’t cope with a boggart. 
 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 155  Something of Harry’s thoughts seemed to have shown on his 
face, because Lupin said, “Any thing worrying you, Harry?” 
“No,” Harry lied. He drank a bit of tea and watched the grindy-
low brandishing a fist at him. “Yes ,” he said suddenly, putting his 
tea down on Lupin’s desk. “You know that day we fought the bog-
gart? 
“Yes,” said Lupin slowly. 
“Why didn’t you let me figh t it?” said Harry abruptly. 
Lupin raised his eyebrows. “I would have thought that was obvious, Harry,” he said, sound-
ing surprised. 
Harry, who had expected Lupin to deny that he’d done any such 
thing, was taken aback. 
“Why?” he said again. “Well,” said Lupin, frowning slig htly, “I assumed that if the bog-
gart faced you, it would assume the shape of Lord Voldemort.” 
Harry stared. Not only was this the last answer he’d expected, 
but Lupin had said Voldemort’s na me. The only person Harry had 
ever heard say the name aloud (apart from himself) was Professor 
Dumbledore. 
“Clearly, I was wrong,” said Lupin, still frowning at Harry. “But 
I didn’t think it a good idea for Lord Voldemort to materialize in 
the staffroom. I imagined that people would panic.” 
“I didn’t think of Voldemort,” said Harry honestly. “I — I 
remembered thos e dementors.” 
“I see,” said Lupin thoughtfully. “Well, well . . . I’m impressed.” 
He smiled slightly at the look of surprise on Harry’s face. “That 
suggests that what you fear most of all is — fear. Very wise, Harry.” 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 156  Harry didn’t know what to say to that, so he drank some more 
tea. 
“So you’ve been thinking that I didn’t believe you capable of 
fighting the boggart?” said Lupin shrewdly. 
“Well . . . yeah,” said Harry. He was suddenly feeling a lot hap-
pier. “Professor Lupin, yo u know the dementors —” 
He was interrupted by a knock on the door. 
“Come in,” called Lupin. 
The door opened, and in came Snape. He was carrying a goblet, 
which was smoking faintly, and sto pped at the sight of Harry, his 
black eyes narrowing. 
“Ah, Severus,” said Lupin, smiling. “Thanks very much. Could 
you leave it here on the desk for me?” 
Snape set down the smoking gobl et, his eyes wandering between 
Harry and Lupin. 
“I was just showing Harry my grin dylow,” said Lupin pleasantly, 
pointing at the tank. 
“Fascinating,” said Snape, without looking at it. “You should 
drink that dire ctly, Lupin.” 
“Yes, yes, I will ,” said Lupin. 
“I made an entire cauldronful, ” Snape continued. “If you need 
more.” 
“I should probably take some again tomorrow. Thanks very 
much, Severus.” 
“Not at all,” said Snape, but th ere was a look in his eye Harry 
didn’t like. He backed out of the room, unsmiling and watchful. 
Harry looked curiously at the goblet. Lupin smiled. 
“Professor Snape has very kindly concocted a potion for me,” he 
 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 157  said. “I have never been much of a potion-brewer and this one is 
particularly complex.” He picked up the goblet and sniffed it. “Pity 
sugar makes it useless,” he adde d, taking a sip and shuddering. 
“Why — ?” Harry began. Lupin looked at him and answered the 
unfinished question. 
“I’ve been feeling a bit off-color,” he said. “This potion is the 
only thing that helps. I am very lucky to be working alongside Pro-
fessor Snape; there aren’t many wi zards who are up to making it.” 
Professor Lupin took another si p and Harry had a crazy urge to 
knock the goblet out of his hands. 
“Professor Snape’s very interested in the Dark Arts,” he blurted 
out. 
“Really?” said Lupin, looking only mildly interested as he took 
another gulp of potion. 
“Some people reckon —” Harry hesitated, then plunged reck-
lessly on, “some people reckon he’d do anything to get the Defense 
Against the Dark Arts job.” 
Lupin drained the goblet and pulled a face. 
“Disgusting,” he said. “Well, Harry, I’d better get back to work. 
I’ll see you at the feast later.” 
“Right,” said Harry, putt ing down his empty teacup. 
The empty goblet was still smoking. 
 
“There you go,” said Ron. “We go t as much as we could carry.” 
A shower of brilliantly colored sw eets fell into Harry’s lap. It was 
dusk, and Ron and Hermione had just turned up in the common 
room, pink-faced from the cold wi nd and looking as though they’d 
had the time of their lives. 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 158  “Thanks,” said Harry, picking up a packet of tiny black Pepper 
Imps. “What’s Hogsmeade like? Where did you go?” 
By the sound of it — everywhere. Dervish and Banges, the wiz-
arding equipment shop, Zonko’s Jo ke Shop, into the Three Broom-
sticks for foaming mugs of hot butt erbeer, and many places besides. 
“The post office, Harry! About two hundred owls, all sitting on 
shelves, all color-coded depending on how fast you want your let-
ter to get there!” 
“Honeydukes has got a new kind of fudge; they were giving out 
free samples, there’s a bit, look —” 
“We think we saw an ogre, honestly, they get all sorts at the 
Three Broomsticks —” 
“Wish we could have brought you some butterbeer, really warms 
you up —” 
“What did you do?” said Hermione, looking anxious. “Did you 
get any work done?” 
“No,” said Harry. “Lupin made me a cup of tea in his office. And 
then Snape came in. . . .” 
He told them all about the goblet. Ron’s mouth fell open. 
“Lupin drank it ?” he gasped. “Is he mad?” 
Hermione checked her watch. 
“We’d better go down, you know, the feast’ll be starting in five 
minutes. . . .” They hurried throug h the portrait hole and into the 
crowd, still discussing Snape. 
“But if he — you know” — Hermione dropped her voice, 
glancing nervously around — “if he was trying to — to poison 
Lupin — he wouldn’t have do ne it in front of Harry.” 
“Yeah, maybe,” said Harry as they reached the entrance hall and 
 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 159  crossed into the Great Hall. It had been decorated with hundreds 
and hundreds of candle-filled pumpkins, a cloud of fluttering live 
bats, and many flaming orange st reamers, which were swimming 
lazily across the stormy ceiling like brillian t watersnakes. 
The food was delicious; even Hermione and Ron, who were full 
to bursting with Honeydukes sweets, managed second helpings of everything. Harry kept glancing at the staff table. Professor Lupin 
looked cheerful and as well as he ever did; he wa s talking animat-
edly to tiny little Professor Fl itwick, the Charms teacher. Harry 
moved his eyes along the table, to the place where Snape sat. Was 
he imagining it, or were Snape’s eyes flickering toward Lupin more 
often than was natural? 
The feast finished with an entertainment provided by the Hog-
warts ghosts. They popped out of th e walls and tables to do a bit of 
formation gliding; Nearly Headless Nick, the Gryffindor ghost, had a great success with a reenactment of his own botched be-heading. 
It had been such a pleasant evening that Ha rry’s good mood 
couldn’t even be spoiled by Malfoy, who shouted through the 
crowd as they all left the hall, “The dementors send their love, 
Potter!” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione followed the rest of the Gryffindors 
along the usual path to Gryffindor Tower, but when they reached the corridor that ende d with the portrait of the Fat Lady, they 
found it jammed with students. 
“Why isn’t anyone going in ?” said Ron curiously. 
Harry peered over the heads in front of him. The portrait 
seemed to be closed. 
 
CHAPTER EIGHT 
 160  “Let me through, please,” came Percy’s voice, and he came 
bustling importantly through the crowd. “What’s the holdup here? 
You can’t all have forgotten the password — excuse me, I’m Head Boy —” 
And then a silence fell over the crowd, from the front first, so 
that a chill seemed to spread dow n the corridor. They heard Percy 
say, in a suddenly sharp voice, “Somebody get Professor Dumble-
dore. Quick.” 
People’s heads turned; those at the back were standing on tip-
toe. 
“What’s going on?” said Ginn y, who had just arrived. 
A moment later, Professor Dumbledore was there, sweeping 
toward the portrait; the Gryffindors squeezed together to let him 
through, and Harry, Ron, and Herm ione moved closer to see what 
the trouble was. 
“Oh, my —” Hermione grabbed Harry’s arm. The Fat Lady had vanished from her portrait, which had been 
slashed so viciously that strips of canvas littered the floor; great 
chunks of it had been torn away completely. 
Dumbledore took one quick look at the ruined painting and 
turned, his eyes somber, to see Pr ofessors McGonagall, Lupin, and 
Snape hurrying toward him. 
“We need to find her,” said Dumbledore. “Professor McGona-
g a l l , p l e a s e g o t o M r . F i l c h a t o n c e a n d t e l l h i m t o s e a r c h e v e r y painting in the castle for the Fat Lady.” 
“You’ll be lucky!” said a cackling voice. It was Peeves the Poltergeist, bobbing over the crowd and look-
ing delighted, as he always did, at the sight of wreckage or worry. 
 
FLIGHT OF THE FAT LADY 
 161  “What do you mean, Peeves?” said Dumbledore calmly, and 
Peeves’s grin faded a little. He didn’t dare taunt Dumbledore. In-
stead he adopted an oily voice th at was no better than his cackle. 
“Ashamed, Your Headship, sir. Doesn’t want to be seen. She’s a 
horrible mess. Saw her running th rough the landscape up on the 
fourth floor, sir, dodging betw een the trees. Crying something 
dreadful,” he said happily. “Poo r thing,” he added unconvincingly. 
“Did she say who did it?” said Dumbledore quietly. 
“Oh yes, Professorhead,” said Peev es, with the air of one cradling 
a large bombshell in his arms. “He got ve ry angry when she 
wouldn’t let him in, you see.” Peev es flipped over and grinned at 
Dumbledore from between his own le gs. “Nasty temper he’s got, 
that Sirius Black.” 
C H A P T E R N I N E 
 
 162  GRIM DEFEAT 
 
 
 
rofessor Dumbledore sent all th e Gryffindors back to the 
Great Hall, where they were jo ined ten minutes later by the 
students from Hufflepuff, Rave nclaw, and Slytherin, who all 
looked extremely confused. 
“The teachers and I need to conduct a thorough search of the 
castle,” Professor Dumbledore told them as Professors McGonagall 
and Flitwick closed all doors into th e hall. “I’m afraid that, for your 
own safety, you will have to spen d the night here. I want the pre-
fects to stand guard over the entranc es to the hall and I am leaving 
the Head Boy and Girl in charge. Any disturbance should be re-
ported to me immediately,” he added to Percy, who was looking 
immensely proud and important. “Send word with one of the 
ghosts.” 
Professor Dumbledore paused, about to leave the hall, and said, 
“Oh, yes, you’ll be needing . . .” P 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 163  One casual wave of his wand an d the long tables flew to the 
edges of the hall and stood themse lves against the walls; another 
wave, and the floor was covered with hundreds of squashy purple 
sleeping bags. 
“Sleep well,” said Professor Du mbledore, closing the door be-
hind him. 
The hall immediately began to bu zz excitedly; the Gryffindors 
were telling the rest of the school what had just happened. 
“Everyone into their sleeping bags !” shouted Percy. “Come on, 
now, no more talking! Li ghts out in ten minutes!” 
“C’mon,” Ron said to Harry and Hermione; they seized three 
sleeping bags and dragge d them into a corner. 
“Do you think Black’s still in th e castle?” Hermione whispered 
anxiously. 
“Dumbledore obviously thinks he might be,” said Ron. “It’s very lucky he picked tonight, you know,” said Hermione as 
they climbed fully dressed into their sleeping bags and propped

“Didn’t realize it was Halloween. Otherwise he’d have come burst-
ing in here.” 
Hermione shuddered. 
All around them, people were asking one another the same ques-
tion: “ How did he get in ?” 
“Maybe he knows how to Apparate,” said a Ravenclaw a few feet 
away. “Just appear out of thin air, you know.” 
“Disguised himself, probably,” said a Hufflepuff fifth year. 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 164  “He could’ve flown in,” suggested Dean Thomas. 
“Honestly, am I the only person who’s ever bothered to read 
Hogwarts, A History ?” said Hermione cro ssly to Harry and Ron. 
“Probably,” said Ron. “Why?” “Because the castle’s protected by more than walls, you know,” 
said Hermione. “There are all sort s of enchantments on it, to stop 
people entering by stealth. You can’t just Apparate in here. And I’d like to see the disguise that could fool those dementors. They’re 
guarding every single entrance to the grounds. They’d have seen 
him fly in too. And Filch knows all the secret passages, they’ll have 
them covered. . . .” 
“The lights are going out now!” Pe rcy shouted. “I want everyone 
in their sleeping bags and no more talking!” 
The candles all went out at once . The only light now came from 
the silvery ghosts, who were drifting about talking seriously to the prefects, and the enchanted ceiling, which, like the sky outside, was 
scattered with stars. What with th at, and the whispering that still 
filled the hall, Harry felt as thou gh he were sleeping outdoors in a 
light wind. 
Once every hour, a teacher would reappear in the hall to check 
that everything was quiet. Arou nd three in the morning, when 
many students had finally fallen asleep, Professor Dumbledore 
came in. Harry watched him looking around for Percy, who had been prowling between the sleeping bags, telling people off for 
talking. Percy was only a short way away from Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione, who quickly pretended to be asleep as Dumbledore’s 
footsteps drew nearer. 
“Any sign of him, Professor? ” asked Percy in a whisper. 
 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 165  “No. All well here?” 
“Everything under control, sir.” 
“Good. There’s no point moving them all now. I’ve found a tem-
porary guardian for the Gryffindor po rtrait hole. You’ll be able to 
move them back in tomorrow.” 
“And the Fat Lady, sir?” “Hiding in a map of Argyllshire on the second floor. Apparently 
she refused to let Black in without the password, so he attacked. She’s still very distressed, but once she’s calmed down, I’ll have Mr. 
Filch restore her.” 
Harry heard the door of the hall creak open again, and more 
footsteps. 
“Headmaster?” It was Snape. Ha rry kept quite still, listening 
hard. “The whole of the third fl oor has been searched. He’s not 
there. And Filch has done the du ngeons; nothing there either.” 
“What about the Astronomy tower? Professor Trelawney’s room? 
The Owlery?” 
“All searched . . .” 
“Very well, Severus. I didn’t re ally expect Black to linger.” 
“Have you any theory as to ho w he got in, Professor?” asked 
Snape. 
Harry raised his head very slightly off his arms to free his other 
ear. 
“Many, Severus, each of them as unlikely as the next.” 
Harry opened his eyes a fraction an d squinted up to where they 
stood; Dumbledore’s back was to him , but he could see Percy’s face, 
rapt with attention, and Snape’s profile, which looked angry. 
“You remember the conversation we had, Headmaster, just 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 166  before — ah — the start of term?” said Snape, who was barely open-
ing his lips, as though trying to block Percy out of the conversation. 
“I do, Severus,” said Dumbledore, and there was something like 
warning in his voice. 
“It seems — almost impossible — that Black could have entered 
the school without inside help. I did express my concerns when 
you appointed —” 
“I do not believe a single person inside this castle would have 
helped Black enter it,” said Dumb ledore, and his tone made it so 
clear that the subject was closed that Snape didn’t repl y. “I must go 
down to the dementors,” said Dumbledore. “I said I would inform 
them when our search was complete.” 
“Didn’t they want to he lp, sir?” said Percy. 
“Oh yes,” said Dumbledore coldly. “But I’m afraid no dementor 
will cross the threshold of this castle while I am headmaster.” 
Percy looked slightly abashed. Dumbledore left the hall, walking 
quickly and quietly. Snape stood fo r a moment, watc hing the head-
master with an expression of deep resentment on his face; then he 
too left. 
Harry glanced sideways at Ron and Hermione. Both of them 
had their eyes open too, refl ecting the starry ceiling. 
“What was all that ab out?” Ron mouthed. 
 
The school talked of nothing but Sirius Black for the next few days. 
The theories about how he had en tered the castle became wilder 
and wilder; Hannah Abbott, from Hufflepuff, spent much of their next Herbology class telling anyo ne who’d listen that Black could 
turn into a flowering shrub. 
The Fat Lady’s ripped canvas had been taken off the wall and 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 167  replaced with the portrait of Si r Cadogan and his fat gray pony. 
Nobody was very happy about this. Sir Cadogan spent half his time 
challenging people to duels, and the rest thinking up ridiculously 
complicated passwords, which he changed at least twice a day. 
“He’s a complete luna tic,” said Seamus Fi nnigan angrily to 
Percy. “Can’t we get anyone else?” 
“None of the other pictures wanted the job,” said Percy. “Fright-
ened of what happened to the Fat Lady. Sir Cadogan was the only 
one brave enough to volunteer.” 
Sir Cadogan, however, was the le ast of Harry’s worries. He was 
now being closely watched. Teache rs found excuses to walk along 
corridors with him, and Percy Weas ley (acting, Harry suspected, 
on his mother’s orders ) was tailing him ever ywhere like an ex-
tremely pompous guard dog. To cap it all, Professor McGonagall 
summoned Harry into her office, with such a somber expression on her face Harry thought someone must have died. 
“There’s no point hiding it from you any longer, Potter,” she said 
in a very serious voice. “I know th is will come as a shock to you, 
but Sirius Black —” 
“ I k n o w h e ’ s a f t e r m e , ” s a i d H a rry wearily. “I heard Ron’s dad 
telling his mum. Mr. Weasley wo rks for the Ministry of Magic.” 
Professor McGonagall seemed ve ry taken aback. She stared at 
Harry for a moment or two, then sa id, “I see! Well, in that case, 
Potter, you’ll understand why I do n’t think it’s a good idea for you 
to be practicing Quidditch in th e evenings. Out on the field with 
only your team members, it’s very exposed, Potter —” 
“We’ve got our first match on Sa turday!” said Ha rry, outraged. 
“I’ve got to train, Professor!” 
Professor McGonagall considered him intently. Harry knew she 
CHAPTER NINE 
 168  was deeply interested in the Gryf findor team’s pr ospects; it had 
been she, after all, who’d suggested him as Seeker in the first place. 
He waited, holding his breath. 
“Hmm . . .” Professor McGonagall stood up and stared out of 
the window at the Quidditch field, just visible through the rain. 
“Well . . . goodness knows, I’d like to see us win the Cup at 
last . . . but all the same, Potter . . . I’d be happier if a teacher were 
present. I’ll ask Madam Hooch to oversee your training sessions.” 
 
The weather worsened steadily as the first Quidditch match drew 
nearer. Undaunted, the Gryffindor team was training harder than 
ever under the eye of Madam Hooch. Then, at their final training 
session before Saturday’s match, Oliver Wood gave his team some 
unwelcome news. 
“We’re not playing Slytherin!” he told them, looking very angry. 
“Flint’s just been to see me. We’re playing Hufflepuff instead.” 
“Why?” chorused the rest of the team. 
“Flint’s excuse is that their Seeker’s arm’s still injured,” said 
Wood, grinding his teeth furiously. “But it’s obvious why they’re 
doing it. Don’t want to play in this weather. T hink it’ll damage 
their chances. . . .” 
There had been strong winds an d heavy rain all day, and as 
Wood spoke, they heard a di stant rumble of thunder. 
“There’s nothing wrong with Malfoy’s arm!” said Harry furiously. 
“He’s faking it!” 
“I know that, but we can’t prov e it,” said Wood bitterly. “And 
we’ve been practicing all those moves assuming we’re playing 
Slytherin, and instead it’s Hufflep uff, and their style’s quite differ-
ent. They’ve got a new Captain and Seeker, Cedric Diggory —” 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 169  Angelina, Alicia, and Katie suddenly giggled. 
“What?” said Wood, frowning at this lighthearted behavior. 
“He’s that tall, good-looking on e, isn’t he?” said Angelina. 
“Strong and silent,” sa id Katie, and they started to giggle again. 
“He’s only silent because he’s t oo thick to string two words to-
gether,” said Fred impatiently. “I don’t know why you’re worried, 
Oliver, Hufflepuff is a pushover. La st time we played them, Harry 
caught the Snitch in about five minutes, remember?” 
“We were playing in completely different conditions!” Wood 
shouted, his eyes bulging slightly . “Diggory’s put a very strong side 
together! He’s an excellent Seeker! I was afraid you’d take it like this! We mustn’t relax! We must keep ou r focus! Slytherin is trying to 
wrong-foot us! We must win!” 
“Oliver, calm down!” said Fred, lo oking slightly alarmed. “We’re 
taking Hufflepuff very seriously. Seriously. ” 
 
The day before the ma tch, the winds reache d howling point and 
the rain fell harder than ever. It was so dark inside the corridors and 
classrooms that extra torches and lanterns were lit. The Slytherin 
team was looking very smug indeed, and none more so than Malfoy. 
“Ah, if only my arm was feeling a bit better!” he sighed as the 
gale outside poun ded the windows. 
Harry had no room in his head to worry about anything except 
the match tomorrow. Oliver Wood kept hurrying up to him be-
tween classes and giving him tips . The third time this happened, 
Wood talked for so long that Ha rry suddenly realized he was ten 
minutes late for Defense Against the Dark Arts, and set off at a run 
with Wood shouting after him, “D iggory’s got a very fast swerve, 
Harry, so you might want to try looping him —” 
CHAPTER NINE 
 170  Harry skidded to a halt outside the Defense Against the Dark 
Arts classroom, pulled the door open, and da shed inside. 
“Sorry I’m late, Professor Lupin, I —” 
But it wasn’t Professor Lupin who looked up at him from the 
teacher’s desk; it was Snape. 
“This lesson began ten minutes ago, Potter, so I think we’ll make 
it ten points from Gryffindor. Sit down.” 
But Harry didn’t move. “Where’s Professor Lupin?” he said. 
“He says he is feeling too ill to teach today,” said Snape with a 
twisted smile. “I believe I told you to sit down?” 
But Harry stayed where he was. “What’s wrong with him?” 
Snape’s black eyes glittered. 
“Nothing life-threatening,” he said, looking as though he 
wished it were. “Five more points from Gryffindor, an d if I have to 
ask you to sit down again, it will be fifty.” 
Harry walked slowly to his seat and sat down. Snape looked 
around at the class. 
“As I was saying before Potter interrupted, Professor Lupin has 
not left any record of the topi cs you have covered so far —” 
“Please, sir, we’ve done boggart s, Red Caps, kappas, and grindy-
lows,” said Hermione quickly, “and we’re just about to start —” 
“Be quiet,” said Snape coldly. “I did not ask for information. 
I was merely commenti ng on Professor Lupi n’s lack of organi-
zation.” 
“He’s the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve ever 
had,” said Dean Thomas boldly, an d there was a murmur of agree- 
 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 171  ment from the rest of the class. Snape looked more menacing than 
ever. 
“You are easily satisfied. Lupin is hardly overtaxing you — I 
would expect first years to be able to deal with Red Caps and 
grindylows. Today we shall discuss —” 
Harry watched him flick through th e textbook, to the very back 
chapter, which he must kn ow they hadn’t covered. 
“— werewolves,” said Snape. 
“But, sir,” said Hermione, seemingl y unable to restrain herself, 
“we’re not supposed to do werewolves yet, we’re due to start hinky-punks —” 
“Miss Granger,” said Snape in a voice of deadly calm, “I was un-
der the impression that I am teaching this le sson, not you. And I 
am telling you all to turn to page 394.” He glanced around again. 
“All of you! Now!” 
With many bitter sidelong looks and some sullen muttering, the 
class opened their books. 
“Which of you can tell me how we distinguish between the 
werewolf and the true wolf?” said Snape. 
Everyone sat in motionless silenc e; everyone except Hermione, 
whose hand, as it so often did, had shot straight into the air. 
“Anyone?” Snape said, ignoring Hermione. His twisted smile 
was back. “Are you telling me th at Professor Lupin hasn’t even 
taught you the basic distinction between —” 
“We told you,” said Parvati suddenly, “we haven’t got as far as 
werewolves yet, we’re still on —” 
“Silence !” snarled Snape. “Well, well, well, I never thought I’d 
meet a third-year class who wouldn ’t even recognize a werewolf 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 172  when they saw one. I shall make a point of informing Professor 
Dumbledore how very behind you all are. . . .” 
“Please, sir,” said Hermione, whose hand was still in the air, “the 
werewolf differs from the true wolf in several small ways. The snout 
of the werewolf —” 
“That is the second time you have spoken out of turn, Miss 
Granger,” said Snape coolly. “Five more points from Gryffindor for 
being an insufferab le know-it-all.” 
Hermione went very red, put down her hand, and stared at the 
floor with her eyes full of tears. It was a mark of how much the class 
loathed Snape that they were all glaring at him, because every one 
of them had called Hermione a know -it-all at least once, and Ron, 
who told Hermione she was a know-i t-all at least twice a week, said 
loudly, “You asked us a question and she knows the answer! Why 
ask if you don’t want to be told?” 
The class knew instantly he’d gone too far. Snape advanced on 
Ron slowly, and the ro om held its breath. 
“Detention, Weasley,” Snape said silkily, his face very close to 
Ron’s. “And if I ever hear you crit icize the way I teach a class again, 
you will be very sorry indeed.” 
No one made a sound throughout the rest of the lesson. They sat 
and made notes on werewolves from the textbook, while Snape 
prowled up and down the rows of desks, examining the work they 
had been doing with Professor Lupin. 
“Very poorly explained . . . That is incorrect, the kappa is more 
commonly found in Mongolia. . . . Professor Lupin gave this eight 
out of ten? I wouldn’t have given it three. . . .” 
When the bell rang at last, Snape held them back. 
 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 173  “You will each write an essay, to be handed in to me, on the ways 
you recognize and kill werewolves . I want two rolls of parchment 
on the subject, and I want them by Monday morning. It is time 
somebody took this class in hand. Weasley, stay behind, we need to 
arrange your detention.” 
Harry and Hermione left the room with the rest of the class, 
who waited until they were well out of earshot, then burst into a furious tirade about Snape. 
“Snape’s never been like this with any of our other Defense 
Against the Dark Arts teachers, even if he did want the job,” Harry 
said to Hermione. “Why’s he got it in for Lupin? D’you think this 
is all because of the boggart?” 
“I don’t know,” said Hermione pensively. “But I really hope Pro-
fessor Lupin gets be tter soon. . . .” 
Ron caught up with them five mi nutes later, in a towering rage. 
“D’you know what that —” (he called Sn ape something that 
made Hermione say “ Ron!”) “— is making me do? I’ve got to 
scrub out the bedpans in the hospital wing. Without magic !” He 
was breathing deeply, his fists clenched. “Why couldn’t Black have 
hidden in Snape’s office, eh? He could have finished him off 
for us!” 
 
Harry woke extremely early the next morning; so early that it was 
still dark. For a moment he thou ght the roaring of the wind had 
woken him. Then he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and 
sat bolt upright — Peeves the Polter geist had been floating next to 
him, blowing hard in his ear. 
“What did you do that for?” said Harry furiously. 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 174  Peeves puffed out his cheeks, bl ew hard, and zoomed backward 
out of the room, cackling. 
Harry fumbled for his alarm clock an d looked at it. It was half 
past four. Cursing Peeves, he rolled over and tried to get back to 
sleep, but it was very difficult, now that he was awake, to ignore the 
sounds of the thunder rumbling overhead, the pounding of the wind against the castle walls, and the distant creaki ng of the trees 
in the Forbidden Forest. In a few hours he would be out on the Quidditch field, battling through that gale. Finally, he gave up any 
thought of more sleep, got up, dr essed, picked up his Nimbus Two 
Thousand, and walked quie tly out of the dormitory. 
As Harry opened the door, something brushed against his leg. 
He bent down just in time to gr ab Crookshanks by the end of his 
bushy tail and dr ag him outside. 
“You know, I reckon Ron was r ight about you,” Harry told Crook-
shanks suspiciously. “There are plenty of mice around this place — 
go and chase them. Go on,” he added, nudging Crookshanks down 
the spiral staircase with his foot. “Leave Sc abbers alone.” 
The noise of the storm was even louder in the common room. 
Harry knew better than to thin k the match would be canceled; 
Quidditch matches weren’t called o ff for trifles like thunderstorms. 
Nevertheless, he was starting to feel very apprehensive. Wood had 
pointed out Cedric Diggory to him in the corridor; Diggory was a 
fifth year and a lot bi gger than Harry. Seekers were usually light 
and speedy, but Diggory’s weight wo uld be an advantage in this 
weather because he was less like ly to be blown off course. 
Harry whiled away the hours until dawn in front of the fire, get-
ting up every now and then to stop Crookshanks from sneaking up 
 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 175  the boys’ staircase again. At long la st Harry thought it must be time 
for breakfast, so he headed th rough the portrait hole alone. 
“Stand and fight, you mangy cur!” yelled Sir Cadogan. 
“Oh, shut up,” Harry yawned. 
He revived a bit over a large bowl of porridge, and by the time 
he’d started on toast, the rest of the team had turned up. 
“It’s going to be a tough one,” said Wood, who wasn’t eating 
anything. 
“Stop worrying, Oliver,” said Alicia soothingly, “we don’t mind 
a bit of rain.” 
But it was considerably more th an a bit of rain. Such was the 
popularity of Quidditch that the whole school turned out to watch the match as usual, but they ran down the lawns toward the Quid-
ditch field, heads bowe d against the ferociou s wind, umbrellas be-
ing whipped out of their hands as they went. Just before he entered the locker room, Harry saw Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, laughing and pointing at him from under an enormous umbrella on their 
way to the stadium. 
The team changed into their scarlet robes and waited for Wood’s 
usual pre-match pep talk, but it didn’t come. He tried to speak sev-
eral times, made an odd gulping noise, then shook his head hope-
lessly and beckoned them to follow him. 
The wind was so strong that they staggere d sideways as they 
walked out onto the field. If the crowd was cheering, they couldn’t 
hear it over the fresh rolls of th under. Rain was splattering over 
Harry’s glasses. How on earth was he going to see the Snitch in 
this? 
The Hufflepuffs were a pproaching from the opposite side of the 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 176  field, wearing canary-yellow robes. The Captains walked up to each 
other and shook hands; Diggory smiled at Wood but Wood now 
looked as though he had lock jaw and merely nodded. Harry saw 
Madam Hooch’s mouth fo rm the words, “Mount your brooms.” 
He pulled his right fo ot out of the mud with a squelch and swung 
it over his Nimbus Two Thousa nd. Madam Hooch put her whistle 
to her lips and gave it a blast that sounded shri ll and distant — 
they were off. 
Harry rose fast, but his Nimbus wa s swerving slightly with the 
wind. He held it as steady as he could and turned , squinting into 
the rain. 
Within five minutes Harry was so aked to his skin and frozen, 
hardly able to see his teammates, let alone the tiny Snitch. He flew backward and forward across the field past blurred red and yellow 
shapes, with no idea of what was happening in the rest of the game. 
He couldn’t hear the commentary over the wind. The crowd was 
hidden beneath a sea of cloaks and battered umbrellas. Twice Harry 
came very close to being unseated by a Bludger; his vision was so 
clouded by the rain on his glasse s he hadn’t seen them coming. 
He lost track of time. It was ge tting harder and harder to hold 
his broom straight. The sky was getting darker, as though night had 
decided to come early. Twice Har ry nearly hit another player, with-
out knowing whether it was a teammate or opponent; everyone was now so wet, and the rain so th ick, he could hardly tell them 
apart. . . . 
With the first flash of lightning came the sound of Madam 
Hooch’s whistle; Harry could just see the outline of Wood through the thick rain, gesturing him to the ground. The whole team 
splashed down into the mud. 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 177  “I called for time-out!” Wood ro ared at his team. “Come on, un-
der here —” 
They huddled at the edge of th e field under a large umbrella; 
Harry took off his glasses and wiped them hurriedly on his robes. 
“What’s the score?” 
“We’re fifty points up,” said Wood, “but unless we get the Snitch 
soon, we’ll be playin g into the night.” 
“I’ve got no chance with these on,” Harry said exasperatedly, 
waving his glasses. 
At that very moment, Hermione appeared at hi s shoulder; she 
was holding her cloak over her he ad and was, inexplicably, beam-
ing. 
“I’ve had an idea, Harry! Give me your glasses, quick!” 
He handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, 
Hermione tapped them wi th her wand and said, “ Impervius !” 
“There!” she said, handing them back to Harry. “They’ll repel 
water!” 
Wood looked as though he could have kissed her. 
“Brilliant!” he called hoarsely after her as she disappeared into 
the crowd. “Okay, team , let’s go for it!” 
Hermione’s spell had done the tr ick. Harry was still numb with 
cold, still wetter than he’d ever be en in his life, bu t he could see. 
Full of fresh determination, he urged his broom through the tur-bulent air, staring in every dire ction for the Snitch, avoiding a 
Bludger, ducking beneath Diggory, who was streaking in the oppo-
site direction. . . . 
There was another clap of thunder, followed immediately by 
forked lightning. This was getti ng more and more dangerous. 
Harry needed to get the Snitch quickly — 
CHAPTER NINE 
 178  He turned, intending to head back toward the middle of the field, 
but at that moment, another flash of lightning illuminated the 
stands, and Harry saw something that distracted him completely — 
the silhouette of an enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted 
against the sky, motionless in th e topmost, empty row of seats. 
Harry’s numb hands slipped on the broom handle and his Nim-
bus dropped a few feet. Shaking his sodden bangs out of his eyes, 
he squinted back into the stands. The dog had vanished. 
“Harry!” came Wood’s anguished yell from the Gryffindor goal 
posts. “Harry, behind you!” 
Harry looked wildly around. Cedr ic Diggory was pelting up the 
field, and a tiny speck of gold wa s shimmering in the rain-filled air 
between them — 
With a jolt of panic, Harry threw himself flat to the broom-
handle and zoomed toward the Snitch. 
“Come on!” he growled at his Ni mbus as the rain whipped his 
face. “ Faster !” 
But something odd was happening. An eerie silence was falling 
across the stadium. The wind, though as strong as ever, was forget-
ting to roar. It was as though someone had turned off the sound, as 
though Harry had gone suddenly deaf — what was going on? 
And then a horribly familiar wave of cold swept over him, inside 
him, just as he became aware of something moving on the field 
below. . . . 
Before he’d had time to think, Harry had taken his eyes off the 
Snitch and looked down. 
At least a hundred dementors, their hidden faces pointing up at 
him, were standing beneath him. It was as though freezing water 
 
GRIM DEFEAT 
 179  were rising in his chest, cutting at his insides. And then he heard it 
again. . . . Someone was screaming, screaming inside his head . . . a 
woman . . . 
“Not Harry, not Harry, please not Harry !” 
“Stand aside, you silly girl . . . stand aside, now. . . .” 
“Not Harry, please no, take me, kill me instead —” 
Numbing, swirling white mist was filling Harry’s brain. . . . What 
was he doing? Why was he flying? He needed to help her. . . . She 
was going to die. . . . She was going to be murdered. . . . 
He was falling, falling through the icy mist. 
“Not Harry ! Please . . . have mercy . . . have mercy. . . .” 
A shrill voice was laughing, the woman was screaming, and 
Harry knew no more. 
 
“Lucky the ground was so soft.” 
“I thought he was dead for sure.” 
“But he didn’t even break his glasses.” 
Harry could hear the voices whispe ring, but they made no sense 
whatsoever. He didn’t have a clue where he was, or how he’d got 
there, or what he’d been doing befo re he got there. All he knew was 
that every inch of him was aching as though it had been beaten. 
“That was the scariest thing I’ ve ever seen in my life.” 
Scariest . . . the scariest thing . . . hooded black figures . . . 
cold . . . screaming . . . 
Harry’s eyes snapped open. He was lying in the hospital wing. The 
Gryffindor Quidditch team, spattered with mud from head to foot, 
was gathered around his bed. Ron and Hermione were also there, looking as though they’d just climbed out of a swimming pool. 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 180  “Harry!” said Fred, who looked extremely white underneath the 
mud. “How’re you feeling?” 
It was as though Harry’s memory was on fast forward. The light-
ning — the Grim — the Snitch — and the dementors . . . 
“What happened?” he said, sitt ing up so suddenly they all 
gasped. 
“You fell off,” said Fred. “M ust’ve been — what — fifty feet?” 
“We thought you’d died,” said Alicia, who was shaking. 
Hermione made a small, squeaky noise. Her eyes were extremely 
bloodshot. 
“But the match,” said Harry. “W hat happened? Are we doing a 
replay?” 
No one said anything. The horrible truth sank into Harry like a 
stone. 
“We didn’t — lose?” 
“Diggory got the Snitch,” said Ge orge. “Just after you fell. He 
didn’t realize what had happened. When he looked back and saw 
you on the ground, he tried to call it off. Wanted a rematch. But 
they won fair and square . . . even Wood admits it.” 
“Where is Wood?” said Harry, suddenly realizing he wasn’t 
there. 
“Still in the showers,” said Fred. “We think he’s trying to drown 
himself.” 
Harry put his face to his knees, hi s hands gripping his hair. Fred 
grabbed his shoulder an d shook it roughly. 
“C’mon, Harry, you’ve never missed the Snitch before.” 
“There had to be on e time you didn’t get it,” said George. 
“It’s not over yet,” said Fred. “We lost by a hundred points,

 181  right? So if Hufflepuff loses to Ravenclaw and we beat Ravenclaw 
and Slytherin . . .” 
“Hufflepuff’ll have to lose by at least two hundred points,” said 
George. 
“But if they beat Ravenclaw . . .” 
“No way, Ravenclaw is too good. But if Slytherin loses against 
Hufflepuff . . .” 
“It all depends on th e points — a margin of a hundred either 
way —” 
Harry lay there, not saying a word. They had lost . . . for the first 
time ever, he had lost a Quidditch match. 
After ten minutes or so, Madam Pomfrey came over to tell the 
team to leave him in peace. 
“We’ll come and see you later,” Fred told him. “Don’t beat your-
self up, Harry, you’re still th e best Seeker we’ve ever had.” 
The team trooped out, trailing mud behind them. Madam Pom-
frey shut the door behind them, looking disapproving. Ron and 
Hermione moved nearer to Harry’s bed. 
“Dumbledore was really angry,” Hermione said in a quaking 
voice. “I’ve never seen him like that before. He ran onto the field as 
you fell, waved his wand, and you sort of slowed down before you 
hit the ground. Then he whirled his wand at the dementors. Shot 
silver stuff at them. They left th e stadium right away. . . . He was 
furious they’d come onto the grounds. We heard him —” 
“Then he magicked you onto a stretcher,” said Ron. “And 
walked up to school wi th you floating on it. Everyone thought you 
were . . .” 
His voice faded, but Harry hardly noticed. He was thinking 
 
CHAPTER NINE 
 182  about what the dementor s had done to him . . . about the scream-
ing voice. He looked up and saw Ron and Hermione looking 
at him so anxiously that he qu ickly cast around for something 
matter-of-fact to say. 
“Did someone get my Nimbus?” Ron and Hermione looked quickly at each other. 
“Er —” 
“What?” said Harry, lookin g from one to the other. 
“Well . . . when you fell off, it got blown away,” said Hermione 
hesitantly. 
“And?” 
“And it hit — it hit — oh, Ha rry — it hit the Whomping Wil-
low.” 
Harry’s insides lurched. The Whomping Willow was a very vio-
lent tree that stood alone in the middle of the grounds. 
“And?” he said, dr eading the answer. 
“Well, you know the Whomping Willow,” said Ron. “It — it 
doesn’t like being hit.” 
“Professor Flitwick brought it back just before you came 
around,” said Hermione in a very small voice. 
Slowly, she reached down for a bag at her feet, turned it upside 
down, and tipped a dozen bits of splintered wood and twig onto 
the bed, the only remains of Harr y’s faithful, finally beaten broom-
stick.

adam Pomfrey insisted on ke eping Harry in the hospital 
wing for the rest of the weekend. He didn’t argue or 
complain, but he wouldn’t let he r throw away the shattered rem-
nants of his Nimbus Two Thousand. He knew he was being stupid, knew that the Nimbus was beyond repair, but Harry couldn’t help 
it; he felt as though he’d lo st one of his best friends. 
He had a stream of visitors, al l intent on cheer ing him up. Ha-
grid sent him a bunch of earwiggy flowers that looked like yellow 
cabbages, and Ginny Weasley, blushing furiously, turned up with a get-well card she had made herself, which sang shrilly unless Harry 
k e p t i t s h u t u n d e r h i s b o w l o f f r uit. The Gryffindor team visited 
again on Sunday morning, this time accompanied by Wood, who 
told Harry (in a hollow, dead sort of voice) that he didn’t blame him in the slightest. Ron and Hermione left Harry’s bedside only 
at night. But nothing anyone said or did could make Harry feel any 
better, because they knew only ha lf of what was troubling him. M 
CHAPTER TEN 
 184  He hadn’t told anyone about the Grim, not even Ron and 
Hermione, because he knew Ro n would panic and Hermione 
would scoff. The fact remained, ho wever, that it had now appeared 
twice, and both appear ances had been followed by near-fatal acci-
dents; the first time, he had near ly been run over by the Knight 
Bus; the second, fallen fifty feet from his broomstick. Was the 
Grim going to haunt hi m until he actually di ed? Was he going to 
spend the rest of his life looking over his shoulder for the beast? 
And then there were the dementors. Harry felt sick and humili-
ated every time he thought of th em. Everyone said the dementors 
were horrible, but no one else co llapsed every time they went near 
one. No one else heard echoes in their head of their dying parents. 
Because Harry knew who that scre aming voice belonged to now. 
He had heard her words, heard them over an d over again during 
the night hours in the hospital wing while he lay awake, staring at 
the strips of moonlight on the ceiling. When the dementors ap-
proached him, he heard the last moments of his mother’s life, her 
attempts to protect him, Harry, from Lord Voldemort, and Volde-
mort’s laughter before he murdered her. . . . Harry dozed fitfully, 
sinking into dreams full of clammy, rotted hands and petrified 
pleading, jerking awake to dwell again on his mother’s voice. 
 
It was a relief to return to the noise and bustle of the main school 
on Monday, where he was forced to think about other things, even 
if he had to endure Draco Malfoy ’s taunting. Malfoy was almost 
beside himself with glee at Gryffi ndor’s defeat. He had finally taken 
off his bandages, and celebrated ha ving the full us e of both arms 
again by doing spirited imitations of Harry falling off his broom. 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 185  Malfoy spent much of their next Potions class doing dementor im-
itations across the dungeon; Ron fi nally cracked and flung a large, 
slippery crocodile heart at Malfoy, which hit him in the face and 
caused Snape to take fift y points from Gryffindor. 
“If Snape’s teaching Defense Against the Dark Arts again, I’m 
skiving off,” said Ron as they headed towa rd Lupin’s classroom af-
ter lunch. “Check who’s in there, Hermione.” 
Hermione peered around the classroom door. “It’s okay!” 
Professor Lupin was back at work. It certainly looked as though 
he had been ill. His old robes we re hanging more loosely on him 
and there were dark shadows benea th his eyes; nevertheless, he 
smiled at the class as they took th eir seats, and they burst at once 
into an explosion of complaints about Snape’s behavior while Lupin had been ill. 
“It’s not fair, he was only filling in, why should he give us home-
work?” 
“We don’t know anything about werewolves —” 
“— two rolls of parchment!” 
“Did you tell Professor Snape we haven’t covered them yet?” 
Lupin asked, frowning slightly. 
The babble broke out again. 
“Yes, but he said we were really behind —” 
“— he wouldn’t listen —” “— two rolls of parchment !” 
Professor Lupin smiled at the look of indignation on every face. 
“Don’t worry. I’ll speak to Professor Snape. You don’t have to do 
the essay.” 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 186  “Oh no,” said Hermione, looking ve ry disappointed. “I’ve al-
ready finished it!” 
They had a very enjoyable lesson. Professor Lupin had brought 
along a glass box containing a hink ypunk, a little one-legged crea-
ture who looked as though he were made of wisps of smoke, rather 
frail and harmless-looking. 
“Lures travelers into bogs,” said Professor Lupin as they took 
notes. “You notice the lantern dangling from his hand? Hops ahead — people follow the light — then —” 
The hinkypunk made a horrible squelching noise against the 
glass. 
When the bell rang, everyone gathered up their things and 
headed for the door, Ha rry among them, but — 
“Wait a moment, Harry,” Lupin called. “I’d like a word.” 
Harry doubled back and watched Professor Lupin covering the 
hinkypunk’s box with a cloth. 
“I heard about the match,” said Lu pin, turning back to his desk 
and starting to pile books into his briefcase, “and I’m sorry about 
your broomstick. Is there any chance of fixing it?” 
“No,” said Harry. “The tree smashed it to bits.” 
Lupin sighed. 
“They planted the Whomping Wi l l o w t h e s a m e y e a r t h a t I 
arrived at Hogwarts. People used to play a game, trying to get 
near enough to touch the trunk. In the end, a boy called Davey Gudgeon nearly lost an eye, and we were forbidden to go near it. 
No broomstick would have a chance. 
“Did you hear about the dementors too?” said Harry with diffi-
culty. 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 187  Lupin looked at him quickly. 
“Yes, I did. I don’t think any of us have seen Professor Dumble-
dore that angry. They have been growing restless for some time . . . 
furious at his refusal to let them inside the grounds. . . . I suppose 
they were the re ason you fell?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. He hesitated, and then the question he had to 
ask burst from him before he could stop himself. “ Why? Why do 
they affect me like that? Am I just — ?” 
“It has nothing to do with weakness,” said Professor Lupin 
sharply, as though he had read Harry’s mind. “The dementors af-fect you worse than the others because there are horrors in your past that the othe rs don’t have.” 
A ray of wintery sunlight fell ac ross the classroom, illuminating 
Lupin’s gray hairs and the lines on his young face. 
“Dementors are among the foulest cr eatures that walk this earth. 
They infest the darkest, filthiest pl aces, they glory in decay and de-
spair, they drain peace, hope, and happiness out of the air around 
them. Even Muggles feel their pr esence, though they can’t see 
them. Get too near a dementor and every good feeling, every 
happy memory will be sucked out of you. If it can, the dementor 
will feed on you long enough to reduce you to something like it-
self . . . soul-less and evil. You’ll be left with nothing but the worst 
experiences of your life. And the worst that happened to you, 
Harry, is enough to make anyone fall off their broom. You have 
nothing to feel ashamed of.” 
“When they get near me —” Ha rry stared at Lupin’s desk, his 
throat tight. “I can hear Voldemort murdering my mum.” 
Lupin made a sudden motion with his arm as though to grip 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 188  Harry’s shoulder, but thought better of it. There was a moment’s si-
lence, then — 
“Why did they have to come to the match?” said Harry bitterly. 
“They’re getting hungry,” said Lu pin coolly, shutting his briefcase 
with a snap. “Dumbledore won’t let them into the school, so their 
supply of human prey has dried up. . . . I don’t think they could resist 
the large crowd around the Quidditch field. All that excite-
ment . . . emotions runn ing high . . . it was th eir idea of a feast.” 
“Azkaban must be terrible, ” Harry muttered. Lupin nodded 
grimly. 
“The fortress is set on a tiny island, way out to sea, but they don’t 
need walls and water to keep the prisoners in, not when they’re all 
trapped inside their own heads, incapable of a single cheerful 
thought. Most of them go mad within weeks.” 
“But Sirius Black escaped from them,” Harry said slowly. “He 
got away. . . .” 
Lupin’s briefcase slipped from th e desk; he had to stoop quickly 
to catch it. 
“Yes,” he said, straightening up , “Black must have found a way 
to fight them. I wouldn’t have beli eved it possible . . . . Dementors 
are supposed to drain a wizard of his powers if he is left with them too long. . . .” 
“You made that dementor on the tr ain back off,” said Harry sud-
denly. 
“There are — certain defenses o ne can use,” said Lupin. “But 
there was only one dementor on the train. The more there are, the more difficult it be comes to resist.” 
“What defenses?” said Harry at once. “C an you teach me?” 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 189  “I don’t pretend to be an expert at fighting dementors, Harry . . . 
quite the contrary. . . .” 
“But if the dementors come to another Quidditch match, I need 
to be able to fight them —” 
Lupin looked into Harry’s determined face, hesitated, then said, 
“Well . . . all right. I’ll try and help . But it’ll have to wait until next 
term, I’m afraid. I have a lot to do before the holidays. I chose a 
very inconvenient time to fall ill.” 
 
What with the promise of anti-dementor lessons from Lupin, the 
thought that he might never have to hear his mother’s death again, 
and the fact that Ravenclaw flattened Hufflepuff in their Quid-
ditch match at the end of November, Harry’s mood took a definite upturn. Gryffindor were not out of the running after all, although 
they could not afford to lose another match. Wood became repos-
sessed of his manic energy, and worked his team as hard as ever in 
the chilly haze of rain that persisted into December. Harry saw 
no hint of a dementor within the grounds. Dumbledore’s anger 
seemed to be keeping them at th eir stations at the entrances. 
Two weeks before the end of th e term, the sky lightened sud-
denly to a dazzling, opaline whit e and the muddy grounds were re-
vealed one morning covered in glittering frost. Inside the castle, 
there was a buzz of Christmas in the air. Professor Flitwick, the 
Charms teacher, had already deco rated his classroom with shim-
mering lights that turned out to be real, fluttering fairies. The stu-dents were all happily discussing their plans for the holidays. Both 
Ron and Hermione had decided to remain at Hogwarts, and 
though Ron said it was because he couldn’t stand two weeks with 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 190  Percy, and Hermione insisted she needed to use the library, Harry 
wasn’t fooled; they were doing it to keep him company, and he was 
very grateful. 
To everyone’s delight except Ha rry’s, there was to be another 
Hogsmeade trip on the very last weekend of the term. 
“We can do all our Christmas sh opping there!” said Hermione. 
“Mum and Dad would really love those Toothflossing Stringmints 
from Honeydukes!” 
Resigned to the fact that he would be the only third year staying 
behind again, Harry borrowed a copy of Which Broomstick from 
Wood, and decided to spend the day reading up on the different 
makes. He had been riding one of the school brooms at team prac-
tice, an ancient Shooting Star, w hich was very slow and jerky; he 
definitely needed a ne w broom of his own. 
On the Saturday morning of the Hogsmeade trip, Harry bid 
good-bye to Ron and Hermione, wh o were wrapped in cloaks and 
scarves, then turned up the marble staircase alone, and headed back 
toward Gryffindor Tower. Snow had started to fall outside the win-
dows, and the castle was very still and quiet. 
“Psst — Harry!” 
He turned, halfway along the thir d-floor corridor , to see Fred 
and George peering out at him fr om behind a statue of a hump-
backed, one-eyed witch. 
“What are you doing?” said Harry curiously. “How come you’re 
not going to Hogsmeade?” 
“We’ve come to give you a bit of festive cheer before we go,” said 
Fred, with a mysterious wi nk. “Come in here. . . .” 
He nodded toward an empty clas sroom to the left of the one- 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 191  eyed statue. Harry followed Fred and George inside. George closed 
the door quietly and then turned , beaming, to look at Harry. 
“Early Christmas present fo r you, Harry,” he said. 
Fred pulled something from inside his cloak with a flourish and 
laid it on one of the desks. It was a large, square, very worn piece of 
parchment with nothing written on it. Harry, suspecting one of 
Fred and George’s jokes, stared at it. 
“What’s that supposed to be?” “This, Harry, is the secret of our success,” said George, patting 
the parchment fondly. 
“It’ s a wrench, giving it to you,” said Fred, “but we decided last 
night, your need’s greater than ours.” 
“Anyway, we know it by heart,” said George. “We bequeath it to 
you. We don’t really need it anymore.” 
“And what do I need with a bi t of old parchment?” said Harry. 
“A bit of old parchment!” said Fr ed, closing his eyes with a gri-
mace as though Harry had mort ally offended him. “Explain, 
George.” 
“Well . . . when we were in our first year, Harry — young, care-
free, and innocent —” 
Harry snorted. He doubted whether Fred and George had ever 
been innocent. 
“— well, more innocent than we are now — we got into a spot 
of bother with Filch.” 
“We let off a Dungbomb in the corridor and it upset him for 
some reason —” 
“So he hauled us off to his office and started threatening us with 
the usual —” 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 192  “— detention —” 
“— disembowelment —” 
“— and we couldn’t help noticing a drawer in one of his filing 
cabinets marked Confiscated and Highly Dangerous. ” 
“Don’t tell me —” said Harry, starting to grin. 
“Well, what would you’ve done?” said Fred. “George caused a 
diversion by dropping another Dungbomb, I whipped the drawer 
open, and grabbed — this.” 
“It’s not as bad as it sounds, you know,” said George. “We don’t 
reckon Filch ever found out how to work it. He probably suspected 
what it was, though, or he wo uldn’t have confiscated it.” 
“And you know how to work it?” 
“Oh yes,” said Fred, smirking. “T his little beauty’s taught us 
more than all the teachers in this school.” 
“You’re winding me up,” said Harry, looking at the ragged old 
bit of parchment. 
“Oh, are we?” said George. He took out his wand, touched th e parchment lightly, and said, 
“I solemnly swear that I am up to no good. ” 
And at once, thin ink lines began to spread like a spider’s web 
from the point that George’s wand had touched. They joined each 
other, they crisscrossed, they fanned into every corner of the parch-ment; then words began to blosso m across the top, great, curly 
green words, that proclaimed: 
 
Messrs. Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs 
Purveyors of Aids to Magical Mischief-Makers 
are proud to present 
THE MARAUDER ’S MAP 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 193  It was a map showing every detail of the Hogwarts castle and 
grounds. But the truly remarkable thing were the tiny ink dots 
moving around it, each labeled wi th a name in minuscule writing. 
Astounded, Harry bent over it. A la beled dot in the top left corner 
showed that Professor Dumbledore was pacing his study; the care-taker’s cat, Mrs. Norris, was prow ling the second floor; and Peeves 
the Poltergeist was currently bouncing around the trophy room. 
And as Harry’s eyes traveled up and down the familiar corridors, he 
noticed something else. 
This map showed a set of passa ges he had never entered. And 
many of them seemed to lead — 
“Right into Hogsmeade,” said Fred , tracing one of them with his 
finger. “There are seven in all. Now, Filch knows about these 
four” — he pointed them out — “b ut we’re sure we’re the only 
ones who know about these. Don’t bother with the one behind the 
mirror on the fourth floor. We used it until last winter, but it’s 
caved in — completely blocked. An d we don’t reckon anyone’s ever 
used this one, because the Whomping Willow’s planted right over 
the entrance. But this one here, th is one leads righ t into the cellar 
of Honeydukes. We’ve used it loads of times. And as you might’ve 
noticed, the entrance is right outside this room, through that one-
eyed old crone’s hump.” 
“Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs,” sighed George, pat-
ting the heading of the map. “We owe them so much.” 
“Noble men, working tirelessly to help a new generation of law-
breakers,” said Fred solemnly. 
“Right,” said George briskly. “Don’t forget to wipe it after you’ve 
used it —” 
“— or anyone can read it ,” Fred said warningly. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 194  “Just tap it again and say, ‘Mischief managed!’ And it’ll go 
blank.” 
“So, young Harry,” said Fred, in an uncanny impersonation of 
Percy, “mind you behave yourself.” 
“See you in Honeydukes,” said George, winking. 
They left the room, both smirking in a satisfied sort of way. 
Harry stood there, gazing at th e miraculous map. He watched 
the tiny ink Mrs. Norris turn left and pause to sniff at something 
on the floor. If Filch real ly didn’t know . . . he wouldn’t have to pass 
the dementors at all. . . . 
But even as he stood there, fl ooded with excitement, something 
Harry had once heard Mr. Weasley say came floating out of his 
memory. 
Never trust anything that can think for itself, if you can’t see where 
it keeps its brain. 
This map was one of those da ngerous magical objects Mr. 
Weasley had been warning against. . . . Aids for Magical Mischief-
Makers . . . but then, Harry reasoned, he only wanted to use it to 
get into Hogsmeade, it wasn’t as though he wanted to steal any-
thing or attack anyone . . . and Fr ed and George had been using it 
for years without anything horrible happening. . . . 
Harry traced the secret passage to Honeydukes with his finger. Then, quite suddenly, as though following orders, he rolled up 
the map, stuffed it inside his robe s, and hurried to the door of the 
classroom. He opened it a couple of inches. There was no one out-
side. Very carefully, he edged out of the room and behind the statue 
of the one-eyed witch. 
What did he have to do? He pu lled out the map again and saw, 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 195  to his astonishment, that a new ink figure had appeared upon it, la-
beled Harry Potter. This figure was standing exactly where the real 
Harry was standing, about halfwa y down the third-floor corridor. 
Harry watched carefully. His little in k self appeared to be tapping 
the witch with his minute wand. Harry quickly took out his real 
wand and tapped the statue. Nothin g happened. He looked back at 
the map. The tiniest speech bubble ha d appeared next to his figure. 
The word inside said, “ Dissendium. ” 
“Dissendium !” Harry whispered, tapping the stone witch again. 
At once, the statue’s hump opened wide enough to admit a fairly 
thin person. Harry glanced quickly up and down the corridor, then tucked the map away again, hoisted himself into the hole headfirst, 
and pushed himself forward. 
He slid a considerable way down wh at felt like a stone slide, then 
landed on cold, damp earth. He stood up, looking around. It was 
pitch dark. He held up his wand, muttered, “ Lumos !” and saw that 
he was in a very narrow, low, earthy passageway. He raised the map, 
tapped it with the tip of his wand, and muttered, “Mischief man-
aged!” The map went blank at once. He folded it carefully, tucked 
it inside his robes, then, heart be ating fast, both excited and appre-
hensive, he set off. 
The passage twisted and turned, mo re like the burrow of a giant 
rabbit than anything else. Harry hurried along it, stumbling now 
and then on the uneven floor, ho lding his wand out in front of 
him. 
It took ages, but Ha rry had the thought of Honeydukes to sus-
t a i n h i m . A f t e r w h a t f e lt like an hour, the passage began to rise. 
Panting, Harry sped up, his fa ce hot, his feet very cold. 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 196  Ten minutes later, he came to the foot of some worn stone steps, 
which rose out of sight above him. Careful not to make any noise, 
Harry began to climb. A hundred steps, two hundred steps, he lost 
count as he climbed, watching his feet. . . . Then, without warn-
ing, his head hit something hard. 
It seemed to be a trapdoor. Ha rry stood there, massaging the top 
of his head, listening. He couldn’t hear any sounds above him. Very 
slowly, he pushed th e trapdoor open and peered over the edge. 
He was in a cellar, which was fu ll of wooden crates and boxes. 
Harry climbed out of the trapdoor an d replaced it — it blended so 
perfectly with the dusty floor that it was impossible to tell it was 
there. Harry crept slowly toward the wooden staircase that led up-
stairs. Now he could definitely he ar voices, not to mention the tin-
kle of a bell and the openin g and shutting of a door. 
Wondering what he ought to do, he suddenly heard a door open 
much closer at hand; somebody was about to come downstairs. 
“And get another box of Jelly Slugs, dear, they’ve nearly cleaned 
us out —” said a woman’s voice. 
A pair of feet was coming down th e staircase. Harry leapt behind 
an enormous crate and waited for the footsteps to pass. He heard 
the man shifting boxes against the opposite wall. He might not get 
another chance — 
Quickly and silently, Harry dodged out from his hiding place 
and climbed the stairs; looking ba ck, he saw an enormous backside 
and shiny bald head, buried in a box. Harry reached the door at the 
top of the stairs, slipped throug h it, and found himself behind the 
counter of Honeydukes — he duck ed, crept sideways, and then 
straightened up. 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 197  Honeydukes was so crowded with Hogwarts stud ents that no 
one looked twice at Harry. He edged among them, looking 
around, and suppressed a laugh as he imagined the look that would spread over Dudley’s piggy face if he could see where Harry was 
now. 
There were shelves upon shelve s of the most succulent-looking 
sweets imaginable. Creamy chunks of nougat, shimmering pink 
squares of coconut ice, fat, hone y-colored toffees; hundreds of dif-
ferent kinds of chocolate in neat rows; there was a large barrel of Every Flavor Beans, and another of Fizzing Whizbees, the levitat-
ing sherbert balls that Ron ha d mentioned; along yet another 
w a l l w e r e “ S p e c i a l E f f e c t s ” s w e e t s : D r o o b l e ’ s B e s t B l o w i n g G u m (which filled a room with bluebell- colored bubbles that refused to 
pop for days), the strange, splintery Toothflossing Stringmints, tiny black Pepper Imps (“breathe fire for your friends!”), Ice Mice 
(“hear your teeth chatter and squeak!”), peppermint creams shaped like toads (“hop realistically in the stomach!”), fragile sugar-spun 
quills, and exploding bonbons. 
Harry squeezed himself through a crowd of sixth years and saw 
a sign hanging in the farthest corner of the shop ( Unusual Tastes ). 
Ron and Hermione were standing underneath it, examining a tray 
of blood-flavored lollipops. Harry sneaked up behind them. 
“Ugh, no, Harry won’t want one of those, they’re for vampires, I 
expect,” Hermione was saying. 
“How about these?” said Ron, shoving a jar of Cockroach Clus-
ters under Hermione’s nose. 
“Definitely not,” said Harry. 
Ron nearly dropped the jar. 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 198  “Harry !” squealed Hermione. “W hat are you doing here? 
How — how did you — ?” 
“Wow!” said Ron, looking very impressed, “you’ve learned to 
Apparate!” 
“ ’Course I haven’t,” said Harry. He dropped his voice so that 
none of the sixth years could hear him and told them all about the 
Marauder’s Map. 
“ H o w c o m e F r e d a n d G e o r g e n e v e r g a v e i t t o me!” said Ron, 
outraged. “I’m their brother!” 
“But Harry isn’t going to keep it!” said Hermione, as though 
the idea were ludicrous. “He’s go ing to hand it in to Professor 
McGonagall, aren’t you, Harry?” 
“No, I’m not!” said Harry. 
“Are you mad?” said Ron, goggling at Hermione. “Hand in 
something that good?” 
“If I hand it in, I’ll have to sa y where I got it! Filch would know 
Fred and George had nicked it!” 
“But what about Sirius Black?” Hermione hissed. “He could be 
using one of the passages on that map to get into the castle! The 
teachers have got to know!” 
“He can’t be getting in through a passage,” said Harry quickly. 
“There are seven secret tunnels on the map, right? Fred and George 
reckon Filch already knows about four of them. And of the other three — one of them’s caved in, so no one can get through it. One 
of them’s got the Whomping Willow planted over the entrance, so 
you can’t get out of it. And the one I just came through — well — 
it’s really hard to s ee the entrance to it down in the cellar, so unless

Harry hesitated. What if Black di d know the passage was there?

THE MINISTRY OF MAGIC 
Customers are reminded that until further notice, de-
mentors will be patrolling the streets of Hogsmeade 
every night after sundown. This measure has been put 
in place for the safety of Hogsmeade residents and will be lifted upon the recapture of Sirius Black. It is there-fore advisable that you complete your shopping well before nightfall. 
Merry Christmas! 
 
“See?” said Ron quietly. “I’d like to see Black try and break into 
Honeydukes with dementors swarming all over the village. Any-
way, Hermione, the Honeydukes owners would hear a break-in, 
wouldn’t they? They live over the shop!” 
“Yes, but — but —” Hermoine seemed to be struggling to find 
another problem. “Look, Harry still shouldn’t be coming into 
Hogsmeade. He hasn’t got a signed form! If anyone finds out, he’ll 
be i n s o m u c h t r o u b l e ! A n d i t ’ s not nightfall yet — what if Sirius 
Black turns up today? Now?” 
“He’d have a job spotting Harry in this,” said Ron, nodding 
through the mullioned windows at the thick, swirling snow. 
“Come on, Hermione, it’s Christmas. Harry deserves a break.” 
Hermione bit her lip, l ooking extremely worried. 
“Are you going to report me?” Harry asked her, grinning. 
“Oh — of course not — but honestly, Harry —” 
CHAPTER TEN 
 200  “Seen the Fizzing Whiz bees, Harry?” said Ron, grabbing him 
and leading him over to their barr el. “And the Jelly Slugs? And the 
Acid Pops? Fred gave me one of those when I was seven — it burnt 
a hole right through my tongue. I remember Mum walloping him 
with her broomstick.” Ron stared broodingly into the Acid Pop 
box. “Reckon Fred’d take a bit of Cockroach Cluster if I told him 
they were peanuts?” 
When Ron and Hermione had paid fo r all their sweets, the three 
of them left Honeydukes for the blizzard outside. 
Hogsmeade looked like a Christma s card; the little thatched cot-
tages and shops were all covered in a layer of crisp snow; there were 
holly wreaths on the doors and strings of en chanted candles hang-
ing in the trees. 
Harry shivered; unlike the other tw o, he didn’t have his cloak. 
They headed up the street, head s bowed against the wind, Ron and 
Hermione shouting th rough their scarves. 
“That’s the post office —” “Zonko’s is up there —” 
“We could go up to the Shrieking Shack —” 
“Tell you what,” said Ron, his te eth chattering, “shall we go for 
a butterbeer in the Three Broomsticks?” 
Harry was more than willing; th e wind was fierce and his hands 
were freezing, so they crossed the road, and in a few minutes were 
entering the tiny inn. 
It was extremely crowded, noisy, warm, and smoky. A curvy sort 
of woman with a pretty face was serving a bunch of rowdy warlocks up at the bar. 
“That’s Madam Rosmerta,” said Ro n. “I’ll get the drinks, shall 
I?” he added, going slightly red. 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 201  Harry and Hermione made their way to the back of the room, 
where there was a small, vacant table between the window and a 
handsome Christmas tree, which stood next to the fireplace. Ron 
came back five minutes later, ca rrying three foaming tankards of 
hot butterbeer. 
“Merry Christmas!” he said ha ppily, raising his tankard. 
Harry drank deeply. It was the mo st delicious thing he’d ever 
tasted and seemed to heat eve ry bit of him from the inside. 
A sudden breeze ruffled his hair . The door of the Three Broom-
sticks had opened again. Harry look ed over the rim of his tankard 
and choked. 
Professors McGonagall and Flitwick had just entered the pub 
with a flurry of snowflakes, sh ortly followed by Hagrid, who was 
deep in conversation with a portly man in a lime-green bowler hat 
and a pinstriped cloak — Cornelius Fudge, Minister of Magic. 
In an instant, Ron and Hermione had both placed hands on the 
top of Harry’s head and forced him off his stool and under the table. Dripping with butterbeer and crouching out of sight, Harry clutched 
his empty tankard and watched the teachers’ and Fudge’s feet move 
toward the bar, pause, then turn and walk right toward him. 
Somewhere above him, Hermione whispered, “ Mobiliarbus !” 
The Christmas tree beside their table rose a few inches off the 
ground, drifted sideways, and landed with a soft thump right in 
front of their table, hiding them from view. Staring through the dense lower branches, Harry saw four sets of chair legs move back 
from the table right beside theirs , then heard the grunts and sighs 
of the teachers and minister as they sat down. 
Next he saw another pair of feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high 
heels, and heard a woman’s voice. 
CHAPTER TEN 
 202  “A small gillywater —” 
“Mine,” said Professor McGonagall’s voice. 
“Four pints of mu lled mead —” 
“Ta, Rosmerta,” said Hagrid. 
“A cherry syrup and soda with ice and umbrella —” 
“Mmm!” said Professor Flit wick, smacking his lips. 
“So you’ll be the red cu rrant rum, Minister.” 
“Thank you, Rosmerta, m’dear,” said Fudge’s voice. “Lovely to 
see you again, I must say. Have one yourself, won’t you? Come and 
join us. . . .” 
“Well, thank you ve ry much, Minister.” 
Harry watched the glittering heels march away and back again. 
His heart was pounding uncomfortably in his throat. Why hadn’t it 
occurred to him that this was the last weekend of term for the teach-
ers too? And how long were they go ing to sit there? He needed time 
to sneak back into Ho neydukes if he wanted to return to school 
tonight. . . . Hermione’s leg gave a nervous twitch next to him. 
“So, what brings you to this ne ck of the woods, Minister?” came 
Madam Rosmerta’s voice. 
Harry saw the lower part of Fudge’s thick body twist in his chair 
as though he were checking for eavesdroppers. Then he said in a 
quiet voice, “What else, m’dear, but Sirius Black? I daresay you 
heard what happened up at the school at Halloween?” 
“I did hear a rumor,” admitted Madam Rosmerta. “Did you tell the whole pub, Hagrid?” said Professor McGona-
gall exasperatedly. 
“Do you think Black’s still in the area, Minister?” whispered 
Madam Rosmerta. 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 203  “I’m sure of it,” said Fudge shortly. 
“You know that the dementors ha ve searched the whole village 
twice?” said Madam Rosm erta, a slight edge to her voice. “Scared 
all my customers away. . . . It’s very bad for business, Minister.” 
“Rosmerta, m’dear, I don’t like them any more than you do,” said 
Fudge uncomfortably. “Necessary pr ecaution . . . unfortunate, but 
there you are. . . . I’ve just met some of them. Th ey’re in a fury against 
Dumbledore — he won’t let them inside the castle grounds.” 
“I should think not,” said Pro fessor McGonagall sharply. “How 
are we supposed to teach with those horrors floating around?” 
“Hear, hear!” squeaked tiny Pr ofessor Flitwick, whose feet were 
dangling a foot from the ground. 
“All the same,” demurred Fudge, “they are here to protect you all 
from something much worse. . . . We all know what Black’s capa-
ble of. . . .” 
“Do you know, I still have trou ble believing it,” said Madam 
Rosmerta thoughtfully. “Of all the people to go over to the Dark Side, Sirius Black was the last I’d have thought . . . I mean, I re-
member him when he was a boy at Ho gwarts. If you’d told me then 
what he was going to become, I’ d have said you’d had too much 
mead.” 
“You don’t know the half of it, Rosmerta,” said Fudge gruffly. 
“The worst he did isn’t widely known.” 
“The worst?” said Madam Rosmerta , her voice alive with curios-
ity. “Worse than murdering all those poor people, you mean?” 
“I certainly do,” said Fudge. 
“I can’t believe that. What could possibly be worse?” 
“You say you remember him at Hogwarts, Rosmerta,” mur- 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 204  mured Professor McGonagall. “D o you remember who his best 
friend was?” 
“Naturally,” said Madam Rosmerta, with a small laugh. “Never 
saw one without the other, did you? The number of times I had 
them in here — ooh, they used to make me laugh. Quite the dou-
ble act, Sirius Blac k and James Potter!” 
Harry dropped his tankard with a loud clunk. Ron kicked him. 
“Precisely,” said Professor McGonagall. “Black and Potter. Ring-
leaders of their little gang. Both very bright, of course — excep-tionally bright, in fact — but I don’t think we’ve ever had such a 
pair of troublemakers —” 
“I dunno,” chuckled Hagrid. “Fred and George Weasley could 
give ’em a run fer their money.” 
“You’d have thought Black and Pott er were brothers!” chimed in 
Professor Flitwick. “Inseparable!” 
“Of course they were,” said Fudge. “Potter trusted Black beyond 
all his other friends. Nothing chan ged when they left school. Black 
was best man when James married Lily. Then they named him god-
father to Harry. Harry has no idea , of course. You can imagine how 
the idea would torment him.” 
“Because Black turned out to be in league with You-Know-
Who?” whispered Madam Rosmerta. 
“Worse even than that, m’dear. . . .” Fudge dropped his voice and 
proceeded in a sort of low rumble. “Not many people are aware that 
the Potters knew You-Know-Who was after them. Dumbledore, 
who was of course working tirelessly against You-Know-Who, had a 
number of useful spies. One of th em tipped him off, and he alerted 
James and Lily at once. He advised th em to go into hiding. Well, of 
 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 205  course, You-Know-Who wasn ’ t an easy person to hide from. Dumble-
dore told them that their best chance was the Fidelius Charm.” 
“How does that work?” said Madam Rosmerta, breathless with 
interest. Professor Flitwi ck cleared his throat. 
“An immensely complex spell,” he said squeakily, “involving the 
magical concealment of a secret inside a single, living soul. The in-
formation is hidden inside the ch osen person, or Secret-Keeper, 
and is henceforth impossible to find — unless, of course, the 
Secret-Keeper chooses to divulge it . As long as the Secret-Keeper 
refused to speak, You-Know-Who could search the village where 
Lily and James were staying for years and never find them, not even if he had his nose pressed agai nst their sitting room window!” 
“So Black was the Potters’ Secr et-Keeper?” whispered Madam 
Rosmerta. 
“Naturally,” said Professor Mc Gonagall. “James Potter told 
Dumbledore that Black would die rath er than tell where they were, 
that Black was planning to go into hiding himself . . . and yet, 
Dumbledore remained worried. I re member him offering to be the 
Potters’ Secret-Keeper himself.” 
“He suspected Black?” gasped Madam Rosmerta. 
“He was sure that somebody close to the Potters had been keep-
ing You-Know-Who informed of their movements,” said Professor 
McGonagall darkly. “Indeed, he ha d suspected for some time that 
someone on our side had turned tr aitor and was passing a lot of in-
formation to You-Know-Who.” 
“But James Potter insist ed on using Black?” 
“He did,” said Fudge heavily. “And then, barely a week after the 
Fidelius Charm had been performed —” 
CHAPTER TEN 
 206  “Black betrayed them?” breathed Madam Rosmerta. 
“He did indeed. Black was tired of his double-agent role, he was 
ready to declare his support op enly for You-Know-Who, and he 
seems to have planned this for th e moment of the Potters’ death. 
But, as we all know, You-Know-Who met his downfall in little 
Harry Potter. Powers gone, horrib ly weakened, he fled. And this 
left Black in a very nasty position indeed. His master had fallen at 
the very moment when he, Black, had shown his true colors as a 
traitor. He had no choice but to run for it —” 
“Filthy, stinkin’ turnco at!” Hagrid said, so loudly that half the 
bar went quiet. 
“Shh!” said Professor McGonagall. 
“I met him!” growled Hagrid. “I musta bin the last ter see him 
before he killed all them people! It was me what rescued Harry from 
Lily an’ James’s house after they was killed! Jus’ got him outta the 
ruins, poor little thing, with a great slash across his forehead, an’ his 
parents dead . . . an’ Sirius Black turns up, on that flyin’ motorbike 
he used ter ride. Never occurred te r me what he was doin’ there. I 
didn’ know he’d bin Lily an’ James’s Secret-Keeper. Thought he’d 
jus’ heard the news o’ You-Know -Who’s attack an’ come ter see 
what he could do. White an’ shakin’, he was. An’ yeh know what I 
did? I COMFORTED THE MURDERIN’ TRAITOR!” Hagrid 
roared. 
“Hagrid, please!” said Professo r McGonagall. “Keep your voice 
down!” 
“How was I ter know he wasn’ upset abou’ Lily an’ James? It was 
You-Know-Who he cared abou’! An ’ then he says, ‘Give Harry ter 
me, Hagrid, I’m his godfather, I’ll look after him —’ Ha! But I’d 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 207  had me orders from Dumbledore, an’ I told Black no, Dumbledore 
said Harry was ter go ter his aunt an’ uncle’s. Black argued, but in 
the end he gave in. Told me ter take his motorbike ter get Harry 
there. ‘I won’t need it anymore,’ he says. 
“I shoulda known there was some thin’ fishy goin’ on then. He 
loved that motorbike, what was he givin’ it ter me for? Why 
wouldn’ he need it anymore? Fact was, it was too easy ter trace. 
Dumbledore knew he’d bin the Potters’ Secret-Keeper. Black knew he was goin’ ter have ter run fer it that night, knew it was a matter 
o’ hours before the Mi nistry was after him. 
“But what if I’d given Harry to him, eh ? I bet he’d’ve pitched him 
off the bike halfway out ter sea. His bes’ friends’ son! But when a 
wizard goes over ter the Dark Side , there’s nothin’ and no one that 
matters to ’em anymore. . . .” 
A long silence followed Hagrid’s story. Then Madam Rosmerta 
said with some satisfaction, “But he didn’t manage to disappear, 
did he? The Ministry of Magic caught up with him next day!” 
“Alas, if only we had,” said Fudge bitterly. “It was not we who 
found him. It was little Peter Pettigrew — anot her of the Potters’ 
friends. Maddened by grief, no do ubt, and knowing that Black had 
been the Potters’ Secret-Keeper, he went after Black himself.” 
“Pettigrew . . . that fat little boy who was always tagging around 
after them at Hogwarts?” said Madam Rosmerta. 
“Hero-worshipped Black and Pott er,” said Professor McGona-
gall. “Never quite in their league , talent-wise. I was often rather 
sharp with him. You can imagine how I — how I regret that now. . . .” She sounded as thou gh she had a sudden head cold. 
“There, now, Minerva,” said Fudg e kindly, “Pettigrew died a 
 
CHAPTER TEN 
 208  hero’s death. Eyewitnesses — Muggl es, of course, we wiped their 
memories later — told us how Pettigrew cornered Black. They say 
he was sobbing, ‘Lily and James, Sirius! How could you?’ And then he went for his wand. Well, of course, Black was quicker. Blew 
Pettigrew to smit hereens. . . .” 
Professor McGonagall blew her no se and said thickly, “Stupid 
boy . . . foolish boy . . . he was alwa ys hopeless at dueling . . . should 
have left it to th e Ministry. . . .” 
“I tell yeh, if I’d got ter Blac k before little Pettigrew did, I 
wouldn’t’ve messed around with wands — I’d’ve ripped him limb — from — limb,” Hagrid growled. 
“You don’t know what you’re talk ing about, Hagrid,” said Fudge 
sharply. “Nobody but trained Hi t Wizards from the Magical Law 
Enforcement Squad would have st ood a chance against Black once 
he was cornered. I was Junior Mini ster in the Department of Mag-
ical Catastrophes at the time, and I was one of the first on the scene 
after Black murdered all those peop le. I — I will nev er forget it. I 
still dream about it sometimes. A cr ater in the middle of the street, 
so deep it had cracked the sewe r below. Bodies everywhere. Mug-
gles screaming. And Black standing there laughing, with what was 
left of Pettigrew in front of him . . . a heap of bloodstained robes 
and a few — a few fragments —” 
Fudge’s voice stopped abruptly. There was the sound of five 
noses being blown. 
“Well, there you have it, Rosmerta ,” said Fudge thickly. “Black 
was taken away by twenty memb ers of the Magical Law Enforce-
ment Squad and Pettigrew receiv ed the Order of Merlin, First 
Class, which I think was some comf ort to his poor mother. Black’s 
been in Azkaban ever since.” 
THE MARAUDER’S MAP 
 209  Madam Rosmerta let out a long sigh. 
“Is it true he’s mad, Minister?” 
“I wish I could say that he was, ” said Fudge slowly. “I certainly 
believe his master’s defeat unhinged him for a while. The murder of 
Pettigrew and all those Muggles was the action of a cornered and 
desperate man — cruel . . . pointle ss. Yet I met Black on my last 
inspection of Azkaban. You know, most of the prisoners in there 
sit muttering to themselves in the dark; there’s no sense in 
them . . . but I was shocked at how normal Black seemed. He 
spoke quite rationally to me. It was unnerving. You’d have thought he was merely bored — asked if I’d finished with my newspaper, 
cool as you please, said he misse d doing the crossword. Yes, I was 
astounded at how little effect the dementors seemed to be having 
on him — and he was one of the mo st heavily guarded in the place, 
you know. Dementors outsid e his door day and night.” 
“But what do you think he’s broken out to do?” said Madam 
Rosmerta. “Good gracious, Minister, he isn’t trying to rejoin You-
Know-Who, is he?” 
“I daresay that is his — er — eventual plan,” said Fudge eva-
s i v e l y . “ B u t w e h o p e t o c a t c h B l a c k long before that. I must say, 
You-Know-Who alone and friendless is one thing . . . but give him 
back his most devoted servant, an d I shudder to think how quickly 
he’ll rise again. . . .” 
There was a small chink of gl ass on wood. Someone had set 
down their glass. 
“You know, Cornelius, if you’re dining with the headmaster, 
we’d better head back up to the ca stle,” said Professor McGonagall. 
One by one, the pairs of feet in front of Harry took the weight of 
their owners once more; hems of cloaks swung into sight, and 
CHAPTER TEN 
 210  Madam Rosemerta’s glittering h eels disappeared behind the bar. 
The door of the Three Broomstick s opened again, there was an-
other flurry of snow, and the teachers had disappeared. 
“Harry?” 
Ron’s and Hermione’s faces appear ed under the table. They were 
both staring at him, lost for words.

arry didn’t have a very clear idea of how he had managed 
to get back into the Honeydu kes cellar, through the tun-
nel, and into the castle once more. All he knew was that the return 
trip seemed to take no time at al l, and that he hardly noticed what 
he was doing, because his head was still pounding with the conver-
sation he had just heard. 
Why had nobody ever told hi m? Dumbledore, Hagrid, Mr. 
Weasley, Cornelius Fudge . . . wh y hadn’t anyone ever mentioned 
the fact that Harry’s parents had di ed because their best friend had 
betrayed them? 
Ron and Hermione watched Har ry nervously all through din-
ner, not daring to talk about what they’d overheard, because Percy 
was sitting close by them. When th ey went upstairs to the crowded 
common room, it was to find Fred and George had set off half a 
dozen Dungbombs in a fit of end-of- term high spirits. Harry, who 
didn’t want Fred and George asking him whether he’d reached H 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 212  Hogsmeade or not, sneaked quietl y up to the empty dormitory and 
headed straight for his bedside ca binet. He pushed his books aside 
and quickly found what he was looking for — the leather-bound 
photo album Hagrid had given hi m two years ago, which was full 
of wizard pictures of his mother and father. He sat down on his 
bed, drew the hangings around him, and started turning the pages, 
searching, until . . . 
He stopped on a picture of his parents’ wedding day. There was 
his father waving up at him, beam ing, the untidy black hair Harry 
had inherited standing up in all directions. There was his mother, 
alight with happiness, arm in arm with his dad. And there . . . that 
must be him. Their best man . . . Harry had never given him a 
thought before. 
If he hadn’t known it was the same person, he would never have 
guessed it was Black in this old ph otograph. His face wasn’t sunken 
and waxy, but handsome, full of laughter. Had he already been 
working for Voldemort when this pi cture had been taken? Was he 
already planning the de aths of the two people next to him? Did he 
realize he was facing twelve year s in Azkaban, twelve years that 
would make him unrecognizable? 
But the dementors don’t affect him, Harry thought, staring into 
the handsome, laughing face. H e d o e s n ’ t h a v e t o h e a r m y m u m 
screaming if they get too close — 
Harry slammed the album shut, reached over and stuffed it back 
into his cabinet, took off his robe and glasses and got into bed, 
making sure the hangings we re hiding him from view. 
The dormitory door opened. 
“Harry?” said Ron’s voice uncertainly. 
 
THE FIREBOLT 
 213  But Harry lay still, pretending to be asleep. He heard Ron leave 
again, and rolled over on hi s back, his eyes wide open. 
A hatred such as he had never known before was coursing 
through Harry like poison. He co uld see Black laughing at him 
through the darkness, as though somebody had pasted the picture 
from the album over his eyes. He watched, as though somebody 
was playing him a piece of film, Sirius Black blasting Peter Petti-
grew (who resembled Neville Longbottom) into a thousand pieces. 
He could hear (though having no idea what Black’s voice might 
sound like) a low, excited mu tter. “It has happened, My 
Lord . . . the Potters have made me their Secret-Keeper. . . .” And 
then came another voice, laughing shrilly, the same laugh that 
Harry heard inside his head whenever the dementors drew 
near. . . . 
 
“Harry, you — you look terrible.” 
Harry hadn’t gotten to sleep unti l daybreak. He had awoken to 
find the dormitory deserted, dressed, and gone down the spiral stair-
case to a common room that was co mpletely empty except for Ron, 
who was eating a Peppermint Toad and massaging his stomach, and 
Hermione, who had spread her homework over three tables. 
“Where is everyone?” said Harry. 
“Gone! It’s the first day of the holidays, remember?” said Ron, 
watching Harry closely. “It’s nearly lunchtime; I was going to come 
and wake you up in a minute.” 
Harry slumped into a chair next to the fire. Snow was still falling 
outside the windows. Crookshanks was spread out in front of the 
fire like a large, ginger rug. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 214  “You really don’t look well, yo u know,” Hermione said, peering 
anxiously into his face. 
“I’m fine,” said Harry. 
“Harry, listen,” said Hermione, exchanging a look with Ron, 
“you must be really upset about what we heard yesterday. But the 
thing is, you mustn’t go doing anything stupid.” 
“Like what?” said Harry. 
“Like trying to go after Black,” said Ron sharply. 
Harry could tell they had rehearse d this conversation while he 
had been asleep. He didn’t say anything. 
“You won’t, will you, Harry?” said Hermione. “Because Black’s not worth dying for,” said Ron. 
Harry looked at them. They didn’t seem to understand at all. 
“D’you know what I see and hear every time a dementor gets too 
near me?” Ron and Hermione shook their heads, looking appre-
hensive. “I can hear my mum sc reaming and pleading with Volde-
mort. And if you’d heard your mum screaming like that, just about 
to be killed, you wouldn’t forget it in a hurry. And if you found out 
someone who was supposed to be a friend of hers betrayed her and 
sent Voldemort after her —” 
“There’s nothing you can do!” said Hermione, looking stricken. 
“The dementors will catch Black and he’ll go back to Azkaban and — and serve him right!” 
“You heard what Fudge said. Black isn’t affected by Azkaban like 
normal people are. It’s not a punishment for him like it is for the others.” 
“So what are you saying?” said Ron, looking very tense. “You 
want to — to kill Black or something?” 
THE FIREBOLT 
 215  “Don’t be silly,” said Hermione in a panicky voice. “Harry 
doesn’t want to kill anyone, do you, Harry?” 
Again, Harry didn’t answer. He di dn’t know what he wanted to 
do. All he knew was that the idea of doing nothing, while Black 
was at liberty, wa s almost more than he could stand. 
“Malfoy knows,” he said abruptly. “Remember what he said to 
me in Potions? ‘If it was me, I’ d hunt him down myself. . . . I’d 
want revenge.’ ” 
“You’re going to take Malfoy’s ad vice instead of ours?” said Ron 
furiously. “Listen . . . you know what Pettigrew’s mother got back 
after Black had finished with him? Dad told me — the Order of 
Merlin, First Class, and Pettigrew’s finger in a box. That was the 
biggest bit of him they could fi nd. Black’s a madman, Harry, and 
he’s dangerous —” 
“Malfoy’s dad must have told hi m,” said Harry, ignoring Ron. 
“He was right in Voldem ort’s inner circle —” 
“Say You-Know-Who, will you ?” interjected Ron angrily. 
“— so obviously, the Malfoy s knew Black was working for 
Voldemort —” 
“— and Malfoy’d love to see you blown into about a million 
pieces, like Pettigrew! Get a grip. Malfoy’s just hoping you’ll get yourself killed before he has to play you at Quidditch.” 
“Harry, please,” said Hermione, her eyes now shining with tears, 
“please be sensible. Black did a terribl e, terrible thing, but d-don’t 
put yourself in danger, it’s what Black wants. . . . Oh, Harry, you’d 
be playing right into Black’s hands if you went looking for him. Your mum and dad wouldn’t want you to get hurt, would they? 
They’d never want you to go looking for Black!” 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 216  “I’ll never know what they’d have wanted, because thanks to 
Black, I’ve never spoken to them,” said Harry shortly. 
There was a silence in which Crook shanks stretched luxuriously, 
flexing his claws. Ron’s pocket quivered. 
“Look,” said Ron, obviously cast ing around for a change of sub-
ject, “it’s the holidays! It’s nearly Christmas! Let’s — let’s go down 
and see Hagrid. We haven’ t visited him for ages!” 
“No!” said Hermione quickly. “H arry isn’t supposed to leave the 
castle, Ron —” 
“Yeah, let’s go,” said Harry, sitti ng up, “and I can ask him how come 
he never mentioned Black when he told me all about my parents!” 
Further discussion of Sirius Bl ack plainly wasn’t what Ron had 
had in mind. 
“Or we could have a game of chess,” he said hastily, “or Gob-
stones. Percy left a set —” 
“No, let’s visit Hagrid ,” said Harry firmly. 
So they got their cloaks from their dormitories and set off 
through the portrait hole (“Stan d and fight, you yellow-bellied 
mongrels!”), down through the empty castle and out through the 
oak front doors. 
They made their way slowly down the lawn, making a shallow 
trench in the glittering, powdery snow, their socks and the hems of 
their cloaks soaked and freezing. The Forbidden Forest looked as 
though it had been enchanted, each tree smattered with silver, and 
Hagrid’s cabin looked like an iced cake. 
Ron knocked, but there was no answer. 
“He’s not out, is he?” said Hermione, who was shivering under 
her cloak. 
Ron had his ear to the door. 
THE FIREBOLT 
 217  “There’s a weird noise,” he sa id. “Listen — is that Fang?” 
Harry and Hermione put their ears to the door too. From inside 
the cabin came a series of low, throbbing moans. 
“Think we’d better go and get someone?” said Ron nervously. 
“Hagrid!” called Harry, thumping the door. “Hagrid, are you in 
there?” 
There was a sound of heavy foot steps, then the door creaked 
open. Hagrid stood there with his eyes red and swollen, tears 
splashing down the fron t of his leather vest. 
“Yeh’ve heard?” he bellowed, and he flung himself onto Harry’s 
neck. 
Hagrid being at least twice the size of a normal man, this was no 
laughing matter. Harry, about to collapse under Hagrid’s weight, was rescued by Ron and Hermione, who each seized Hagrid under 
an arm and heaved him back into the cabin. Hagrid allowed him-
self to be steered into a chair an d slumped over the table, sobbing 
uncontrollably, his face glazed wi th tears that dr ipped down into 
his tangled beard. 
“Hagrid, what is it?” said Hermione, aghast. 
Harry spotted an official-looking letter lying open on the table. 
“What’s this, Hagrid?” 
Hagrid’s sobs redoubled, but he shoved the letter toward Harry, 
who picked it up and read aloud: 
 
Dear Mr. Hagrid, 
Further to our inquiry into the attack by a hippogriff on a 
student in your class, we have accepted the assurances of 
Professor Dumbledore that you bear no responsibility for the 
regrettable incident. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 218  “Wel l, t hat ’ s o kay the n , Hagr id !” s aid Ro n, c l appin g H ag rid o n 
the shoulder. But Hagrid continue d to sob, and waved one of his 
gigantic hands, inviting Harry to read on. 
 
However, we must register our concern about the hippogriff 
in question. We have decided to uphold the official complaint 
of Mr. Lucius Malfoy, and this matter will therefore be taken to the Committee for the Dispos al of Dangerous Creatures. 
The hearing will take place on April 20th, and we ask you to present yourself and your hippogriff at the Committee ’s offices 
in London on that date. In the meantime, the hippogriff should be kept tethered and isolated. 
Yours in fellowship . . . 
 
There followed a list of the school governors. 
“Oh,” said Ron. “But you said Buckbeak isn’t a bad hippogriff, 
Hagrid. I bet he’ll get off—” 
“Yeh don’ know them gargoyles at the Committee fer the Dis-
posal o’ Dangerous Creatures!” chok ed Hagrid, wiping his eyes on 
his sleeve. “They’ve got it in fer interestin’ creatures!” 
A sudden sound from the corner of Hagrid’s cabin made Harry, 
Ron, and Hermione whip around. Buckbeak the hippogriff was lying in the corner, chomping on something that was oozing blood all over the floor. 
“I couldn’ leave him tied up out there in the snow!” choked 
Hagrid. “All on his own! At Christmas.” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one another. They had 
never seen eye to eye with Hagrid ab out what he called “interesting 
creatures” and other people called “terrifying monsters.” On 
THE FIREBOLT 
 219  the other hand, there didn’t seem to be any particular harm in Buck-
beak. In fact, by Hagrid’s usual standards, he was positively cute. 
“You’ll have to put up a good st rong defense, Hagrid,” said 
Hermione, sitting down and laying a hand on Hagrid’s massive 
forearm. “I’m sure you can prove Buckbeak is safe.” 
“Won’t make no diff’rence!” so bbed Hagrid. “Them Disposal 
devils, they’re all in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket! Scared o’ him! An’ if I lose the case, Buckbeak —” 
Hagrid drew his finger swiftly across his throat, then gave a great 
wail and lurched forward, his face in his arms. 
“What about Dumbledore, Hagrid?” said Harry. 
“He’s done more’n enough fer me already,” groaned Hagrid. 
“Got enough on his plate what with keepin’ them dementors outta 
the castle, an’ Sirius Black lurkin’ around —” 
Ron and Hermione look ed quickly at Harry, as though expect-
ing him to start berating Hagrid for not telling him the truth about 
Black. But Harry couldn’t bring him self to do it, not now that he 
saw Hagrid so mise rable and scared. 
“Listen, Hagrid,” he said, “you can’t give up. Hermione’s right, 
you just need a good defense. You can call us as witnesses —” 
“I’m sure I’ve read about a case of hippogriff-baiting,” said 
Hermione thoughtfully, “where the hippogriff got off. I’ll look it 
up for you, Hagrid, and see exactly what happened.” 
Hagrid howled still more loudly. Harry and Hermione looked at 
Ron to help them. 
“Er — shall I make a cu p of tea?” said Ron. 
Harry stared at him. “It’s what my mum does whenever someone’s upset,” Ron mut-
tered, shrugging. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 220  At last, after many more assurances of help, with a steaming mug 
of tea in front of him, Hagrid blew his nose on a handkerchief the 
size of a tablecloth and said, “Yer ri ght. I can’ afford to go ter pieces. 
Gotta pull meself together. . . .” 
Fang the boarhound came timidl y out from under the table and 
laid his head on Hagrid’s knee. 
“I’ve not bin meself lately,” said Hagrid, stroking Fang with one 
hand and mopping his face with the other. “Worried abou’ Buck-
beak, an’ no one liki n’ me classes —” 
“We do like them!” lied Hermione at once. 
“Yeah, they’re great!” said Ron, crossing his fingers under the 
table. “Er — how are the flobberworms?” 
“Dead,” said Hagrid gloom ily. “Too much lettuce.” 
“Oh no!” said Ron, his lip twitching. 
“An’ them dementors make me f eel ruddy terrible an’ all,” said 
Hagrid, with a sudden shudder. “Gotta walk past ’em ev’ry time I 
want a drink in the Three Broomsticks. ’S like bein’ back in 
Azkaban —” 
He fell silent, gulping his te a. Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
watched him breathlessly. They ha d never heard Hagrid talk about 
his brief spell in Azkaban before . After a pause, Hermione said 
timidly, “Is it awful in there, Hagrid?” 
“Yeh’ve no idea,” said Hagrid quietly. “Never bin anywhere like 
it. Thought I was goin’ mad. Kep’ goin’ over horrible stuff in me 
mind . . . the day I got expelled from Hogwarts . . . day me dad 
died . . . day I had ter let Norbert go. . . .” 
His eyes filled with tears. Norbert was the baby dragon Hagrid 
had once won in a game of cards. 
 
THE FIREBOLT 
 221  “Yeh can’ really remember who ye h are after a while. An’ yeh can’ 
see the point o’ livin’ at all. I used ter hope I’d jus’ die in me 
sleep. . . . When they let me out, it was like bein’ born again, ev’ry-
thin’ came floodin’ back, it was the bes’ feelin’ in the world. Mind, 
the dementors weren’t keen on lettin’ me go.” 
“But you were innoce nt!” said Hermione. 
Hagrid snorted. “Think that matters to them? They don’ ca re. Long as they’ve 
got a couple o’ hundred humans st uck there with ’em, so they can 
leech all the happiness out of ’em, they don’ give a damn who’s 
guilty an’ who’s not.” 
Hagrid went quiet for a moment, staring into his tea. Then he 
s a i d q u i e t l y , “ T h o u g h t o ’ j u s ’ l e t t i n g B u c k b e a k g o . . . t r y i n ’ t e r make him fly away . . . but how d’ yeh explain ter a hippogriff it’s 
gotta go inter hidin’? An’ — an ’ I’m scared o’ breakin’ the 
law. . . .” He looked up at them , tears leaking down his face again. 
“I don’ ever want ter go back ter Azkaban.” 
The trip to Hagrid’s, though fa r from fun, had nevertheless had 
the effect Ron and Hermione had hoped. Though Harry had by no 
means forgotten about Black, he couldn’t brood constantly on re-
venge if he wanted to help Hagr id win his case against the Com-
mittee for the Disposal of Dang erous Creatures. He, Ron, and 
Hermione went to the library th e next day and returned to the 
empty common room laden with b ooks that might help prepare a 
defense for Buckbeak. The three of them sat in front of the roaring 
fire, slowly turning the pages of dusty volumes about famous cases 
of marauding beasts, speaking oc casionally when they ran across 
something relevant. 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 222  “Here’s something . . . there was a case in 1722 . . . but the hip-
pogriff was convicted — ugh, look what they did to it, that’s dis-
gusting —” 
“This might help, look — a manticore savaged someone in 
1296, and they let the manticore off — oh — no, that was only 
because everyone was too scar ed to go near it. . . .” 
Meanwhile, in the rest of the castle, the usual magnificent 
Christmas decorations had been put up , despite the fact that hardly 
any of the students remained to enjoy them. Thick streamers of 
holly and mistletoe were strung along the corridors, mysterious 
lights shone from inside every suit of armor, and the Great Hall was 
filled with its usual twelve Christ mas trees, glittering with golden 
stars. A powerful and delicious sm ell of cooking pervaded the cor-
ridors, and by Christmas Eve, it had grown so strong that even 
Scabbers poked his nose out of the shelter of Ron’s pocket to sniff 
hopefully at the air. 
On Christmas morning, Harry wa s woken by Ron throwing his 
pillow at him. 
“Oy! Presents!” 
Harry reached for his glasses and put them on, squinting 
through the semi-darknes s to the foot of his bed, where a small 
heap of parcels had appeared. Ro n was already ripping the paper 
off his own presents. 
“Another sweater from Mum . . . maroon again . . . see if you’ve 
got one.” 
Harry had. Mrs. Weasley had sent him a scarlet sweater with the 
Gryffindor lion knitted on the front, also a dozen home-baked 
mince pies, some Christmas cake, an d a box of nut br ittle. As he 
 
THE FIREBOLT 
 223  moved all these things aside, he saw a long, thin package lying un-
derneath. 
“What’s that?” said Ron, looking over, a freshly unwrapped pair 
of maroon socks in his hand. 
“Dunno . . .” 
Harry ripped the parcel open an d gasped as a magnificent, 
gleaming broomstick rolled out on to his bedspread. Ron dropped 
his socks and jumped off hi s bed for a closer look. 
“I don’t believe it,” he said hoarsely. 
It was a Firebolt, identical to the dream broom Harry had gone 
to see every day in Diagon Alley. It s handle glittered as he picked it 
up. He could feel it vibrating and let go; it hung in midair, unsup-ported, at exactly the right height for him to mount it. His eyes 
moved from the golden registration number at the top of the han-
dle, right down to the perfectly smooth, streamlined birch twigs 
that made up the tail. 
“Who sent it to you?” said Ron in a hushed voice. 
“Look and see if there’s a card,” said Harry. 
Ron ripped apart the Firebolt’s wrappings. 
“Nothing! Blimey, who’d sp end that much on you?” 
“Well,” said Harry, feeling stunned, “I’m betting it wasn’t the 
Dursleys.” 
“I bet it was Dumbledore,” said Ron, now walking around and 
around the Firebolt, taking in every glorious inch. “He sent you the 
Invisibility Cloak anonymously. . . .” 
“That was my dad’s, though,” sa id Harry. “Dumbledore was just 
p a s s i n g i t o n t o m e . H e w o u l d n ’ t spend hundreds of Galleons on 
me. He can’t go giving students stuff like this —” 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 224  “That’s why he wouldn’t say it wa s from him!” said Ron. “In case 
some git like Malfoy said it was favoritism. Hey, Harry” — Ron gave 
a great whoop of laughter — “ Malfoy ! Wait till he sees you on this! 
He’ll be sick as a pig! This is an international standard broom, this is!” 
“I can’t believe this,” Harry muttered, running a hand along the 
Firebolt, while Ron sank onto Harry’ s bed, laughing his head off at 
the thought of Malfoy. “ Who — ?” 
“I know,” said Ron, controlling hi mself, “I know who it could’ve 
been — Lupin!” 
“What?” said Harry, now star ting to laugh himself. “ Lupin ? Lis-
ten, if he had this much gold, he’d be able to buy himself some new 
robes.” 
“Yeah, but he likes you,” said Ro n. “And he was away when your 
Nimbus got smashed, and he migh t’ve heard about it and decided 
to visit Diagon Alley and get this for you —” 
“What d’you mean, he was away?” said Harry. “He was ill when 
I was playing in that match.” 
“Well, he wasn’t in the hospital wing,” said Ron. “I was there, 
cleaning out the bedpans on that detention from Snape, re-
member?” 
Harry frowned at Ron. 
“I can’t see Lupin affording something like this.” 
“What’re you two laughing about?” 
Hermione had just come in, wearing her dressing gown and car-
rying Crookshanks, who was looking very grumpy, with a string of 
tinsel tied around his neck. 
“Don’t bring him in here!” said Ron, hurriedly snatching Scabbers 
from the depths of his bed and stowing him in his pajama pocket. 
 
THE FIREBOLT 
 225  But Hermione wasn’t listening. She dropped Crookshanks onto 
Seamus’s empty bed and stared, open-mouthed, at the Firebolt. 
“Oh, Harry ! Who sent you that?” 
“No idea,” said Harry. “There wasn’t a card or anything with it.” 
To his great surprise, Hermione di d not appear either excited or 
intrigued by the news. On the cont rary, her face fe ll, and she bit 
her lip. 
“What’s the matter with you?” said Ron. 
“I don’t know,” said Hermione slowly, “but it’s a bit odd, isn’t it? 
I mean, this is supposed to be quite a good broom, isn’t it?” 
Ron sighed exasperatedly. “It’s the best broom there is, Hermione,” he said. 
“So it must’ve been real ly expensive. . . .” 
“Probably cost more than all the Slytherins’ brooms put to-
gether,” said Ron happily. 
“Well . . . who’d send Harry somet hing as expensive as that, and 
not even tell him they’d sent it?” said Hermione. 
“Who cares?” said Ron impatientl y. “Listen, Harry, can I have a 
go on it? Can I?” 
“I don’t think anyone should ride that broom just yet!” said 
Hermione shrilly. 
Harry and Ron looked at her. “What d’you think Harry’s going to do with it — sweep the 
floor?” said Ron. 
But before Hermione could answer, Crookshanks sprang from 
Seamus’s bed, right at Ron’s chest. 
“GET — HIM — OUT — OF — HERE!” Ron bellowed as 
Crookshanks’s claws ripped his pajamas and Scabbers attempted a 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 226  wild escape over his shoulder. Ron seized Scabbers by the tail and 
aimed a misjudged kick at Crooks hanks that hit the trunk at the 
end of Harry’s bed, kn ocking it over and causing Ron to hop up 
and down, howling with pain. 
Crookshanks’s fur suddenly stood on end. A shrill, tinny 
whistling was filling the room. The Pocket Sneakoscope had be-
come dislodged from Uncle Vernon ’s old socks and was whirling 
and gleaming on the floor. 
“I forgot about that!” Harry sa id, bending down and picking up 
the Sneakoscope. “I never wear those socks if I can help it. . . .” 
The Sneakoscope whirled and wh istled in his palm. Crook-
shanks was hissing and spitting at it. 
“You’d better take that cat out of here, Hermione,” said Ron fu-
riously, sitting on Harr y’s bed nursing his toe. “Can’t you shut that 
thing up?” he added to Harry as Hermione strode out of the room, Crookshanks’s yellow eyes still fixed maliciously on Ron. 
Harry stuffed the Sneakoscope ba ck inside the socks and threw 
it back into his trunk. All that could be heard now were Ron’s sti-
fled moans of pain and rage. Scabbers was huddled in Ron’s hands. 
It had been a while since Harry ha d seen him out of Ron’s pocket, 
and he was unpleasantly surprised to see that Scabbers, once so fat, 
was now very skinny; patches of fur seemed to have fallen out too. 
“He’s not looking too good, is he?” Harry said. 
“It’s stress!” said Ron. “He’d be fi ne if that big stupid furball left 
him alone!” 
But Harry, remembering what the woman at the Magical 
Menagerie had said about rats living only three years, couldn’t help feeling that unless Scabbers had powers he had never revealed, he 
was reaching the end of his life . And despite Ron’s frequent com-
THE FIREBOLT 
 227  plaints that Scabbers was both boring and useless, he was sure Ron 
would be very miserable if Scabbers died. 
Christmas spirit was definitely thin on the ground in the 
Gryffindor common room that morning. Hermione had shut 
Crookshanks in her dormitory, but was furious with Ron for trying 
to kick him; Ron was still fuming about Crookshanks’s fresh at-
tempt to eat Scabbers. Harry gave up trying to make them talk to 
each other and devoted himself to examining the Firebolt, which he had brought down to the commo n room with him. For some 
reason this seemed to annoy Herm ione as well; she didn’t say any-
thing, but she kept lo oking darkly at the br oom as though it too 
had been criticizing her cat. 
At lunchtime they went down to the Great Hall, to find that the 
House tables had been moved against the walls again, and that a sin-
gle table, set for twelve, stood in the middle of the room. Professors 
Dumbledore, McGonagall, Snape, Sprout, and Flitwick were there, along with Filch, the caretaker, who had taken off his usual brown 
coat and was wearing a very old an d rather moldy-looking tailcoat. 
There were only three other stud ents, two extremely nervous-looking 
first years and a sullen-faced Slytherin fifth year. 
“Merry Christmas!” said Dumb ledore as Harry, Ron, and 
Hermione approached th e table. “As there are so few of us, it 
seemed foolish to use the House ta bles. . . . Sit down, sit down!” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat down side by side at the end of 
the table. 
“Crackers!” said Dumbledore en thusiastically, offering the end 
of a large silver noisemaker to Sn ape, who took it reluctantly and 
tugged. With a bang like a gunshot, the cracker flew apart to reveal 
a large, pointed witch’s hat to pped with a stuffed vulture. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 228  Harry, remembering the boggart , caught Ron’s eye and they 
both grinned; Snape’s mouth th inned and he pushed the hat 
toward Dumbledore, who swapped it for his wizard’s hat at once. 
“Dig in!” he advised th e table, beaming around. 
As Harry was helping himself to roast pota toes, the doors of the 
Great Hall opened again. It was Professor Trelawney, gliding 
toward them as though on wheels. She had put on a green sequined 
dress in honor of the oc casion, making her look more than ever like 
a glittering, over sized dragonfly. 
“Sibyll, this is a pleasant surp rise!” said Dumbledore, standing 
up. 
“I have been crystal gazing, Headmaster,” said Professor Trelawney 
in her mistiest, most faraway voice, “and to my astonishment, I saw myself abandoning my solitary luncheon and coming to join you. 
Who am I to refuse the promptings of fate? I at once hastened from 
my tower, and I do beg you to forgive my lateness. . . .” 
“Certainly, certainly,” said Dumble dore, his eyes twinkling. “Let 
me draw you up a chair —” 
And he did indeed draw a chair in midair with his wand, which 
revolved for a few seco nds before falling wi th a thud between Pro-
fessors Snape and McGonagall. Professor Trelawney, however, did not sit down; her enormous eyes ha d been roving around the table, 
and she suddenly uttered a kind of soft scream. 
“I dare not, Headmaster! If I join the table, we shall be thirteen! 
Nothing could be more unlucky! Never forget that when thirteen 
dine together, the first to rise will be the first to die!” 
“We’ll risk it, Sibyll,” said Pr ofessor McGonagall impatiently. 
“Do sit down, the turkey’s getting stone cold.” 
Professor Trelawney hesitated, then lowered herself into the 
THE FIREBOLT 
 229  empty chair, eyes shut and mouth clenched tight, as though ex-
pecting a thunderbolt to hit th e table. Professor McGonagall 
poked a large spoon into the nearest tureen. 
“Tripe, Sibyll?” Professor Trelawney ignored her. Eyes open again, she looked 
around once more and said, “But where is dear Professor Lupin?” 
“I’m afraid the poor fellow is ill again,” said Dumbledore, indi-
cating that everybody should st art serving themselves. “Most un-
fortunate that it should happen on Christmas Day.” 
“But surely you already knew that, Sibyll?” said Professor 
McGonagall, her eyebrows raised. 
Professor Trelawney gave Professo r McGonagall a very cold look. 
“Certainly I knew, Minerva,” she sa id quietly. “But one does not 
parade the fact that one is All-Kn owing. I frequently act as though 
I am not possessed of the Inner Eye, so as not to make others ner-
vous.” 
“That explains a great deal,” sa id Professor McGonagall tartly. 
Professor Trelawney’s voice sudd enly became a g ood deal less 
misty. 
“If you must know, Minerva, I have seen that poor Professor 
Lupin will not be with us for very long. He seems aware, himself, that his time is short. He positively fled when I offered to crystal 
gaze for him —” 
“Imagine that,” said Pro fessor McGonagall dryly. 
“I doubt,” said Dumbledore, in a cheerful but slightly raised 
voice, which put an end to Prof essor McGonagall and Professor 
Trelawney’s conversation, “that Pr ofessor Lupin is in any immedi-
ate danger. Severus, you’ve ma de the potion for him again?” 
“Yes, Headmaster,” said Snape. 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 230  “Good,” said Dumbledore. “Then he should be up and about in 
no time. . . . Derek, have you had any of these chipolatas? They’re 
excellent.” 
The first-year boy went furiously red on being addressed directly 
by Dumbledore, and took the plat ter of sausages with trembling 
hands. 
Professor Trelawney behaved almost normally until the very end 
of Christmas dinner, two hours later. Full to bursting with Christ-mas dinner and still wearing thei r party hats, Harry and Ron got 
up first from the table and she shrieked loudly. 
“My dears! Which of you left his seat first? Which?” 
“Dunno,” said Ron, looking uneasily at Harry. 
“I doubt it will make much di fference,” said Professor McGona-
gall coldly, “unless a mad axe-man is waitin g outside the doors to 
slaughter the first into the entrance hall.” 
Even Ron laughed. Professor Trel awney looked highly affronted. 
“Coming?” Harry said to Hermione. “No,” Hermione muttered, “I want a quick word with Professor 
McGonagall.” 
“Probably trying to see if she can take any more classes,” yawned 
Ron as they made their way into the entrance hall, which was com-
pletely devoid of mad axe-men. 
When they reached the portrait hole, they found Sir Cadogan 
enjoying a Christmas party with a couple of monks, several previ-
ous headmasters of Hogwarts, and his fat pony. He pushed up his visor and toasted them wi th a flagon of mead. 
“Merry — hic — Christ mas! Password?” 
“Scurvy cur,” said Ron. 
 
THE FIREBOLT 
 231  “And the same to you, sir!” roared Sir Cadogan as the painting 
swung forward to admit them. 
Harry went straight up to the dor mitory, collected the Firebolt 
and the Broomstick Servicing Kit Hermione had given him for his 
birthday, brought them downstairs, and tried to find something to 
do to the Firebolt; however, there were no bent twigs to clip, and 
the handle was so shiny already it seemed pointless to polish it. He 
and Ron simply sat admiring it from every angle until the portrait hole opened, and Hermione came in, accompanied by Professor 
McGonagall. 
Though Professor McGonagall was head of Gryffindor House, 
Harry had seen her in the commo n room only once before, and 
that had been to make a very grave announcement. He and Ron 
stared at her, both holding the Firebolt. Hermione walked around 
them, sat down, picked up the nearest book, and hid her face be-
hind it. 
“So that’s it, is it?” said Professor McGonagall beadily, walking 
over to the fireside and staring at the Firebolt. “Miss Granger has 
just informed me that you have been sent a broomstick, Potter.” 
Harry and Ron looked around at Hermione. They could see her 
forehead reddening over the top of her book, which was upside down. 
“May I?” said Professor McGonaga ll, but she didn’t wait for an 
answer before pulling the Firebolt out of their hands. She exam-ined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. “Hmm. And there was 
no note at all, Potter? No ca rd? No message of any kind?” 
“No,” said Harry blankly. “I see . . . ,” said Professor McGo nagall. “Well, I’m afraid I will 
have to take this, Potter.” 
 
CHAPTER ELEVEN 
 232  “W — what?” said Harry, scra mbling to his feet. “Why?” 
“It will need to be checked for ji nxes,” said Professor McGona-
gall. “Of course, I’m no expert , but I daresay Madam Hooch and 
Professor Flitwick will strip it down —” 
“Strip it down?” repeated Ron, as though Professor McGonagall 
was mad. 
“It shouldn’t take more than a few weeks,” said Professor Mc-
Gonagall. “You will have it back if we are su re it is jinx-free.” 
“There’s nothing wrong with it!” said Harry, his voice shaking 
slightly. “Honestly, Professor —” 
“You can’t know that, Potter,” sa id Professor McGonagall, quite 
kindly, “not until you’ve flown it, at any rate, and I’m afraid that is 
out of the question until we are certain that it has not been tam-
pered with. I shall ke ep you informed.” 
Professor McGonagall turned on her heel and carried the Fire-
bolt out of the portrait hole, wh ich closed behind her. Harry stood 
staring after her, the tin of High-Finish Polish still clutched in his hands. Ron, however, rounded on Hermione. 
“What did you go running to McGonagall for ?” 
Hermione threw her book aside. She was still pink in the face, 
but stood up and face d Ron defiantly. 
“Because I thought — and Profe ssor McGonagall agrees with 
me — that that broom wa s probably sent to Ha rry by Sirius Black!”

 233  THE PATRONUS 
 
 
 
arry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn’t 
stop him from being angry wi th her. He had been the 
owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and 
now, because of her interference, he didn’t know whether he would 
ever see it again. He was positi ve that there was nothing wrong 
with the Firebolt now, but what sort of state would it be in once it had been subjected to all sorts of anti-jinx tests? 
Ron was furious with He rmione too. As far as he was concerned, 
the stripping-down of a brand-new Firebolt was noth ing less than 
criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she 
had acted for the best, started av oiding the comm on room. Harry 
and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn’t try 
to persuade her to come back. All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shor tly after New Year, and Gryffindor 
Tower became crowde d and noisy again.

CHAPTER TWELVE 
 234  Wood sought Harry out on the night before term started. 
“Had a good Christmas?” he said , and then, without waiting for 
an answer, he sat down, lowered hi s voice, and said , “I’ve been do-
ing some thinking over Christmas, Harry. After the last match, you 
know. If the dementors come to the next one . . . I mean . . . we 
can’t afford you to — well —” 
Wood broke off, looking awkward. 
“I’m working on it,” said Harry quickly. “Professor Lupin said 
he’d train me to ward off the dement ors. We should be starting this 
week. He said he’d have time after Christmas.” 
“Ah,” said Wood, his expression clearing. “Well, in that case 
— I really didn’t want to lose you as Seeker, Harry. And have you ordered a new broom yet?” 
“No,” said Harry. “What! You’d better get a move on, you know — you can’t ride 
that Shooting Star against Ravenclaw!” 
“He got a Firebolt for Christmas,” said Ron. “A Firebolt ? No! Seriously? A — a real Firebolt ?” 
“Don’t get excited, Oliver,” said Harry gloomily. “I haven’t got it 
anymore. It was confiscated.” And he explained all about how the 
Firebolt was now being checked for jinxes. 
“Jinxed? How could it be jinxed?” 
“Sirius Black,” Harry said wearily. “He’s supposed to be after me. 
So McGonagall reckons he might have sent it.” 
Waving aside the information that a famous murderer was after 
his Seeker, Wood said, “But Black co uldn’t have bought a Firebolt! 
He’s on the run! The whole country’s on the lookout for him! How 
c o u l d h e j u s t w a l k i n t o Q u a l ity Quidditch Supplies and buy a 
broomstick?” 
THE PATRONUS 
 235  “I know,” said Harry, “but McGo nagall still wants to strip it 
down —” 
Wood went pale. 
“I’ll go and talk to her, Harry,” he promised. “I’ll make her see 
reason. . . . A Firebolt . . . a real Fi rebolt, on our team . . . She wants 
Gryffindor to win as much as we do. . . . I’ll make her see sense. A Firebolt . . .” 
 
Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like do-
ing was spending two hours on th e grounds on a raw January morn-
ing, but Hagrid had provided a bonfi re full of salamanders for their 
enjoyment, and they spent an unus ually good lesson collecting dry 
wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving 
lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The 
first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor 
Trelawney was now teaching them palm istry, and she lost no time in 
informing Harry that he had the shor test life line sh e had ever seen. 
It was Defense Against the Dark Arts that Harry was keen to get 
to; after his conversation with W ood, he wanted to get started on 
his anti-dementor lessons as soon as possible. 
“Ah yes,” said Lupin, when Harry reminded him of his promise 
at the end of class. “Let me se e . . . how about eight o’clock on 
Thursday evening? The History of Magic classroom should be 
large enough. . . . I’ll have to t hink carefully about how we’re going 
to do this. . . . We can’t bring a real dementor into the castle to 
practice on. . . .” 
“Still looks ill, doesn’t he?” said Ron as they walked down the cor-
ridor, heading to dinner. “What d’yo u reckon’s the matter with him?” 
There was a loud and impatient “tuh” from behind them. It was 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 236  Hermione, who had been sitting at the feet of a suit of armor, 
repacking her bag, which was so full of books it wouldn’t close. 
“And what are you tutting at us for?” said Ron irritably. 
“Nothing,” said Hermione in a lo fty voice, heaving her bag back 
over her shoulder. 
“Yes, you were,” said Ron. “I sa id I wonder what’s wrong with 
Lupin, and you —” 
“Well, isn’t it obvious ?” said Hermione, with a look of madden-
ing superiority. 
“If you don’t want to tell us, don’t,” snapped Ron. 
“Fine,” said Hermio ne haughtily, and she marched off. 
“She doesn’t know,” said Ron, staring resentfully after 
Hermione. “She’s just trying to get us to talk to her again.” 
 
At eight o’clock on Thursday evening, Harry left Gryffindor Tower for the History of Magic classroom . It was dark and empty when he 
arrived, but he lit the lamps with his wand and had waited only five 
minutes when Professor Lupin turned up, carrying a large packing 
case, which he heaved onto Professor Binns’ desk. 
“What’s that?” said Harry. 
“Another boggart,” said Lupin, stripping off his cloak. “I’ve been 
combing the castle ever since Tuesda y, and very luckily, I found this 
one lurking inside Mr. Filch’s filing cabinet. It’s the nearest we’ll get 
to a real dementor. The boggart will turn into a dementor when he 
sees you, so we’ll be able to practice on him. I can store him in my 
office when we’re not using him; th ere’s a cupboard under my desk 
he’ll like.” 
“Okay,” said Harry, trying to sound as though he wasn’t appre- 
 
THE PATRONUS 
 237  hensive at all and merely glad that Lupin had found such a good 
substitute for a real dementor. 
“So . . .” Professor Lupin had taken out his own wand, and in-
dicated that Harry should do the sa me. “The spell I am going to try 
and teach you is highly advanced magic, Harry — well beyond 
Ordinary Wizarding Le vel. It is called the Patronus Charm.” 
“How does it work?” said Harry nervously. “Well, when it works correctly, it conjures up a Patronus,” said 
Lupin, “which is a kind of anti-dementor — a guardian that acts as a shield between you and the dementor.” 
Harry had a sudden vision of himse lf crouching behind a Hagrid-
sized figure holding a large club. Professor Lupin continued, “The 
Patronus is a kind of positive forc e, a projection of the very things 
that the dementor feeds upon — hope, happiness, the desire to 
survive — but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the de-
mentors can’t hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm 
might be too advanced for you. Ma ny qualified wizards have diffi-
culty with it.” 
“What does a Patronus look li ke?” said Harry curiously. 
“Each one is unique to the wizard who conjures it.” 
“And how do you conjure it?” 
“With an incantation, which will work only if you are concen-
trating, with all your might, on a single, very happy memory.” 
Harry cast his mind about for a happy memory. Certainly, nothing 
that had happened to h im at the Dursleys’ was going to do. Finally, he 
settled on the moment when he had first ridden a broomstick. 
“Right,” he said, trying to recall as exactly as possible the won-
derful, soaring sensat ion of his stomach. 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 238  “The incantation is this —” Lupin cleared his throat. “ Expecto 
patronum !” 
“Expecto patronum ,” Harry repeated under his breath, “ expecto 
patronum. ” 
“Concentrating hard on your happy memory?” 
“Oh — yeah —” said Harry, quic kly forcing his thoughts back 
to that first broom ride. “ Expecto patrono — no, patronum — 
sorry — expecto patronum, expecto patronum —” 
Something whooshed suddenly out of the end of his wand; it 
looked like a wisp of silvery gas. 
“Did you see that?” said Harry excitedly. “Something happened!” 
“Very good,” said Lupin, smiling. “Right, then — ready to try it 
on a dementor?” 
“Yes,” Harry said, gripping his wand very tightly, and moving 
into the middle of th e deserted classroom. He tried to keep his 
mind on flying, but something else kept intruding. . . . Any second now, he might hear his mother again . . . but he shouldn’t think that, 
or he would hear her again, and he didn’t want to . . . or did he? 
Lupin grasped the lid of the packing case and pulled. 
A dementor rose slowly from th e box, its hooded face turned 
toward Harry, one glistening, scab bed hand gripping its cloak. The 
lamps around the classroom flicke red and went out. The dementor 
stepped from the box and started to sweep silently toward Harry, 
drawing a deep, rattling breath. A wave of piercing cold broke over 
him — 
“Expecto patronum !” Harry yelled. “ Expecto patronum ! Ex-
pecto —” 
But the classroom and the dementor were dissolving. . . . Harry 
 
THE PATRONUS 
 239  was falling again throug h thick white fog, and his mother’s voice 
was louder than ever, echoing inside his head — “ Not Harry ! Not 
Harry ! Please — I’ll do anything —” 
“Stand aside . Stand aside, girl !” 
“Harry!” 
Harry jerked back to life. He was lying flat on his back on the 
floor. The classroom lamps were alight again. He didn’t have to ask 
what had happened. 
“Sorry,” he muttered, sitting up and feeling cold sweat trickling 
down behind his glasses. 
“Are you all righ t?” said Lupin. 
“Yes . . .” Harry pulled himsel f up on one of the desks and 
leaned against it. 
“Here —” Lupin handed him a Chocolate Frog. “Eat this before 
we try again. I didn’t expect you to do it your first time; in fact, I 
would have been asto unded if you had.” 
“It’s getting worse,” Ha rry muttered, biting off the Frog’s head. 
“I could hear her louder that time — and him — Voldemort —” 
Lupin looked paler than usual. 
“Harry, if you don’t want to continue, I will more than under-
stand —” 
“I do!” said Harry fiercely, stuffing the rest of the Chocolate Frog 
into his mouth. “I’ve got to! What if the dementors turn up at our 
match against Ravenclaw? I can’t afford to fall off again. If we lose 
this game we’ve lost the Quidditch Cup!” 
“All right then . . . ,” said Lupin. “You might want to select 
another memory, a happy memory, I mean, to concentrate 
on. . . . That one doesn’t seem to have been strong enough. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 240  Harry thought hard and decided his feelings when Gryffindor 
had won the House Championship la st year had definitely quali-
fied as very happy. He gripped his wand tightly again and took up 
his position in the midd le of the classroom. 
“Ready?” said Lupin, gripping the box lid. “Ready,” said Harry, trying hard to fill his head with happy 
thoughts about Gryffi ndor winning, and not dark thoughts about 
what was going to happen when the box opened. 
“Go!” said Lupin, pulling off the lid. The room went icily cold 
and dark once more. The dementor glided forward, drawing its 
breath; one rotting hand was extending toward Harry — 
“Expecto patronum !” Harry yelled. “ Expecto patronum ! Expecto 
pat —” 
White fog obscured his senses . . . big, blurred shapes were mov-
ing around him . . . th en came a new voice, a man’s voice, shout-
ing, panicking — 
“Lily, take Harry and go ! It’s him ! Go! Run! I’ll hold him off —” 
The sounds of someone stumbling from a room — a door bursting 
open — a cackle of high-pitched laughter — 
“Harry! Harry . . . wake up. . . .” Lupin was tapping Harry hard on the face. This time it was a 
minute before Harry understood wh y he was lying on a dusty class-
room floor. 
“I heard my dad,” Harry mumbled. “That’s the first time I’ve 
ever heard him — he tried to take on Voldemort hi mself, to give 
my mum time to run for it. . . .” 
Harry suddenly realized that th ere were tears on his face min-
gling with the sweat. He bent his face as low as possible, wiping 
 
THE PATRONUS 
 241  them off on his robes, pretending to do up his shoelace, so that 
Lupin wouldn’t see. 
“You heard James?” said Lupin in a strange voice. 
“Yeah . . .” Face dry, Harry looked up. “Why — you didn’t 
know my dad, did you?” 
“I — I did, as a matter of fact,” said Lupin. “We were friends at 
Hogwarts. Listen, Harry — perhaps we should leave it here for 
tonight. This charm is ridiculously advanced. . . . I shouldn’t have 
suggested putting you through this. . . .” 
“No!” said Harry. He got up agai n. “I’ll have one more go! I’m 
not thinking of happy en ough things, that’s what it is. . . . Hang 
on. . . .” 
He racked his brains. A really, re ally happy memory . . . one that 
he could turn into a good, strong Patronus . . . 
The moment when he’d first found out he was a wizard, and 
would be leaving the Dursleys for Hogwarts! If that wasn’t a happy 
memory, he didn’ t know what was. . . . Concentrating very hard on how he had felt when he’d realized he’d be leaving Privet Drive, 
Harry got to his feet and face d the packing case once more. 
“Ready?” said Lupin, who looked as though he were doing this 
against his better judgment. “Concentrating hard? All right — go!” 
He pulled off the lid of the case for the third time, and the de-
mentor rose out of it; the room fell cold and dark — 
“EXPECTO PATRONUM !” Harry bellowed. “ EXPECTO PA-
TRONUM ! EXPECTO PATRONUM !” 
The screaming inside Harry’s head had started again — except 
this time, it sounded as though it were coming from a badly tuned 
radio — softer and louder and softer again — and he could still see 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 242  the dementor — it had halted — and then a huge, silver shadow 
came bursting out of the end of Harry’s wand, to hover between him 
and the dementor, and though Harry’s le gs felt like water, he was still 
on his feet — though for how much longer, he wasn’t sure — 
“Riddikulus !” roared Lupin, springing forward. 
There was a loud crack, and Harry’s cloudy Patronus vanished 
along with the dementor; he sank into a chair, feeling as exhausted 
as if he’d just run a mile, and fel t his legs shaking. Out of the cor-
ner of his eye, he saw Professor Lupin forcing the boggart back into 
the packing case with his wand; it had turned into a silvery orb 
again. 
“Excellent!” Lupin said, striding over to where Harry sat. “Ex-
cellent, Harry! That was definitely a start!” 
“Can we have another go? Just one more go?” 
“Not now,” said Lupin firmly. “Y ou’ve had enough for one night. 
Here —” 
He handed Harry a large bar of Honeydukes’ best chocolate. 
“Eat the lot, or Madam Pomfre y will be after my blood. Same 
time next week?” 
“Okay,” said Harry. He took a bi te of the chocolate and watched 
Lupin extinguishing the lamps that had rekindled with the disap-
pearance of the dementor. A thought had just occurred to him. 
“Professor Lupin?” he said. “If you knew my dad, you must’ve 
known Sirius Black as well.” 
Lupin turned very quickly. 
“What gives you that idea?” he said sharply. 
“Nothing — I mean, I just knew they were friends at Hogwarts 
too. . . .” 
 
THE PATRONUS 
 243  Lupin’s face relaxed. 
“Yes, I knew him,” he said shortly. “Or I thought I did. You’d 
better be off, Harry, it’s getting late.” 
Harry left the classroom, walking along the corridor and around 
a corner, then took a detour behind a suit of armor and sank down 
on its plinth to finish his chocol ate, wishing he hadn’t mentioned 
Black, as Lupin was obviously not keen on the subject. Then Harry’s thoughts wandered back to his mother and father. . . . 
He felt drained and strangely empt y, even though he was so full 
of chocolate. Terrible though it wa s to hear his parents’ last mo-
ments replayed inside his head, these were the only times Harry 
had heard their voices since he was a very sm all child. But he’d 
n e v e r b e a b l e t o p r o d u c e a p r o p e r P a t r o n u s i f h e h a l f w a n t e d t o 
hear his parent s again. . . . 
“They’re dead,” he told himself sternly. “They’re dead and lis-
tening to echoes of them won’t bring them back. You’d better get a 
grip on yourself if you want that Quidditch Cup.” 
He stood up, crammed the last bit of chocolate into his mouth, 
and headed back to Gryffindor Tower. 
 
Ravenclaw played Slytherin a week after the start of term. Slytherin won, though narrowly. According to Wood, this was good news for 
Gryffindor, who would take second place if they beat Ravenclaw 
too. He therefore increased the numb er of team practices to five a 
week. This meant that with Lupin’ s anti-dementor classes, which in 
themselves were more draining th an six Quidditch practices, Harry 
had just one night a week to do all his homework. Even so, he 
wasn’t showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 244  immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her. Every night, 
without fail, Hermione was to be seen in a corner of the common 
room, several tables spread with books, Arithmancy charts, rune dictionaries, diagrams of Muggles lifting heavy objects, and file 
upon file of extensive notes; she barely spoke to anybody and snapped when she was interrupted. 
“How’s she doing it?” Ron mutt ered to Harry one evening as 
Harry sat finishing a nasty essay on Undetectable Poisons for Snape. Harry looked up. Hermione was barely visible behind a tot-
tering pile of books. 
“Doing what?” 
“Getting to all her classes!” Ron said. “I heard her talking to Pro-
fessor Vector, that Arithmancy witch, this morning. They were go-ing on about yesterday’s lesson, but Hermione can’t’ve been there, 
because she was with us in Care of Magical Creatures! And Ernie 
McMillan told me she’s never miss ed a Muggle Studies class, but 
h a l f o f t h e m a r e a t t h e s a m e t i me as Divination, and she’s never 
missed one of them either!” 
Harry didn’t have time to fathom the mystery of Hermione’s im-
possible schedule at the moment; he really needed to get on with 
Snape’s essay. Two seconds later, ho wever, he was interrupted again, 
this time by Wood. 
“Bad news, Harry. I’ve just be en to see Professor McGonagall 
about the Firebolt. She — er — got a bit shirty with me. Told me 
I’d got my priorities wrong. Seemed to think I cared more about 
winning the Cup than I do about yo u staying alive. Just because I 
told her I didn ’ t care if it threw you off, as long as you caught the 
Snitch first.” Wood shook his head in disbelief. “Honestly, the 
 
THE PATRONUS 
 245  way she was yelling at me . . . yo u’d think I’d said something terri-
ble. . . . Then I asked her how mu ch longer she was going to keep 
it. . . .” He screwed up his face and imitated Professor McGona-
g a l l ’ s s e v e r e v o i c e . “‘ A s l o n g a s n e c e s s a r y , W o o d ’ . . . I r e c k o n i t ’ s 
time you ordered a new broom, Harry. There’s an order form at the 
back of Which Broomstick . . . you could get a Nimbus Two Thou-
sand and One, like Malfoy’s got.” 
“I’m not buying anything Malfoy thinks is good,” said Harry 
flatly. 
 
January faded impercepti bly into February, with no change in the 
bitterly cold weather. The matc h against Ravenclaw was drawing 
nearer and nearer, but Harry stil l hadn’t ordered a new broom. He 
was now asking Professor McGonagall for news of the Firebolt af-
ter every Transfigurat ion lesson, Ron standi ng hopefully at his 
shoulder, Hermione rushing past with her face averted. 
“No, Potter, you can’t have it back yet,” Professor McGonagall 
told him the twelfth time this happened, before he’d even opened 
his mouth. “We’ve checked for most of the usual curses, but Pro-
fessor Flitwick believes the br oom might be carrying a Hurling 
Hex. I shall tell you once we’ve finished checking it. Now, please 
stop badgering me.” 
To make matters even worse, Ha rry’s anti-dementor lessons were 
not going nearly as well as he ha d hoped. Several sessions on, he 
was able to produce an indistinct , silvery shadow every time the 
boggart-dementor approached hi m, but his Patronus was too 
feeble to drive the dementor away. All it did was hover, like a semi-
transparent cloud, draining Harry of energy as he fought to keep it 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 246  there. Harry felt angry with himself, guilty ab out his secret desire 
to hear his parent s’ voices again. 
“You’re expecting too much of yourself,” said Professor Lupin 
sternly in their fourth week of practice. “For a thirteen-year-old 
wizard, even an indistinct Patronus is a huge achievement. You 
aren’t passing out anymore, are you?” 
“I thought a Patronus would — charge the dementors down or 
something,” said Harry dispirit edly. “Make them disappear —” 
“The true Patronus does do that,” said Lupin. “But you’ve 
achieved a great deal in a very sh ort space of time. If the dementors 
put in an appear ance at your next Quiddi tch match, you will be 
able to keep them at bay long en ough to get back to the ground.” 
“You said it’s harder if there are loads of them,” said Harry. “I have complete confidence in you,” said Lupin, smiling. 
“Here — you’ve earned a drink — something from the Three Broomsticks. You won’t have tried it before —” 
He pulled two bottles out of his briefcase. 
“Butterbeer!” said Harry, withou t thinking. “Yeah, I like that 
stuff!” 
Lupin raised an eyebrow. 
“Oh — Ron and Hermione brou ght me some back from 
Hogsmeade,” Harry lied quickly. 
“I see,” said Lupin, though he still looked slightly suspicious. 
“Well — let’s drink to a Gryffindor victory against Ravenclaw! Not 
that I’m supposed to take sides, as a teacher . . . ,” he added hastily. 
They drank the butterbeer in silence, until Harry voiced some-
thing he’d been wond ering for a while. 
“What’s under a de mentor’s hood?” 
 
THE PATRONUS 
 247  Professor Lupin lowered his bottle thoughtfully. 
“Hmmm . . . well, the only people who rea lly know are in no 
condition to tell us. You see, the dementor lowers its hood only to 
use its last and worst weapon.” 
“What’s that?” “They call it the Dementor’s Kiss,” said Lupin, with a slightly 
twisted smile. “It’s what dementors do to those they wish to destroy 
utterly. I suppose there must be some kind of mouth under there, because they clamp their jaws upon the mouth of the victim 
and — and suck out his soul.” 
Harry accidentally spat out a bit of butterbeer. “What — they kill — ?” 
“Oh no,” said Lupin. “Much wors e than that. You can exist with-
out your soul, you know, as long as your brain and heart are still 
working. But you’ll have no sense of self anymore, no memory, 
no . . . anything. There’s no chance at all of recovery. You’ll just — 
exist. As an empty shell. And your soul is gone forever . . . lost.” 
Lupin drank a little more butterbeer, then said, “It’s the fate that 
awaits Sirius Black. It was in the Daily Prophet this morning. The 
Ministry have given the dementors permission to perform it if they 
find him.” 
Harry sat stunned for a moment at the idea of someone having 
their soul sucked out through thei r mouth. But then he thought of 
Black. 
“He deserves it,” he said suddenly. 
“You think so?” said Lupin lightly. “Do you really think anyone 
deserves that?” 
“Yes,” said Harry defi antly. “For . . . for some things . . .” 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 248  He would have liked to have told Lupin about the conversation 
he’d overheard about Black in the Three Broomsticks, about Black 
betraying his mother and father, but it would have involved reveal-

terbeer, thanked Lupin, and left the History of Magic classroom. 
Harry half wished that he hadn ’t asked what was under a de-
mentor’s hood, the answer had been so horrible, and he was so lost 
in unpleasant thoughts of what it would feel like to have your soul 
sucked out of you that he walked headlong into Professor McGo-
nagall halfway up the stairs. 
“Do watch where you’re going, Potter!” 
“Sorry, Professor —” 
“I’ve just been looking for you in the Gryffindor common room. 
Well, here it is, we’ve done everything we could think of, and there doesn ’ t seem to be anything wrong with it at all. You’ve got a very good friend somewher e, Potter. . . .” 
Harry’s jaw dropped. She was holding out his Firebolt, and it 
looked as magnificent as ever. 
“I can have it back?” Har ry said weakly. “Seriously?” 
“Seriously,” said Professor Mc Gonagall, and she was actually 
smiling. “I daresay you’ll need to get the feel of it before Saturday’s 
match, won’t you? And Potter — do try and win, won’t you? Or 
we’ll be out of the running for the eighth year in a row, as Profes-
sor Snape was kind enough to remi nd me only last night. . . .” 
Speechless, Harry carried the Firebolt back upst airs toward 
Gryffindor Tower. As he turned a corner, he saw Ron dashing 
toward him, grinning from ear to ear. 
 
THE PATRONUS 
 249  “She gave it to you? Excellent! Listen, can I still have a go on it? 
Tomorrow?” 
“Yeah . . . anything . . . ,” said Harry, his heart lighter than it 
had been in a month. “You know wh at — we should make up with 
Hermione. . . . She was only trying to help. . . .” 
“Yeah, all right,” said Ron. “S he’s in the common room now — 
working, for a change —” 
They turned into the corridor to Gryffindor Tower and saw 
Neville Longbottom, pleading with S i r C a d o g a n , w h o s e e m e d t o 
be refusing him entrance. 
“I wrote them down!” Neville was saying tearfully. “But I 
must’ve dropped them somewhere!” 
“A likely tale!” roared Sir Cadogan. Then, spotting Harry and 
Ron: “Good even, my fine young yeomen! Come clap this loon in 
irons. He is trying to force entry to the chambers within!” 
“ O h , s h u t u p , ” s a i d R o n a s h e a n d H a r r y d r e w l e v e l w i t h 
Neville. 
“I’ve lost the passwords!” Neville told them miserably. “I made 
him tell me what passwords he was going to use this week, because 
he keeps changing them, and now I don’t know what I’ve done 
with them!” 
“Oddsbodikins,” said Harry to Sir Cadogan, who looked ex-
tremely disappointed and reluctan tly swung forward to let them 
into the common room. There was a sudden, excited murmur as 
every head turned and the next moment, Harry was surrounded by 
people exclaiming over his Firebolt. 
“Where’d you get it, Harry?” “Will you let me have a go?” 
 
CHAPTER TWELVE 
 250  “Have you ridden it yet, Harry?” 
“Ravenclaw’ll have no chance , they’re all on Cleansweep 
Sevens!” 
“Can I just hold it, Harry?” 
After ten minutes or so, during which the Firebolt was passed 
around and admired from every angle, the crowd dispersed and 
Harry and Ron had a clear view of Hermione, the only person who 
hadn’t rushed over to them, bent over her work and carefully avoid-
ing their eyes. Harry and Ron approa ched her table and at last, she 
looked up. 
“I got it back,” said Harry, gri nning at her and holding up the 
Firebolt. 
“See, Hermione? There wasn’t an ything wrong with it!” said 
Ron. 
“Well — there might have been!” said He rmione. “I mean, at 
least you know now that it’s safe!” 
“Yeah, I suppose so,” said Harry. “I’d better put it upstairs —” 
“I’ll take it!” said Ron eagerly. “I’ve got to give Scabbers his rat 
tonic.” 
He took the Firebolt and, holding it as if it were made of glass, 
carried it away up the boys’ staircase. 
“Can I sit down, then?” Harry asked Hermione. 
“I suppose so,” said Hermione, moving a great stack of parch-
ment off a chair. 
Harry looked around at the clutte red table, at the long Arith-
mancy essay on which the ink was st ill glistening, at the even longer 
Muggle Studies essay (“Explain Why Muggles Need Electricity”) 
and at the rune translation He rmione was now poring over. 
“How are you getting through all this stuff?” Harry asked her. 
THE PATRONUS

Close-up, Harry saw that she look ed almost as tired as Lupin. 
“Why don’t you just drop a coup le of subjects?” Harry asked, 
watching her lifting books as she searched for her rune dictionary. 
“I couldn’t do that!” said He rmione, looking scandalized. 
“Arithmancy looks terrible,” sa id Harry, picking up a very com-
plicated-looking number chart. 
“Oh no, it’s wonderful!” said He rmione earnestly. “It’s my fa-
vorite subject! It’s —” 
But exactly what was wonderful about Arithmancy, Harry never 
found out. At that precise mome nt, a strangled ye ll echoed down 
the boys’ staircase. The whole co mmon room fell silent, staring, 
petrified, at the entrance. Then came hurried footsteps, growing 
louder and louder — and then Ron came leaping into view, drag-
ging with him a bedsheet. 
“LOOK!” he bellowed, striding over to Hermione’s table. 
“LOOK!” he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face. 
“Ron, what — ?” 
“SCABBERS! LOOK! SCABBERS!” 
Hermione was leaning away from Ron, looking utterly bewil-
dered. Harry looked down at the sheet Ron was holding. There was 
something red on it. Something that looked horribly like — 
“BLOOD!” Ron yelled into the stunned silence. “HE’S GONE! 
AND YOU KNOW WHAT WAS ON THE FLOOR?” 
“N — no,” said Hermione in a trembling voice. 
Ron threw something down onto Hermione’s rune translation. 
Hermione and Harry leaned forward. Lying on top of the weird, spiky shapes were several long, ginger cat hairs.

t looked like the end of Ron and Hermione’s friendship. Each 
was so angry with the other that Harry couldn’t see how they’d 
ever make up. 
Ron was enraged that Hermione had never taken Crookshanks’s 
attempts to eat Scabbers seriously, hadn’t bothered to keep a close 
enough watch on him, and was stil l trying to pretend that Crook-
shanks was innocent by suggesting that Ron look for Scabbers un-
der all the boys’ beds. Hermione, meanwhile, maintained fiercely 
that Ron had no proof that Crook shanks had eaten Scabbers, that 
the ginger hairs might have been there since Christmas, and that 
Ron had been prejudiced against her cat ever since Crookshanks 
had landed on Ron’s head in the Magical Menagerie. 
Personally, Harry was sure that Crookshanks had eaten Scab-
bers, and when he tried to point out to Hermione that the evidence 
all pointed that way, she lost her temper with Harry too. 
 I 
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW 
 253  “Okay, side with Ron, I knew you would!” she said shrilly. “First 
the Firebolt, now Scabbers, everything’ s my fault, isn’t it! Just leave 
me alone, Harry, I’ve go t a lot of work to do!” 
Ron had taken the loss of his rat very hard indeed. 
“Come on, Ron, you were always saying how boring Scabbers 
was,” said Fred bracingly “And he ’s been off-color for ages, he was 
wasting away. It was probably bett er for him to snuff it quickly — 
one swallow — he probably didn’t feel a thing.” 
“Fred!” said Ginny indignantly. 
“All he did was eat and sleep, Ron, you said it yourself,” said 
George. 
“He bit Goyle for us once!” Ro n said miserably. “Remember, 
Harry?” 
“Yeah, that’s true ,” said Harry. 
“His finest hour,” said Fred, unable to keep a straight face. “Let 
the scar on Goyle’s finger stand as a lasting tribute to his memory. 
Oh, come on, Ron, get yourself down to Hogsmeade and buy a 
new rat, what’s the point of moaning?” 
In a last-ditch attempt to cheer Ron up, Harry persuaded him to 
come along to the Gryffindor te am’s final practice before the 
Ravenclaw match, so that he could have a ride on the Firebolt after 
they’d finished. This did seem to take Ron’s mind off Scabbers for 
a moment (“Great! Can I try and sh oot a few goals on it?”) so they 
set off for the Quiddi tch field together. 
Madam Hooch, who was still overs eeing Gryffindor practices to 
keep an eye on Harry, was just as impressed with the Firebolt as 
everyone else had been. She took it in her hands before takeoff and gave them the benefit of her professional opinion. 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 254  “Look at the balance on it! If the Nimbus series has a fault, it’s a 
slight list to the tail end — you often find they develop a drag after 
a few years. They’ve updated the handle too, a bit slimmer than the 
Cleansweeps, reminds me of the ol d Silver Arrows — a pity they’ve 
stopped making them. I learned to fly on one, and a very fine old 
broom it was too. . . .” 
She continued in this vein for some time, until Wood said, 
“Er — Madam Hooch? Is it okay if Harry has the Firebolt back? 
We need to practice. . . .” 
“Oh — right — here you are, then, Potter,” said Madam 
Hooch. “I’ll sit over he re with Weasley . . .” 
She and Ron left the field to sit in the stadium, and the 
Gryffindor team gathered around Wood for his fina l instructions 
for tomorrow’s match. 
“Harry, I’ve just found out who Ravenclaw is playing as Seeker. 
It’s Cho Chang. She’s a fourth year, and she’s pretty good. . . . I really hoped she wouldn’t be fit, she’s had some problems with in-
juries. . . .” Wood scowled his displeasure that Cho Chang had 
made a full recovery, then said, “On the other hand, she rides a 
Comet Two Sixty, which is going to look like a joke next to the 
Firebolt.” He gave Harry’s broom a look of fervent admiration, 
then said, “Okay, ev eryone, let’s go —” 
And at long last, Harry mounte d his Firebolt, and kicked off 
from the ground. 
It was better than he’d ever dr eamed. The Firebolt turned with 
the lightest touch; it seemed to obey his thoughts rather than his 
grip; it sped across the field at su ch speed that the stadium turned 
into a green-and-gray blur; Harry tu rned it so sharply that Alicia 
 
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW 
 255  Spinnet screamed, then he went in to a perfectly controlled dive, 
brushing the grassy field with his toes before rising thirty, forty, 
fifty feet into the air again — 
“Harry, I’m letting the Snitch out! ” Wood called. 
Harry turned and raced a Bludger toward the goal posts; he out-
stripped it easily, saw the Snitch dart out from behind Wood, and 
within ten seconds had caught it tightly in his hand. 
The team cheered madly. Harry let th e Snitch go again, gave it a 
minute’s head start, then tore after it, weaving in and out of the 
others; he spotted it lurking near Katie Bell’s knee, looped her eas-
ily, and caught it again. 
It was the best practice ever; the team, inspired by the presence 
of the Firebolt in their midst, performed their be st moves fault-
lessly, and by the time they hit th e ground again, Wood didn’t have 
a single criticism to make, which, as George Weasley pointed out, 
was a first. 
“I can’t see what’s going to stop us tomorrow!” said Wood. “Not 
unless — Harry, you’ve sorted out your dementor problem, haven’t 
you?” 
“Yeah,” said Harry, thinking of his feeble Patronus and wishing 
it were stronger. 
“The dementors won’t turn up again, Oliver. Dumbledore’d go 
ballistic,” said Fred confidently. 
“Well, let’s hope not,” said Wood. “Anyway — good work, 
everyone. Let’s get back to the tower . . . turn in early —” 
“I’m staying out for a bit; Ron wants a go on the Firebolt,” 
Harry told Wood, and while the rest of the team he aded off to the 
locker rooms, Harry strode over to Ron, who vaulted the barrier to 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 256  the stands and came to meet hi m. Madam Hooch had fallen asleep 
in her seat. 
“Here you go,” said Harry, handing Ron the Firebolt. 
Ron, an expression of ecstasy on his face, mounted the broom 
and zoomed off into the gather ing darkness while Harry walked 
around the edge of the field, watc hing him. Night had fallen before 
Madam Hooch awoke with a start, told Harry and Ron off for not 
waking her, and insisted that they go back to the castle. 
Harry shouldered the Firebolt and he and Ron walked out of the 
shadowy stadium, discussing the Firebolt’s superbly smooth action, 
its phenomenal acceleration, and it s pinpoint turning. They were 
halfway toward the ca stle when Harry, glanci ng to his left, saw 
something that made his heart turn over — a pair of eyes, gleam-
ing out of the darkness. 
Harry stopped dead, his hear t banging against his ribs. 
“What’s the matter?” said Ron. Harry pointed. Ron pulled out his wand and muttered, “ Lumos !” 
A beam of light fell across the grass, hit the bottom of a tree, and 
illuminated its branches; there, crouching among the budding 
leaves, was Crookshanks. 
“Get out of here!” Ron roared, and he stooped down and seized 
a stone lying on the grass, but b efore he could do anything else, 
Crookshanks had vanished with one swish of his long ginger tail. 
“See?” Ron said furiously, chucki ng the stone down again. “She’s 
still letting him wander about wherever he wants — probably 
washing down Scabbers with a couple of birds now. . . .” 
Harry didn’t say anything. He took a deep breath as relief seeped 
through him; he had been sure for a moment that those eyes had 
 
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW 
 257  belonged to the Grim . They set off for the castle once more. 
Slightly ashamed of his moment of panic, Harry didn’t say any-
thing to Ron — nor did he look left or right until they had reached 
the well-lit entrance hall. 
 
Harry went down to breakfast the next morning with the rest 
of the boys in his dormitory, a ll of whom seemed to think the 
Firebolt deserved a sort of guard of honor. As Harry entered the Great Hall, heads turned in the direction of the Firebolt, and there 
was a good deal of excited mutter ing. Harry saw, with enormous 
satisfaction, that the Slytherin team were all looking thunder-
struck. 
“Did you see his face?” said Ro n gleefully, looking back at Mal-
foy. “He can’t believe it! This is brilliant!” 
Wood, too, was basking in the r eflected glory of the Firebolt. 
“Put it here, Harry,” he said, laying the broom in the middle 
of the table and carefully turning it so that its name faced 
upward. People from the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables were 
soon coming over to look. Cedric Diggory came over to congratu-
late Harry on having acquired su ch a superb replacement for his 
Nimbus, and Percy’s Ravenclaw gi rlfriend, Penelope Clearwater, 
asked if she could actual ly hold the Firebolt. 
“Now, now, Penny, no sabotage!” said Percy heartily as she 
examined the Firebolt closely “Penel ope and I have got a bet on,” he 
told the team. “Ten Galleons on the outcome of the match!” 
Penelope put the Firebolt down ag ain, thanked Harry, and went 
back to her table. 
“Harry — make sure you win,” said Percy, in an ur gent whisper. 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 258  “I haven’t got ten Galleons. Yes, I’m coming, Penny!” And he bustled 
off to join her in a piece of toast. 
“Sure you can manage that broom, Potter?” said a cold, drawling 
voice. 
Draco Malfoy had arrived for a closer look, Crabbe and Goyle 
right behind him. 
“Yeah, reckon so,” said Harry casually. 
“Got plenty of special features, hasn’t it?” said Malfoy, eyes glit-
tering maliciously. “Shame it doe sn’t come with a parachute — in 
case you get too ne ar a dementor.” 
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. 
“Pity you can’t attach an extra arm to yours, Malfoy,” said Harry. 
“Then it could catch the Snitch for you.” 
The Gryffindor team laughed loudly. Malfoy’s pale eyes nar-
rowed, and he stalked away. They watched him rejoin the rest of the Slytherin team, who put their heads together, no doubt asking Malfoy whether Harry’s broom really was a Firebolt. 
At a quarter to eleven, the Gryffi ndor team set off for the locker 
rooms. The weather couldn’t have been more different from their 
match against Hufflepuff. It was a clear, cool day with a very light 
breeze; there would be no visibili ty problems this time, and Harry, 
though nervous, was starting to feel the excitement only a Quid-
ditch match could bring. They coul d hear the rest of the school 
moving into the stadium beyond. Harry took off his black school 
robes, removed his wand from his pocket, and stuck it inside the 
T-shirt he was going to wear under his Quidditch robes. He only 
hoped he wouldn’t need it. He wondered suddenly whether Profes-sor Lupin was in th e crowd, watching. 
 
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW 
 259  “You know what we’ve got to do,” said Wood as they prepared to 
leave the locker rooms. “If we lose this match, we’re out of the run-
ning. Just — just fly like you did in practice yesterday, and we’ll be 
okay!” 
They walked out onto the field to tumultuous applause. The 
Ravenclaw team, dressed in blue, we re already standing in the mid-
dle of the field. Their Seeker, Cho Chang, was the only girl on their 
team. She was shorter than Harr y by about a head, and Harry 
couldn’t help noticing, nervous as he was, that she was extremely 
pretty. She smiled at Harry as th e teams faced each other behind 
their captains, and he fe lt a slight lurch in th e region of his stom-
ach that he didn’t think ha d anything to do with nerves. 
“Wood, Davies, shake hands,” Ma dam Hooch said briskly, and 
Wood shook hands with the Ravenclaw Captain. 
“Mount your brooms . . . on my whistle . . . three — two — 
one —” 
Harry kicked off into the air and the Firebolt zoomed higher 
and faster than any other broom; he soared around the stadium 
and began squinting around for th e Snitch, listening all the while 
to the commentary, which was be ing provided by the Weasley 
twins’ friend Lee Jordan. 
“They’re off, and the big excitem ent this match is the Firebolt 
that Harry Potter is flying for Gryffindor. According to Which 
Broomstick, the Firebolt’s going to be the broom of choice for the 
national teams at this year’s World Championship —” 
“Jordan, would you mind telling us what’s going on in the 
match?” interrupted Profes sor McGonagall’s voice. 
“Right you are, Professor — just giving a bit of background 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 260  information — the Firebolt, incident ally, has a built-in auto-brake 
and —” 
“Jordan!” 
“Okay, okay, Gryffindor in possession, Katie Bell of Gryffindor 
heading for goal . . .” 
Harry streaked past Katie in th e opposite direction, gazing 
around for a glint of gold and no ticing that Cho Chang was tailing 
him closely. She was undoubtedly a very good flier — she kept cut-ting across him, forcing him to change direction. 
“Show her your acceleration, Harry!” Fred yelled as he 
whooshed past in pursuit of a Bl udger that was aiming for Alicia. 
Harry urged the Firebolt forward as they rounded the Raven-
claw goal posts and Ch o fell behind. Just as Katie succeeded in 
scoring the first goal of the match, and the Gryffindor end of the 
field went wild, he saw it — the Snitch was close to the ground, 
flitting near one of the barriers. 
Harry dived; Cho saw what he wa s doing and tore after him — 
Harry was speeding up, excitement flooding him; dives were his 
speciality, he wa s ten feet away — 
Then a Bludger, hit by one of th e Ravenclaw Beaters, came pelt-
ing out of nowhere; Harry veered off course, avoiding it by an inch, 
and in those few, cr ucial seconds, the Sn itch had vanished. 
There was a great “Ooooooh” of disappointment from the 
Gryffindor supporters, but much applause for their Beater from 
the Ravenclaw end. George Weasley vented his feelings by hitting 
the second Bludger directly at th e offending Beater, who was forced 
to roll right over in midair to avoid it. 
“Gryffindor leads by eighty points to zero, and look at that 
 
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW 
 261  Firebolt go! Potter’s really putting it through its paces now, see it 
turn — Chang’s Comet is just no match for it, the Firebolt’s 
precision-balance is really no ticeable in these long —” 
“JORDAN! ARE YOU BEING PAID TO ADVERTISE FIRE-
BOLTS? GET ON WITH THE COMMENTARY!” 
Ravenclaw was pulling back; they had now scored three goals, 
which put Gryffindor only fifty points ahead — if Cho got the 
Snitch before him, Ravenclaw would win. Harry dropped lower, 
narrowly avoiding a Ravenclaw Chas er, scanning the field franti-
cally — a glint of gold, a flutter of tiny wings — the Snitch was 
circling the Gryffindor goal post — 
Harry accelerated, eyes fixed on the speck of gold ahead — but 
just then, Cho appeared out of thin air, blocking him — 
“HARRY, THIS IS NO TIME TO BE A GENTLEMAN!” 
Wood roared as Harry swerved to avoid a collision. “KNOCK 
HER OFF HER BROOM IF YOU HAVE TO!” 
Harry turned and caught sight of Cho; she was grinning. The 
Snitch had vanished again. Har ry turned his Firebolt upward 
and was soon twenty feet above th e game. Out of the corner of 
his eye, he saw Cho following hi m. . . . She’d decided to mark 
him rather than search for the Snitch herself. . . . All right, then . . . if she wanted to tail hi m, she’d have to take the conse-
quences. . . . 
He dived again, and Cho, thinking he’d seen the Snitch, tried to 
follow; Harry pulled out of the di ve very sharply; she hurtled 
downward; he rose fast as a bulle t once more, and then saw it, for 
the third time — the Snitch was gl ittering way above the field at 
the Ravenclaw end. 
 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 262  He accelerated; so, many feet below, did Cho. He was winning, 
gaining on the Snitch with every second — then — 
“Oh!” screamed Cho, pointing. 
Distracted, Harry looked down. 
Three dementors, three tall, black, hooded dementors, were 
looking up at him. 
He didn’t stop to think. Plungi ng a hand down the neck of his 
robes, he whipped out his wand and roared, “ Expecto patronum !” 
Something silver-white, somethin g enormous, erupted from the 
end of his wand. He knew it had sh ot directly at the dementors but 
didn’t pause to watch; his mind still miraculously clear, he looked 
ahead — he was nearly there. He stretched out the hand still grasp-
ing his wand and just managed to close his fingers over the small, 
struggling Snitch. 
Madam Hooch’s whistle sounded. Harry turned around in 
midair and saw six scarlet blurs bearing down on him; next mo-
ment, the whole team was hugging him so hard he was nearly 
pulled off his broom. Down below he could hear the roars of the 
Gryffindors in the crowd. 
“That’s my boy!” Wood kept yell ing. Alicia, Ange lina, and Katie 
had all kissed Harry; Fred had him in a grip so ti ght Harry felt as 
though his head would come off. In complete disarray, the team managed to make its way back to the ground. Harry got off his 
broom and looked up to see a ga ggle of Gryffindor supporters 
sprinting onto the field, Ron in th e lead. Before he knew it, he had 
been engulfed by th e cheering crowd. 
“Yes!” Ron yelled, yanking Harry’s arm into the air. “Yes! Yes!” 
“Well done, Harry!” said Percy, lookin g delighted. “Ten Galleons 
to me! Must find Pene lope, excuse me —” 
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW 
 263  “Good for you, Harry!” ro ared Seamus Finnigan. 
“Ruddy brilliant!” boomed Hagrid over the heads of the milling 
Gryffindors. 
“That was quite some Patronus,” said a voice in Harry’s ear. 
Harry turned around to see Pro fessor Lupin, who looked both 
shaken and pleased. 
“The dementors didn’t affect me at all!” Harry said excitedly. “I 
didn’t feel a thing!” 
“That would be because they — er — weren’t dementors,” said 
Professor Lupin. “Come and see —” 
He led Harry out of the crowd un til they were able to see the 
edge of the field. 
“You gave Mr. Malfoy quit e a fright,” said Lupin. 
Harry stared. Lying in a crumpled heap on the ground were 
Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Marcus Flint, the Slytherin team Cap-
tain, all struggling to remove them selves from long, black, hooded 
robes. It looked as though Malf oy had been standing on Goyle’s 
shoulders. Standing over them, wi th an expression of the utmost 
fury on her face, was Professor McGonagall. 
“An unworthy trick!” she was shou ting. “A low and cowardly at-
tempt to sabotage the Gryffindor Seeker! Detention for all of you, 
and fifty points from Slytherin! I shall be speaking to Professor 
Dumbledore about this, ma ke no mistake! Ah, here he comes now!” 
If anything could have set the seal on Gryffindor’s victory, it 
was this. Ron, who had fought his way through to Harry’s side, 
doubled up with laughter as they watched Malfoy fighting to extri-
cate himself from the robe, Goyl e’s head still stuck inside it. 
“Come on, Harry!” said George, fighting his way over. “Party! 
Gryffindor common room, now!” 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 264  “Right,” said Harry, and feeling happier than he had in ages, he 
and the rest of the team led the way, still in their sc arlet robes, out 
of the stadium and back up to the castle. 
 
It felt as though th ey had already won th e Quidditch Cup; the 
party went on all day and well in to the night. Fred and George 
Weasley disappeared for a couple of hours and returned with arm-
fuls of bottles of butt erbeer, pumpkin fizz, and several bags full of 
Honeydukes sweets. 
“How did you do that?” squealed Angelina Johnson as George 
started throwing Peppermint Toads into the crowd. 
“With a little help from M oony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and 
Prongs,” Fred muttered in Harry’s ear. 
Only one person wasn’t joining in the festivities. Hermione, in-
credibly, was sitting in a corner, attempting to read an enormous 
book entitled Home Life and Social Habits of British Muggles. Harry 
broke away from the table where Fred and George had started jug-
gling butterbeer bottles and went over to her. 
“Did you even come to th e match?” he asked her. 
“Of course I did,” said Hermio ne in a strangely high-pitched 
voice, not looking up. “And I’m ve ry glad we won, and I think you 
did really well, but I need to read this by Monday.” 
“Come on, Hermione, come and have some food,” Harry said, 
looking over at Ron and wondering whether he was in a good enough mood to bury the hatchet. 
“I can’t, Harry. I’ve still got fo ur hundred and twenty-two pages 
to read!” said Hermione, now sounding slightly hy sterical. “Any-
way . . .” She glanced over at Ron too. “ He doesn’t want me to 
join in.” 
GRYFFINDOR VERSUS RAVENCLAW 
 265  There was no arguing with this, as Ron chose that moment to 
say loudly, “If Scabbers hadn ’ t just been eaten, he could have had 
some of those Fudge Flies. He used to really like them —” 
Hermione burst in to tears. Before Harry could say or do any-
thing, she tucked the enormous b ook under her arm, and, still sob-
bing, ran toward the st aircase to the girls’ dormitories and out of 
sight. 
“Can’t you give her a break? ” Harry asked Ron quietly. 
“No,” said Ron flatly. “If she just acted like she was sorry — but 
she’ll never admit she’s wrong, He rmione. She’s still acting like 
Scabbers has gone on va cation or something.” 
The Gryffindor party ended on ly when Professor McGonagall 
turned up in her tartan dressing gown and hair net at one in the 
morning, to insist that they all go to bed. Harry and Ron climbed 
the stairs to their dormitory, still discussing the match. At last, ex-
hausted, Harry climbed into bed, twitched the hangings of his 
four-poster shut to block out a ray of moonlight, lay back, and felt 
himself almost instantly drif ting off to sleep. . . . 
He had a very strange dream. He was walking through a forest, 
his Firebolt over his shoulder, foll owing something silvery-white. It 
was winding its way through the trees ahead, and he could only 
catch glimpses of it between the leav es. Anxious to catch up with it, 
he sped up, but as he moved fast er, so did his quarry. Harry broke 
into a run, and ahead he heard hooves gathering speed. Now he was running flat out, and ahead he could hear galloping. Then he 
turned a corner into a clearing and — 
“AAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH! 
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!” 
Harry woke as suddenly as though he’d been hit in the face. 
CHAPTER THIRTEEN 
 266  Disoriented in the total darkness, he fumbled with his hangings — 
he could hear moveme nts around him, and Seamus Finnigan’s 
voice from the other side of the room: “What’ s going on?” 
Harry thought he heard the dormitory door slam . At last finding 
the divide in his curtains, he ri pped them back, and at the same 
moment, Dean Thomas lit his lamp. 
Ron was sitting up in bed, the hangings torn from one side, a 
look of utmost terror on his face. 
“Black! Sirius Black! With a knife!” 
“What ?” 
“Here! Just now! Slashed th e curtains! Woke me up!” 
“You sure you weren’t dr eaming, Ron?” said Dean. 
“Look at the curtains! I te ll you, he was here!” 
They all scrambled out of bed; Harry reached the dormitory 
door first, and they sprinted back down the staircase. Doors opened 
behind them, and sleepy voic es called after them. 
“Who shouted?” 
“What’re you doing?” 
The common room was lit with the glow of the dying fire, still 
littered with the debris from the party. It was deserted. 
“Are you sure you weren’t dreaming, Ron?” 
“I’m telling you, I saw him!” 
“What’s all the noise?” 
“Professor McGonagall told us to go to bed!” A few of the girls had come down their staircase, pulling on 
dressing gowns and yawning. Bo ys, too, were reappearing. 
“Excellent, are we carrying on?” said Fred Weasley brightly. 
“Everyone back upstairs!” said Percy, hurrying into the

 267  common room and pinning his Head Boy badge to his pajamas as 
he spoke. 
“Perce — Sirius Black!” said Ron faintly. “In our dormitory! 
With a knife! Woke me up!” 
The common room went very still. 
“Nonsense!” said Percy, looking startled. “You had too much to 
eat, Ron — had a nightmare —” 
“I’m telling you —” “Now, really, enough’s enough!” 
Professor McGonagall was back. She slammed the portrait be-
hind her as she entered the co mmon room and stared furiously 
around. 
“I am delighted that Gryffindor won the match, but this is get-
ting ridiculous! Percy, I expected better of you!” 
“I certainly didn’t authorize this , Professor!” said Percy, puffing 
himself up indignantly. “I was just telling them all to get back to 
bed! My brother Ron here had a nightmare —” 
“IT WASN’T A NIGHTMARE!” Ron yelled. “PROFESSOR, I 
WOKE UP, AND SIRIUS BLACK WAS STANDING OVER 
ME, HOLDING A KNIFE!” 
Professor McGonagall stared at him. 
“Don’t be ridiculous, Weasley, how could he possibly have got-
ten through the po rtrait hole?” 
“Ask him!” said Ron, pointing a shaking finger at the back of Sir 
Cadogan’s picture. “Ask him if he saw —” 
Glaring suspiciously at Ron, Professor McGonagall pushed the 
portrait back open and went ou tside. The whole common room 
listened with bated breath.

“Certainly, good lady!” cried Sir Cadogan.

“He had ’em!” said Sir Cadogan proudly. “Had the whole

“Which person,” she said, her vo ice shaking, “which abysmally

Black had been caught. Professor McGonagall came back at dawn, 
to tell them that he had again escaped. 
Throughout the day, everywhere they went they saw signs of 
tighter security; Professor Flitwick could be seen teaching the front 
doors to recognize a large picture of Sirius Black; Filch was sud-
denly bustling up and down the co rridors, boarding up everything 
from tiny cracks in the walls to mouse holes. Sir Cadogan had been 
fired. His portrait had been taken back to its lonely landing on the 
seventh floor, and the Fat Lady was back. She had been expertly 
restored, but was still extremely ne rvous, and had agreed to return 
to her job only on condition that she was given extra protection. A 
bunch of surly security trolls had been hired to guard her. They

 270  paced the corridor in a menacing group, talking in grunts and 
comparing the size of their clubs. 
Harry couldn’t help noticing that the statue of the one-eyed 
witch on the third floor remained unguarded and unblocked. It seemed that Fred and George ha d been right in thinking that 
they — and now Harry, Ron, and Hermione — were the only 
ones who knew about the hidden passageway within it. 
“D’you reckon we should tell someone?” Harry asked Ron. “We know he’s not coming in through Honeyduke’s,” said Ron 
dismissively “We’d’ve heard if th e shop had been broken into.” 
Harry was glad Ron took this vi ew. If the one-eyed witch was 
boarded up too, he would never be able to go into Hogsmeade 
again. 
Ron had become an instant celebr ity. For the first time in his 
life, people were paying more attention to him than to Harry, and it was clear that Ron was rather enjoying the experience. Though 
still severely shaken by the night’s events, he was happy to tell any-
one who asked what had happened , with a wealth of detail. 
“. . . I was asleep, and I heard th is ripping noise, and I thought 
it was in my dream, you know? But then there was this draft . . . I 
woke up and one side of the hang ings on my bed had been pulled 
down. . . . I rolled over . . . and I saw him standing over me . . . 
like a skeleton, with loads of filthy hair . . . holding this great long 
knife, must’ve been twelve inches . . . and he looked at me, and I 
looked at him, and th en I yelled, and he scampered. 
“Why, though?” Ron added to Harry as the group of second-
year girls who had been listening to his chilling tale departed. 
“Why did he run?” 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 271  Harry had been wondering the sa me thing. Why had Black, 
having got the wrong bed, not silenced Ron and proceeded to 
Harry? Black had proved twelve year s ago that he didn’t mind mur-
dering innocent people, and this time he had been facing five un-
armed boys, four of whom were asleep. 
“He must’ve known he’d have a job getting back out of the castle 
once you’d yelled and woken people up,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He’d’ve had to kill the whole House to get back through the por-
trait hole . . . then he woul d’ve met the teachers. . . .” 
Neville was in total disgrace. Professor McGonagall was so furi-
ous with him she had banned him from all future Hogsmeade vis-its, given him a detention, and forbidden anyone to give him the 
password into the tower. Poor Nevi lle was forced to wait outside 
the common room every night for somebody to let him in, while 
the security trolls leered unplea santly at him. None of these pun-
ishments, however, came close to matching th e one his grand-
mother had in store for him. Two days after Black’s break-in, she 
sent Neville the very worst thing a Hogwarts student could receive 
over breakfast — a Howler. 
The school owls swooped into th e Great Hall carrying the mail 
as usual, and Neville choked as a huge barn owl landed in front 
of him, a scarlet envelope clutched in its beak. Harry and Ron, 
who were sitting opposite him, reco gnized the letter as a Howler at 
once — Ron had got one from his mother the year before. 
“Run for it, Neville,” Ron advised. Neville didn’t need telling twic e. He seized the envelope, and 
holding it before him like a bomb , sprinted out of the hall, while 
the Slytherin table exploded with laug hter at the sight of him. They 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 272  heard the Howler go off in the entrance hall — Neville’s grand-
mother’s voice, magically magnified to a hundred times its usual 
volume, shrieking about how he had brought shame on the whole 
family. 
Harry was too busy fe eling sorry for Neville to notice immedi-
ately that he had a letter too. He dwig got his attention by nipping 
him sharply on the wrist. 
“Ouch! Oh — thanks, Hedwig.” Harry tore open the envelope whil e Hedwig helped herself to 
some of Neville’s cornflak es. The note inside said: 
 
Dear Harry and Ron, 
How about having tea with me this afternoon ’round six? I’ll come and collect you from the castle. WAIT FOR ME IN THE ENTRANCE HALL; YOU’RE NOT ALLOWED OUT ON YOUR OWN. Cheers, 
Hagrid 
 
“He probably wants to hear all about Black!” said Ron. 
So at six o’clock that afternoon, Harry and Ron left Gryffindor 
Tower, passed the security trolls at a run, and headed down to the 
entrance hall. 
Hagrid was already waiting for them. 
“All right, Hagrid!” said Ron. “S’pose you want to hear about 
Saturday night, do you?” 
“I’ve already heard all abou’ it,” said Hagrid, opening the front 
doors and leading them outside. 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 273  “Oh,” said Ron, looking slightly put out. 
The first thing they saw on entering Hagrid’s cabin was Buck-
beak, who was stretched out on to p of Hagrid’s patchwork quilt, 
his enormous wings folded tight to his body, enjoying a large 
plate of dead ferrets. Averting his eyes from this unpleasant 
sight, Harry saw a gigantic, hairy brown suit and a very horrible 
yellow-and-orange tie hanging from the top of Hagrid’s wardrobe 
door. 
“What are they for, Hagrid?” said Harry. 
“Buckbeak’s case against the Committee fer the Disposal o’ Dan-
gerous Creatures,” said Hagrid. “This Friday. Him an’ me’ll be 
goin’ down ter London together. I’ve booked two beds on the Knight Bus. . . .” 
Harry felt a nasty pang of guilt. He had completely forgotten 
that Buckbeak’s trial was so near , and judging by the uneasy look 
on Ron’s face, he had too. They had also forgotten their promise 
about helping him prepare Buckbeak ’s defense; the arrival of the 
Firebolt had driven it cl ean out of their minds. 
Hagrid poured them tea and offered them a plate of Bath buns, 
but they knew better than to ac cept; they had had too much expe-
rience with Hagrid’s cooking. 
“I got somethin’ ter discuss with you two,” said Hagrid, sitting 
himself between them and looking uncharacteristically serious. 
“What?” said Harry. 
“Hermione,” said Hagrid. 
“What about her?” said Ron. 
“She’s in a righ’ state, that’s wh at. She’s bin comin’ down ter visit 
me a lot since Chris’mas. Bin feelin’ lonely. Firs’ yeh weren’ talking 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 274  to her because o’ the Firebolt, now yer not talkin’ to her because her 
cat —” 
“— ate Scabbers!” Ron interjected angrily. 
“Because her cat acted like all cats do,” Hagrid continued 
doggedly. “She’s cried a fair few times, yeh know. Goin’ through a rough time at the moment. Bitten off more’n she can chew, if yeh ask me, all the work she’s tryin’ ter do. Still found time 
ter help me with Buckbeak’s ca se, mind. . . . She’s found some 
really good stuff fer me . . . reckon he’ll stand a good chance 
now. . . .” 
“Hagrid, we should’ve helped as well — sorry —” Harry began 
awkwardly. 
“I’m not blamin’ yeh!” said Ha grid, waving Harry’s apology 
aside. “Gawd knows yeh’ve had enou gh ter be gettin’ on with. I’ve 
seen yeh practicin’ Quidditch ev’ry hour o’ the day an’ night — but 
I gotta tell yeh, I thought you two’d value yer friend more’n broom-sticks or rats. Tha’s all.” 
Harry and Ron exchanged uncomfortable looks. 
“Really upset, she was, when Black nearly stabbed yeh, Ron. 
She’s got her heart in the right pl ace, Hermione has, an’ you two 
not talkin’ to her —” 
“If she’d just get rid of that cat, I’d speak to her again!” Ron said 
angrily. “But she’s still sticking up for it! It’s a maniac, and she won’t hear a word against it!” 
“Ah, well, people can be a bit stupid abou’ their pets,” said Ha-
grid wisely. Behind him, Buckbeak spat a few ferret bones onto Hagrid’s pillow. 
They spent the rest of their visit discussing Gryffindor’s 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 275  improved chances for the Quidditch Cup. At nine o’clock, Hagrid 
walked them back up to the castle. 
A large group of people was bunc hed around the bulletin board 
when they returned to the common room. 
“Hogsmeade, next weekend!” said Ron, craning over the heads 
to read the new notice. “What d’yo u reckon?” he added quietly to 
Harry as they went to sit down. 
“Well, Filch hasn’t done anythi ng about the passage into Hon-
eydukes. . . .” Harry sa id, even more quietly. 
“Harry!” said a voice in his right ear. Harry started and looked 
around at Hermione, who was sitt ing at the table right behind 
them and clearing a space in the wall of books that had been hid-ing her. 
“Harry, if you go into Hogsmead e again . . . I’ll tell Professor 
McGonagall about that map!” said Hermione. 
“Can you hear someone talking, Harry?” growled Ron, not 
looking at Hermione. 
“Ron, how can you let him go with you? After what Sirius Black 
nearly did to you! I mean it, I’ ll tell —” 
“So now you’re trying to get Harry expelled!” said Ron furiously. 
“Haven’t you done enough damage this year?” 
Hermione opened her mouth to respond, but with a soft hiss, 
Crookshanks leapt onto her lap. Hermione took one frightened 
look at the expression on Ron’s face, gathered up Crookshanks, and 
hurried away toward the girls’ dormitories. 
“So how about it?” Ron said to Harry as though there had been 
no interruption. “Come on, last time we went you didn’t see any-thing. You haven’t even be en inside Zonko’s yet!” 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 276  Harry looked around to check that Hermione was well out of 
earshot. 
“Okay,” he said. “But I’m taking the Invisibility Cloak this time.” 
 
On Saturday morning, Harry packed his Invisibility Cloak in his 
bag, slipped the Marauder’s Map into his pocket , and went down 
to breakfast with everyone else. Hermione kept shooting suspicious 
looks down the table at him, but he avoided her eye and was care-ful to let her see him walking back up the marble staircase in the 
entrance hall as everybody else proceeded to the front doors. 
“ ’Bye!” Harry called to Ron. “S ee you when you get back!” 
Ron grinned and winked. 
Harry hurried up to the third floo r, slipping the Marauder’s Map 
out of his pocket as he went. Crouching behind the one-eyed 
witch, he smoothed it out. A tiny dot was moving in his direction. 
Harry squinted at it. The minuscule writing next to it read Neville 
Longbottom. 
Harry quickly pulled out his wand, muttered, “ Dissendium !” 
and shoved his bag into the statue, but before he could climb in 
himself, Neville came around the corner. 
“Harry! I forgot you weren’t going to Hogsmeade either!” 
“Hi, Neville,” said Harry, moving swiftly away from the statue 
and pushing the map back into his pocket. “What are you up to?” 
“Nothing,” shrugged Neville. “Want a game of Exploding Snap?” “Er — not now — I was going to go to the library and do that 
vampire essay for Lupin —” 
“I’ll come with you!” said Neville brightly. “I haven’t done it 
either!” 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 277  “Er — hang on — yeah , I forgot, I finished it last night!” 
“Great, you can help me!” said Neville, his round face anxious. 
“I don’t understand th at thing about the garl ic at all — do they 
have to eat it, or —” 
He broke off with a small gasp, looking over Harry’s shoulder. 
It was Snape. Neville took a quick step be hind Harry. 
“And what are you two doing here?” said Snape, coming to a halt 
and looking from one to the other. “An odd place to meet —” 
To Harry’s immense disquiet, Snap e’s black eyes flicked to the 
doorways on either side of them, and then to the one-eyed witch. 
“We’re not — meeting here,” said Harry. “We just — met 
here.” 
“Indeed?” said Snape. “You have a habit of turning up in unex-
pected places, Potter, and you are very rarely there for no good rea-
son. . . . I suggest the pair of you return to Gryffindor Tower, where you belong.” 
Harry and Neville set off without another word. As they turned 
the corner, Harry looked back. Sn ape was running one of his hands 
over the one-eyed witch’s head, examining it closely. 
Harry managed to shake Neville off at the Fat Lady by tell-
ing him the password, then pretending he’d left his vampire essay in the library and doubling back. Once out of sight of the secu-
rity trolls, he pulled out the map again and held it close to his 
nose. 
The third floor corrid or seemed to be de serted. Harry scanned 
the map carefully and saw, with a le ap of relief, th at the tiny dot 
labeled Severus Snape was now back in its office. 
He sprinted back to the one-eyed witch, opened her hump, 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 278  heaved himself inside, and slid dow n to meet his bag at the bottom 
of the stone chute. He wiped th e Marauder’s Map blank again, 
then set off at a run. 
 
Harry, completely hidden beneath the Invisibility Cloak, emerged 
into the sunlight outside Hone ydukes and prodded Ron in the 
back. 
“It’s me,” he muttered. 
“What kept you?” Ron hissed. 
“Snape was hangin g around. . . .” 
They set off up the High Street. 
“Where are you?” Ron kept muttering out of the corner of his 
mouth. “Are you still there? This feels weird. . . .” 
They went to the post office; Ro n pretended to be checking the 
price of an owl to Bill in Egypt so that Harry could have a good 
look around. The owls sat hooting so ftly down at him, at least three 
hundred of them; from Great Grays right down to tiny little Scops 
owls (“Local Deliveries Only”), which were so small they could 
have sat in the palm of Harry’s hand. 
Then they visited Zonko’s, which was so packed with students 
Harry had to exercise great care no t to tread on anyone and cause a 
panic. There were jokes and tricks to fulfill even Fred’s and George’s 
wildest dreams; Harry gave Ron whispered orders and passed him 
some gold from under the cloak. They left Zonko’s with their 
money bags considerably lighter th an they had been on entering, 
but their pockets bulging with Dungbombs, Hiccup Sweets, Frog 
Spawn Soap, and a Nose-Biting Teacup apiece. 
The day was fine and breezy, and ne ither of them felt like stay-
ing indoors, so they walked pa st the Three Br oomsticks and 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 279  climbed a slope to visit the Shri eking Shack, the most haunted 
dwelling in Britain. It stood a little way above the rest of the village, 
and even in daylight was slightly creepy, with its boarded windows 
and dank overgrown garden. 
“Even the Hogwarts ghosts avoid it ,” said Ron as they leaned on 
the fence, looking up at it. “I asked Nearly Headless Nick . . . he says 
he’s heard a very rough crowd lives here. No one can get in. Fred and 
George tried, obviously, but all the entrances are sealed shut. . . .” 
Harry, feeling hot from their clim b, was just considering taking 
off the cloak for a few minutes when they heard voices nearby. 
Someone was climbing toward the house from the other side of the hill; moments later, Malfoy had appeared, followed closely by 
Crabbe and Goyle. Ma lfoy was speaking. 
“. . . should have an owl from Father any time now. He had to 
go to the hearing to tell them about my arm . . . about how I 
couldn’t use it for three months. . . .” 
Crabbe and Goyle sniggered. 
“I really wish I could hear that great hairy moro n trying to de-
fend himself . . . ‘There’s no ’arm in ’im, ’onest —’ . . . that hip-
pogriff’s as good as dead —” 
Malfoy suddenly caught sight of Ron. His pale face split in a 
malevolent grin. 
“What are you doing, Weasley?” 
Malfoy looked up at the cr umbling house behind Ron. 
“Suppose you’d love to live here, wouldn’t you, Weasley? Dream-
ing about having your own bedroom? I heard your family all sleep in one room — is that true?” 
Harry seized the back of Ron’s robe s to stop him from leaping on 
Malfoy. 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 280  “Leave him to me,” he hissed in Ron’s ear. 
The opportunity was too perfect to miss. Harry crept silently 
around behind Malfoy, Crabbe , and Goyle, bent down, and 
scooped a large handful of mud out of the path. 
“We were just discussing your friend Hagrid,” Malfoy said to 
Ron. “Just trying to imagine what he’s saying to the Committee for 
the Disposal of Dangerous Creatu res. D’you think he’ll cry when 
they cut off his hippogriff’s —” 
SPLAT. Malfoy’s head jerked forward as the mud hit him; his silver-
blond hair was suddenly dripping in muck. 
“What the — ?” Ron had to hold onto the fence to keep himself standing, he was 
laughing so hard. Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle spun stupidly on the spot, staring wildly around, Malfoy trying to wipe his hair clean. 
“What was that? Who did that?” 
“Very haunted up here, isn’t it?” said Ron, with the air of one 
commenting on the weather. 
Crabbe and Goyle were looking scared. Their bulging muscles 
were no use against ghosts. Malfoy was staring madly around at the 
deserted landscape. 
Harry sneaked along the path, where a particularly sloppy 
puddle yielded some foul-smelling, green sludge. 
SPLATTER. 
Crabbe and Goyle caught some this time. Goyle hopped furi-
ously on the spot, trying to rub it out of his small, dull eyes. 
“It came from over there!” said Malfoy, wiping his face, and star-
ing at a spot some six feet to the left of Harry. 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 281  Crabbe blundered forward, his lo ng arms outstretched like a 
zombie. Harry dodged around him, picked up a stick, and lobbed 
it at Crabbe’s back. Harry doubled up with silent laughter as 
Crabbe did a kind of pirouette in midair, trying to see who had 
thrown it. As Ron was the only person Crabbe could see, it was 
Ron he started toward, but Harry stuck out his leg. Crabbe stum-
bled — and his huge, flat foot ca ught the hem of Harry’s cloak. 
Harry felt a great tug, then the cloak slid off his face. 
For a split second, Malfoy stared at him. 
“AAARGH!” he yelled, pointing at Harry’s head. Then he 
turned tail and ran, at breakneck speed, back down the hill, Crabbe 
and Goyle behind him. 
Harry tugged the cloak up agai n, but the damage was done. 
“Harry!” Ron said, stumbling forward and staring hopelessly at 
the point where Harry had disappeared, “you’d better run for it! If 
Malfoy tells anyone — you’d better get back to the castle, quick —” 
“See you later,” said Harry, and without another word, he tore 
back down the path toward Hogsmeade. 
Would Malfoy believe what he had seen? Would anyone believe 
Malfoy? Nobody knew about the In visibility Cloak — nobody ex-
cept Dumbledore. Harry’s stom ach turned over — Dumbledore 
would know exactly what had ha ppened, if Malfoy said any-
thing — 
Back into Honeydukes, back dow n the cellar steps, across the 
stone floor, through the trapdoor — Harry pulled off the cloak, 
tucked it under his arm, and ran, flat out, along the passage. . . . 
Malfoy would get back first . . . ho w long would it take him to find 
a teacher? Panting, a sharp pain in his side, Harry didn’t slow down 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 282  until he reached the stone slide. He would have to leave the cloak 
w h e r e i t w a s , i t w a s t o o m u c h o f a g i v e a w a y i n c a s e M a l f o y h a d 
tipped off a teacher — he hid it in a shadowy corner, then started 
to climb, fast as he could, his sw eaty hands slipping on the sides of 
the chute. He reached the inside of the witch’s hump, tapped it 
with his wand, stuck his head thro ugh, and hoisted himself out; the 
hump closed, and just as Harry jumped out from behind the 
statue, he heard quick footsteps approaching. 
It was Snape. He approached Harry at a swift walk, his black 
robes swishing, then st opped in fr ont of him. 
“So,” he said. 
There was a look of suppressed triumph about him. Harry tried 
to look innocent, all too aware of his sweaty face and his muddy hands, which he quickl y hid in his pockets. 
“Come with me, Pott er,” said Snape. 
Harry followed him downstairs, t rying to wipe his hands clean 
on the inside of his robes with out Snape notici ng. They walked 
down the stairs to the dungeons and then into Snape’s office. 
Harry had been in here only once before, and he had been in 
very serious trouble then too. Snap e had acquired a few more slimy 
horrible things in jars since last time, all standing on shelves behind 
his desk, glinting in the fireligh t and adding to the threatening 
atmosphere. 
“Sit,” said Snape. Harry sat. Snape, howeve r, remained standing. 
“Mr. Malfoy has just been to see me with a strange story, Potter,” 
said Snape. 
Harry didn’t say anything. 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 283  “He tells me that he was up by the Shrieking Shack when he ran 
into Weasley — ap parently alone.” 
Still, Harry didn’t speak. 
“Mr. Malfoy states that he wa s standing talking to Weasley, 
when a large amount of mud hit hi m in the back of the head. How 
do you think that coul d have happened?” 
Harry tried to look mildly surprised. 
“I don’t know, Professor.” Snape’s eyes were boring into Ha rry’s. It was exactly like trying 
to stare down a hippogriff. Ha rry tried hard not to blink. 
“Mr. Malfoy then saw an extr aordinary apparition. Can you 
imagine what it might have been, Potter?” 
“No,” said Harry, now trying to sound innocently curious. 
“It was your head, Potter. Floating in midair.” 
There was a long silence. 
“Maybe he’d better go to Mada m Pomfrey,” said Harry. “If he’s 
seeing things like —” 
“What would your head have be en doing in Hogsmeade, Pot-
ter?” said Snape softly. “Your head is not allowed in Hogsmeade. 
No part of your body has perm ission to be in Hogsmeade.” 
“I know that,” said Harry, striving to keep his face free of guilt 
or fear. “It sounds like Ma lfoy’s having hallucin —” 
“Malfoy is not having hallucinat ions,” snarled Snape, and he 
bent down, a hand on each arm of Harry’s chair, so that their faces 
were a foot apart. “If your head was in Hogsmeade, so was the rest 
of you.” 
“I’ve been up in Gryffindor Tower,” said Harry. “Like you 
told —” 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 284  “Can anyone confirm that?” 
Harry didn’t say anything. Snape’s thin mouth curled into a hor-
rible smile. 
“So,” he said, straightening up again. “Everyone from the Min-
ister of Magic downward has been trying to keep famous Harry 
Potter safe from Sirius Black. Bu t famous Harry Potter is a law 
unto himself. Let the ordinary pe ople worry about his safety! Fa-
mous Harry Potter goes where he wa nts to, with no thought for the 
consequences.” 
Harry stayed silent. Snape was tryi ng to provoke him into telling 
the truth. He wasn’t going to do it. Snape had no proof — yet. 
“How extraordinarily like your father you are, Potter,” Snape 
said suddenly, his eyes glinting. “He too was exceedingly arrogant. 
A small amount of talent on the Quidditch field made him think 
he was a cut above the rest of us too. Strutting around the place 
with his friends and admirers . . . The resemblance between you is 
uncanny.” 
“My dad didn’t strut, ” said Harry, before he could stop himself. 
“And neither do I.” 
“Your father didn’t set much store by rules either,” Snape went 
on, pressing his advantage, his thin face full of malice. “Rules were 
for lesser mortals, not Quidditch Cup-winners. His head was so swollen —” 
“SHUT UP!” 
Harry was suddenly on his feet. Ra g e s u c h a s h e h a d n o t f e l t 
since his last night in Privet Dr ive was coursing through him. He 
didn’t care that Snape’s face had gone rigid, the black eyes flashing dangerously. 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 285  “What did you say to me, Potter ?” 
“I told you to shut up about my dad!” Harry yelled. “I know the 
truth, all right? He saved your life! Dumbledore told me! You 
wouldn’t even be here if it wasn’t for my dad!” 
Snape’s sallow skin had gone the color of sour milk. 
“And did the headmaster tell yo u the circumstances in which 
your father saved my life?” he wh ispered. “Or did he consider the 
details too unpleasant for prec ious Potter’s delicate ears?” 
Harry bit his lip. He didn’t kn ow what had happened and didn’t 
want to admit it — but Snape seem ed to have guessed the truth. 
“I would hate for you to run away with a false idea of your fa-
ther, Potter,” he said, a terrible grin twisting his face. “Have you 
been imagining some act of glorio us heroism? Then let me correct 
you — your saintly father and his friends played a highly amusing

about what he did. He was saving his own skin as much as mine. 
Had their joke succeeded, he woul d have been expelled from Hog-

Snape’s uneven, yellowis h teeth were bared. 
“Turn out your pockets, Po tter!” he spat suddenly. 
Harry didn’t move. There wa s a pounding in his ears. 
“ T u r n o u t y o u r p o c k e t s , o r w e g o s t r a i g h t t o t h e h e a d m a s t e r ! 
Pull them out, Potter!” 
Cold with dread, Harry slowly pulled out the bag of Zonko’s 
tricks and the Marauder’s Map. 
Snap picked up the Zonko’s bag. “Ron gave them to me,” said Harry, praying he’d get a chance to 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 286  tip Ron off before Snape saw him. “He — brought them back 
from Hogsmeade last time —” 
“Indeed? And you’ve been carrying them around ever since? 
How very touching . . . and what is this?” 
Snape had picked up the map. Ha rry tried with all his might to 
keep his face impassive. 
“Spare bit of parchment,” he said with a shrug. 
Snape turned it over, his eyes on Harry. 
“Surely you don’t need such a very old piece of parchment?” he 
said. “Why don’t I just — throw this away?” 
His hand moved toward the fire. 
“No!” Harry said quickly. 
“So!” said Snape, his long nostri ls quivering. “Is this another 
treasured gift from Mr. Weasley? Or is it — something else? A let-ter, perhaps, written in invisible in k? Or — instructions to get into 
Hogsmeade without passi ng the dementors?” 
Harry blinked. Snape’s eyes gleamed. “Let me see, let me see . . . ,” he muttered, taking out his wand 
and smoothing the map out on his de sk. “Reveal your secret!” he 
said, touching the wand to the parchment. 
Nothing happened. Harry clenched his hands to stop them from 
shaking. 
“Show yourself!” Snape said , tapping the map sharply. 
It stayed blank. Harry was taking deep, calming breaths. 
“Professor Severus Snape, master of this school, commands you 
to yield the information you conceal!” Snape said, hitting the map with his wand. 
As though an invisible hand were writing upon it, words ap-
peared on the smooth surface of the map.

Snape froze. Harry stared, dumbst ruck, at the message. But the 
map didn’t stop there. More writing was appearing beneath the 
first. 
ÀMr. Prongs agrees with Mr. Moony, and would like to add that Professor 
Snape is an ugly git.Ã 
It would have been very funny if the situation hadn’t been so se-
rious. And there was more. . . . 
“Mr. Padfoot would like to register his astonishm ent that an idiot like that 
ever became a professor.” 
Harry closed his eyes in horror. When he’d opened them, the 
map had had its last word. 
“Mr. Wormtail bids, Professor Snape good day, and advises 
him to wash his ha ir, the slimeball.” 
Harry waited for the blow to fall. 
“So . . . ,” said Snape softly. “We’ll see abou t this. . . .” 
He strode across to his fire, seized a fistful of glittering powder 
from a jar on the fi replace, and threw it into the flames. 
“Lupin!” Snape called into the fire. “I want a word!” 
Utterly bewildered, Harry stared at the fire. A large shape had 
appeared in it, revolving very fast . Seconds later, Professor Lupin 
was clambering out of the fireplac e, brushing ash off his shabby 
robes. 
“You called, Severus?” said Lupin mildly. “I certainly did,” said Snape, his face contorted with fury as he 
strode back to his desk. “I have just asked Potter to empty his pock-
ets. He was carrying this.” 
Snape pointed at the parchment, on which the words of Messrs. 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 288  Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Pron gs were still shining. An odd, 
closed expression appeared on Lupin’s face. 
“Well?” said Snape. 
Lupin continued to stare at th e map. Harry had the impression 
that Lupin was doing some very quick thinking. 
“Well?” said Snape again. “This parchment is plainly full of Dark 
Magic. This is supposed to be your area of expertise, Lupin. Where 
do you imagine Potter got such a thing?” 
Lupin looked up and, by the me rest half-glance in Harry’s direc-
tion, warned him not to interrupt. 
“Full of Dark Magic?” he repeat ed mildly. “Do you really think 
so, Severus? It looks to me as though it is merely a piece of parch-ment that insults anybody who re ads it. Childish, but surely not 
dangerous? I imagine Harry go t it from a joke shop —” 
“Indeed?” said Snape. His jaw ha d gone rigid with anger. “You 
think a joke shop could supply him with such a thing? You 
don’t think it more likely that he got it directly from the manufac-
turers ?” 
Harry didn’t understand what Snap e was talking about. Nor, ap-
parently, did Lupin. 
“You mean, by Mr. Wormtail or one of these people?” he said. 
“Harry, do you know any of these men?” 
“No,” said Harry quickly. 
“You see, Severus?” said Lupin, turning back to Snape. “It looks 
like a Zonko product to me —” 
Right on cue, Ron came bursting into the office. He was com-
pletely out of breath, and stoppe d just short of Snape’s desk, 
clutching the stitch in his chest and trying to speak. 
 
SNAPE’S GRUDGE 
 289  “I — gave — Harry — that — stuff,” he choked. “Bought — 
it . . . in Zonko’s . . . ages — ago . . .” 
“Well!” said Lupin, clapping his hands together and looking 
around cheerfully. “That seems to cl ear that up! Severus, I’ll take 
this back, shall I?” He folded th e map and tucked it inside his 
robes. “Harry, Ron, come with me, I need a word about my vam-
pire essay — excuse us, Severus —” 
Harry didn’t dare look at Snape as they left his office. He, Ron, 
and Lupin walked all the way back into the entrance hall before 
speaking. Then Harry turned to Lupin. 
“Professor, I —” 
“I don’t want to hear explanat ions,” said Lupin shortly. He 
glanced around the empty entrance hall and lowered his voice. “I 
happen to know that this map wa s confiscated by Mr. Filch many 
years ago. Yes, I know it’s a map,” he said as Harry and Ron looked amazed. “I don’t want to know ho w it fell into your possession. I 
am, however, astounded that you didn’t hand it in. Particularly after 
what happened the last time a st udent left information about the 
castle lying around. And I can’t let you have it back, Harry.” 
Harry had expected that, and was too keen for explanations to 
protest. 
“Why did Snape thin k I’d got it from the manufacturers?” 
“Because . . . ,” Lupin hesita ted, “because these mapmakers 
would have wanted to lure you out of school. They’ d think it ex-tremely entertaining.” 
“Do you know them?” said Ha rry, impressed. 
“We’ve met,” he said shortly. He was looking at Harry more 
seriously than ever before. 
 
CHAPTER FOURTEEN 
 290  “Don’t expect me to cover up for you again, Harry. I cannot 
make you take Sirius Black seri ously. But I would have thought 
that what you have heard when the dement ors draw near you 
would have had more of an effect on you. Yo ur parents gave their 
lives to keep you alive, Harry. A poor way to repay them — gam-
bling their sacrifice for a bag of magic tricks.” 
He walked away, leaving Harry feel ing worse by far than he had 
at any point in Snape’s office. Slowly, he and Ron mounted the 
marble staircase. As Harry passed the one-eyed witch, he remem-
bered the Invisibility Cloak — it wa s still down there, but he didn’t 
dare go and get it. 
“It’s my fault,” said Ron abru ptly. “I persuaded you to go. 
Lupin’s right, it was stupid, we shouldn’t’ve done it —” 
He broke off; they reached the corridor where the security trolls 
were pacing, and Hermione was walk ing toward them. One look at 
her face convinced Harry that sh e had heard what had happened. 
His heart plummeted — had she told Professor McGonagall? 
“Come to have a good gloat?” said Ron savagely as she stopped 
in front of them. “Or have yo u just been to tell on us?” 
“No,” said Hermione. She was hold ing a letter in her hands and 
her lip was trembling. “I just thought you ought to know . . . 
Hagrid lost his case. Buckbeak is going to be executed.”

Harry took it. The parchment was damp, and enormous tear-
drops had smudged the ink so badly in places that it was very diffi-
cult to read. 
Dear Hermione, 
We lost. I’m allowed to bring him back to Hogwarts. Execution date to be fixed. Beaky has enjoyed London.

of doddery old fools, and they were scared. There’ll be an appeal, 
though, there always is. Only I can’ t see any hope. . . . Nothing will 
have changed.” 
“Yeah, it will,” said Ron fiercely. “You won’t have to do all the 
work alone this time, Hermione. I’ll help.” 
“Oh, Ron!” Hermione flung her arms arou nd Ron’s neck and broke down 
completely. Ron, looking quite terrified, patted her very awkwardly on the top of the head. Finally, Hermione drew away. 
“Ron, I’m really, really sorry abou t Scabbers . . . ,” she sobbed. 
“Oh — well — he was old,” said Ron, looking thoroughly re-
lieved that she had let go of him. “And he was a bit useless. You 
never know, Mum and Dad might get me an owl now.” 
 
The safety measures imposed on the students since Black’s second 
break-in made it impossible for Harry, Ron, and Hermione to go 
and visit Hagrid in the evenings. Their only chance of talking to 
him was during Care of Ma gical Creatures lessons. 
He seemed numb with shock at the verdict. 
“S’all my fault. Got all tongue-tie d. They was all sittin’ there in 
black robes an’ I kep’ droppin’ me notes and forgettin’ all them

THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 293  They were walking back up to the castle with the rest of the 
class. Ahead they could see Malf oy, who was walking with Crabbe 
and Goyle, and kept looking back, laughing derisively. 
“S’no good, Ron,” said Hagrid sa dly as they reached the castle 
steps. “That Committee’s in Lucius Malfoy’s pocket. I’m jus’ gonna 
make sure the rest o’ Beaky’s time is the happiest he’s ever had. I 
owe him that. . . .” 
Hagrid turned around and hurried back toward his cabin, his 
face buried in his handkerchief. 
“Look at him blubber!” 
Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle had been standing just inside the 
castle doors, listening. 
“Have you ever seen anything quite as pathetic?” said Malfoy. 
“And he’s supposed to be our teacher!” 
Harry and Ron both made furiou s moves toward Malfoy, but 
Hermione got there first — SMACK! 
She had slapped Malfoy across the face with all the strength she 
could muster. Malfoy staggered. Harry, Ron, Crabbe, and Goyle 
stood flabbergasted as Hermione raised her hand again. 
“Don’t you dare call Hagrid pathetic, you foul — you evil —” 
“Hermione!” said Ron weakly, and he tried to grab her hand as 
she swung it back. 
“Get off, Ron!” 
Hermione pulled out her wand . Malfoy stepped backward. 
Crabbe and Goyle looked at him for instructions, thoroughly be-
wildered. 
“C’mon,” Malfoy muttered, and in a moment, all three of them 
had disappeared into the pa ssageway to the dungeons.

pressed. 
“Harry, you’d better beat him in the Quidditch final!” Hermione 
said shrilly. “You just better had, because I can’t stand it if Slytherin 
wins!” 
“We’re due in Charms,” said Ron, still goggling at Hermione. 
“We’d better go.” 
They hurried up the marble stairc ase toward Professor Flitwick’s 
classroom. 
“You’re late, boys!” said Professor Flitwick reprovingly as Harry 
opened the classroom door. “Come along, quickly, wands out, 
we’re experimenting with Cheerin g Charms today, we’ve already 
divided into pairs —” 
Harry and Ron hurried to a desk at the back and opened their 
bags. Ron looked behind him. 
“Where’s Hermione gone?” 
Harry looked around too. Hermione hadn’t entered the class-
room, yet Harry knew she had been right next to him when he had 
opened the door. 
“That’s weird,” said Harry, staring at Ron. “Maybe — maybe 
she went to the bath room or something?” 
But Hermione didn’t turn up all lesson. 
“She could’ve done wi th a Cheering Charm on her too,” said 
Ron as the class left for lunch, all grinning broadly — the Cheer-
ing Charms had left them with a feeling of great contentment. 
Hermione wasn’t at lunch either. By the time they had finished 
their apple pie, the after-effects of the Cheering Charms were wear-
ing off, and Harry and Ron had st arted to get slightly worried. 
 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 295  “You don’t think Malfoy did so mething to her?” Ron said anx-
iously as they hurried upstairs toward Gryffindor Tower. 
They passed the security trolls, gave the Fat Lady the password 
(“Flibbertigibbet”), and scrambled through the portra it hole into 
the common room. 
Hermione was sitting at a table, fast asleep , her head resting on 
an open Arithmancy book. They went to sit down on either side of 
her. Harry prodded her awake. 
“Wh — what?” said Hermione, wa king with a start and staring 
wildly around. “Is it time to go? W — which lesson have we got 
now? 
“Divination, but it’s not for another twenty minutes,” said 
Harry. “Hermione, why didn ’t you come to Charms?” 
“ W h a t ? O h n o ! ” H e r m i o n e s q u e a k e d . “ I f o r g o t t o g o t o

“But how could you forget?” said Harry. “You were with us till 
we were right outside the classroom!” 
“I don’t believe it!” Hermione wa iled. “Was Professor Flitwick 
angry? Oh, it was Malfoy, I was thinking about him and I lost track 
of things!” 
“You know what, Hermione?” sa id Ron, looking down at the 
enormous Arithmancy book Hermio ne had been using as a pillow. 
“I reckon you’re cracking up. You’re trying to do too much.” 
“No, I’m not!” said Hermione, brushing her hair out of her eyes 
and staring hopelessly around for her bag. “I just made a mistake, 
that’s all! I’d better go and see Pr ofessor Flitwick and say sorry. . . . 
I’ll see you in Divination!” 
Hermione joined them at the foot of the ladder to Professor 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 296  Trelawney’s classroom twenty minutes later, looking extremely har-
assed. 
“I can’t believe I missed Cheerin g Charms! And I bet they come 
up in our exams; Professor Fl itwick hinted they might!” 
Together they climbed the ladder into the dim, stifling tower 
room. Glowing on every little table was a crystal ball full of pearly 
white mist. Harry, Ron, and Herm ione sat down together at the 
same rickety table. 
“I thought we weren’t starting crystal balls until next term,” Ron 
muttered, casting a wary eye around for Professor Trelawney, in 
case she was lu rking nearby. 
“Don’t complain, this means we’ve finished palmistry,” Harry 
muttered back. “I was getting sick of her flinching every time she 
looked at my hands.” 
“Good day to you!” said the famili ar, misty voice, and Professor 
Trelawney made her usual dramatic entrance out of the shadows. 
Parvati and Lavender quivered with excitement, their faces lit by 
the milky glow of their crystal ball. 
“I have decided to introduce the crystal ball a little earlier than I 
had planned,” said Professor Trelaw ney, sitting with her back to the 
fire and gazing around. “The fates have informed me that your ex-
amination in June will concern the Orb, and I am anxious to give 
you sufficient practice.” 
Hermione snorted. “Well, honestly . . . ‘the fates ha ve informed her’ . . . who sets 
the exam? She does! What an amaz ing prediction!” she said, not 
troubling to keep her voice lo w. Harry and Ron choked back 
laughs. 
It was hard to tell whether Professor Trelawney had heard them, 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 297  as her face was hidden in shadow. She continued, however, as 
though she had not. 
“Crystal gazing is a particularly r efined art,” she said dreamily. “I 
do not expect any of you to See when first you peer into the Orb’s infinite depths. We shall start by practicing relaxing the conscious 
mind and external eyes” — Ron be gan to snigger uncontrollably 
and had to stuff his fist in his mout h to stifle the noise — “so as to 
clear the Inner Eye and the superc onscious. Perhaps, if we are 
lucky, some of you will See before the end of the class.” 
And so they began. Harry, at least, felt extremely foolish, staring 
blankly at the crystal ball, trying to keep his mind empty when t h o u g h t s s u c h a s “ t h i s i s s t u p i d ” k e p t d r i f t i n g a c r o s s i t . I t d i d n ’ t 
help that Ron kept breaking into silent giggles and Hermione kept 
tutting. 
“Seen anything yet?” Harry asked them after a quarter of an 
hour’s quiet crystal gazing. 
“Yeah, there’s a burn on this ta ble,” said Ron, pointing. “Some-
one’s spilled their candle.” 
“This is such a waste of time,” Hermione hissed. “I could be 
practicing something useful. I could be catching up on Cheering 
Charms —” 
Professor Trelawney rustled past. 
“Would anyone like me to help them interpret the shadowy por-
tents within their Orb?” she murm ured over the clinking of her 
bangles. 
“I don’t need help,” Ron whispe red. “It’s obvious what this 
means. There’s going to be loads of fog tonight.” 
Both Harry and Hermione burst out laughing. “Now, really!” said Professor Trelawney as everyone’s heads 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 298  turned in their direction. Parv ati and Lavender were looking 
scandalized. “You are disturbing th e clairvoyant vibrations!” She ap-
proached their table and peered into their crystal ball. Harry felt 
his heart sinking. He was sure he knew what was coming — 
“There is something here!” Pro fessor Trelawney whispered, low-
ering her face to the ball, so that it was reflected twice in her huge 
glasses. “Something moving . . . but what is it?” 
Harry was prepared to bet ever ything he owned, including his 
Firebolt, that it wasn’t good ne ws, whatever it was. And sure 
enough — 
“My dear . . . ,” Professor Trelawney breathed, gazing up at 
Harry. “It is here, plainer than ever before . . . my dear, stalking 
toward you, growing ever closer . . . the Gr —” 
“Oh, for goodness’ sake!” said Hermione loudly. “Not that ridicu-
lous Grim again !” 
Professor Trelawney ra ised her enormous ey es to Hermione’s 
face. Parvati whispered somethin g to Lavender, and they both 
glared at Hermione to o. Professor Trelawney stood up, surveying 
Hermione with unmi stakable anger. 
“I am sorry to say that from the moment you have arrived in this 
class, my dear, it has been apparent that you do not have what the 
noble art of Divination requires. Indeed, I don’t remember ever 
meeting a student whose mind was so hopelessly mundane.” 
There was a moment’s silence. Then — 
“Fine!” said Hermio ne suddenly, getting up and cramming Un-
fogging the Future back into her bag. “Fine!” she repeated, swinging 
the bag over her shoulder and almost knocking Ron off his chair. “I give up! I’m leaving!” 
 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 299  And to the whole class’s amazemen t, Hermione strode over to 
the trapdoor, kicked it open, and climbed down the ladder out of 
sight. 
It took a few minutes for the clas s to settle down again. Profes-
sor Trelawney seemed to have fo rgotten all about the Grim. She 
turned abruptly from Harry and Ron’s table, breathing rather heav-
ily as she tugged her gauzy shawl more closely to her. 
“Ooooo!” said Lavender suddenly, making everyone start. 
“Oooooo, Professor Trelawney, I’ve just remembered! You saw her 
leaving, didn’t you? Didn’t you, Professor? ‘ Around Easter, one of our 
number will leave us forever !’ You said it ages ago, Professor!” 
Professor Trelawney gave her a dewy smile. 
“Yes, my dear, I did indeed know that Miss Granger would be 
leaving us. One hopes, however, that one might ha ve mistaken the 
Signs. . . . The Inner Eye can be a burden, you know. . . .” 
Lavender and Parvati looked deeply impressed, and moved over 
so that Professor Trelawney co uld join their table instead. 
“Some day Hermione’s having, eh?” Ron muttered to Harry, 
looking awed. 
“Yeah . . .” 
Harry glanced into the crystal ba ll but saw nothing but swirling 
white mist. Had Professor Trelawney really seen the Grim again? 
Would he? The last thing he need ed was another ne ar-fatal acci-
dent, with the Qu idditch final drawing ever nearer. 
 
The Easter holidays were not exactly relaxing. The third years had 
never had so much homework. Neville Longbottom seemed close to a nervous collapse, and he wasn’t the only one. 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 300  “Call this a holiday!” Seamus Finnigan roared at the common 
room one afternoon. “The exams ar e ages away, what’re they play-
ing at?” 
But nobody had as much to do as Hermione. Even without Div-
ination, she was taking more subj ects than anybody else. She was 
usually last to leave the common room at night, first to arrive at the 
library the next morning; she had shadows like Lupin’s under her 
eyes, and seemed constantly close to tears. 
Ron had taken over responsibility for Buckbeak’s appeal. When 
he wasn’t doing his own work, he was poring over enormously thick volumes with names like The Handbook of Hippogriff Psy-
chology and Fowl or Foul ? A Study of Hippogriff Brutality. He was so 
absorbed, he even forgot to be horrible to Crookshanks. 
Harry, meanwhile, had to fit in his homework around Quid-
ditch practice every day, not to mention endless discussions of tac-tics with Wood. The Gryffindor-Slytherin match would take place on the first Saturday after the Ea ster holidays. Slytherin was lead-
ing the tournament by exactly two hundred points. This meant (as 
Wood constantly reminded his team ) that they needed to win the 
match by more than th at amount to win the Cup. It also meant 
that the burden of winning fell la rgely on Harry, because capturing 
the Snitch was worth one hundred and fifty points. 
“So you must catch it only if we’re more than fifty points up,” 
Wood told Harry constantly. “Only if we’re more than fifty points 
up, Harry, or we win the match but lose the Cup. You’ve got that, 
haven’t you? You must catch the Snitch only if we’re —” 
“I KNOW, OLIVER!” Harry yelled. 
The whole of Gryffindor House was obsessed with the coming 
 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 301  match. Gryffindor hadn’t won the Quidditch Cup since the leg-
endary Charlie Weasley (Ron’s seco nd oldest brother) had been 
Seeker. But Harry doubted whether any of them, even Wood, 
wanted to win as much as he did. The enmity between Harry and 
Malfoy was at its highest point ever. Malfoy was still smarting about the mud-throwing incident in Hogsmeade and was even 
more furious that Harry had so mehow wormed his way out of 
punishment. Harry hadn’t forgotten Malfoy’s attempt to sabotage 
him in the match against Ravenclaw, but it was the matter of Buck-
beak that made him most determined to beat Malfoy in front of the entire school. 
Never, in anyone’s memory, had a match approached in such a 
highly charged atmosphere. By the time the holidays were over, 
tension between the tw o teams and their Hous es was at the break-
ing point. A number of small scu ffles broke out in the corridors, 
culminating in a nasty incident in which a Gryffindor fourth year 
and a Slytherin sixth year ended up in the hospital wing with leeks 
sprouting out of their ears. 
Harry was having a particularly bad time of it. He couldn’t walk 
to class without Slytherins sticking out their legs and trying to trip 
him up; Crabbe and Goyle kept po pping up wherever he went, and 
slouching away looking disappo inted when they saw him sur-
rounded by people. Wood had gi ven instructions that Harry 
should be accompanied everywhere he went, in case the Slytherins 
tried to put him out of action. The whole of Gryffindor House 
took up the challenge enthusiastically, so that it was impossible for 
Harry to get to classes on time because he was surrounded by a vast, chattering crowd. Harry was more concerne d for his Firebolt’s 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 302  safety than his own. When he wasn’t flying it, he locked it securely 
in his trunk and frequently dashed back up to Gryffindor Tower at 
break times to check that it was still there. 
 
All usual pursuits were abandoned in the Gryffindor common room the night before the matc h. Even Hermione had put down 
her books. 
“I can’t work, I can’t concen trate,” she said nervously. 
There was a great deal of noise. Fred and George Weasley were 
dealing with the pressure by bein g louder and more exuberant than 
ever. Oliver Wood was crouched ov er a model of a Quidditch field 
in the corner, prodding little figu res across it with his wand and 
muttering to himself. Angelina, Al icia, and Katie were laughing at 
Fred’s and George’s jokes. Ha rry was sitting with Ron and Her-
mione, removed from the center of things, trying not to think about the next day, because every ti me he did, he had the horrible 
sensation that something very larg e was fighting to get out of his 
stomach. 
“You’re going to be fine,” Hermione told him, though she 
looked positively terrified. 
“You’ve got a Firebolt !” said Ron. 
“Yeah . . . ,” said Harr y, his stomach writhing. 
It came as a relief when Wood suddenly stood up and yelled, 
“Team! Bed!” 
 
Harry slept badly. First he dreamed that he had overslept, and that 
Wood was yelling, “Where were yo u? We had to use Neville in-
stead!” Then he dreamed that Malf oy and the rest of the Slytherin 
team arrived for the match riding dragons. He was flying at 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 303  breakneck speed, trying to avoid a spurt of flames from Malfoy’s 
steed’s mouth, when he realized he had forgotten his Firebolt. He 
fell through the air and woke with a start. 
It was a few seconds before Harry remembered that the match 
hadn’t taken place yet, that he was safe in bed, and that the 
Slytherin team definitely wouldn’t be allowed to play on dragons. 
He was feeling very thir sty. Quietly as he could, he got out of his 
f o u r - p o s t e r a n d w e n t t o p o u r h i m s e l f s o m e w a t e r f r o m t h e s i l v e r 
jug beneath the window. 
The grounds were still and quiet. No breath of wind disturbed 
the treetops in the Forbidden Fo rest; the Whomping Willow was 
motionless and innocent-looking. It looked as though the condi-
tions for the match would be perfect. 
Harry set down his goblet and was about to turn back to his bed 
when something caught his eye. An animal of some kind was prowling across th e silvery lawn. 
Harry dashed to his bedside table, snatched up his glasses, and 
put them on, then hurried back to the window. It couldn’t be the 
Grim — not now — not ri ght before the match — 
He peered out at the grounds again and, after a minute’s frantic 
searching, spotted it. It was skirting the edge of the forest now. . . . 
It wasn’t the Grim at all . . . it was a cat. . . . Harry clutched the 
window ledge in relief as he reco gnized the bottlebrush tail. It was 
only Crookshanks. . . . 
Or was it only Crookshanks? Harry sq uinted, pressing his nose 
flat against the glass. Crookshanks seemed to have come to a halt. 
Harry was sure he could see someth ing else moving in the shadow 
of the trees too. 
And just then, it emerged — a gigantic, shaggy black dog, 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 304  moving stealthily across the lawn, Crookshanks trotting at its side. 
Harry stared. What did this mean ? If Crookshanks could see the 
dog as well, how could it be an omen of Harry’s death? 
“Ron!” Harry hissed. “Ron! Wake up!” 
“Huh?” 
“I need you to tell me if you can see something!” “S’all dark, Harry,” Ron muttered thickly. “What’re you on 
about?” 
“Down here —” 
Harry looked quickly ba ck out of the window. 
Crookshanks and the dog had vani shed. Harry climbed onto the 
windowsill to look right down into the shadows of the castle, but 
they weren’t there. Where had they gone? 
A loud snore told him Ron had fallen asleep again. 
 
Harry and the rest of the Gryffi ndor team entered the Great Hall 
the next day to enormous applau se. Harry couldn’t help grinning 
broadly as he saw that both the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables 
were applauding them too. The Slytherin table hissed loudly as 
they passed. Harry noti ced that Malfoy looked even paler than 
usual. 
Wood spent the whole of breakfast urging his team to eat, while 
touching nothing himself. Then he hurried them off to the field 
before anyone else had finished, so they could get an idea of 
the conditions. As they left th e Great Hall, everyone applauded 
again. 
“Good luck, Harry!” ca lled Cho. Harry felt himself blushing. 
“Okay — no wind to speak of — sun’s a bit bright, that could 
 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 305  impair your vision, watch out for it — ground’s fairly hard, good, 
that’ll give us a fast kickoff —” 
Wood paced the field, staring ar ound with the team behind him. 
Finally, they saw the front doors of the castle open in the distance 
and the rest of the school spilling onto the lawn. 
“Locker rooms,” said Wood tersely. 
None of them spoke as they changed into their scarlet robes. 
Harry wondered if they were feeling like he was: as though he’d 
eaten something extremely wriggly for breakfast. In what seemed 
like no time at all, Wood was saying, “Okay, it’s time, let’s go —” 
They walked out onto the field to a tidal wave of noise. Three-
quarters of the crowd was wearing scarlet rosettes, waving scarlet 
flags with the Gryffindor lion upon them, or brandishing banners 
with slogans like “GO GRYFFINDOR!” and “LIONS FOR THE 
CUP!” Behind the Slytherin goal posts, however, two hundred 
people were wearing green; the silv er serpent of Slytherin glittered 
on their flags, and Pr ofessor Snape sat in th e very front row, wear-
ing green like everyone el se, and a very grim smile. 
“And here are the Gryffindors!” yelled Lee Jordan, who was act-
ing as commentator as usual. “P otter, Bell, Johnson, Spinnet, 
Weasley, Weasley, and Wood. Wide ly acknowledged as the best 
team Hogwarts has seen in a good few years —” 
Lee’s comments were drowned by a tide of “boos” from the 
Slytherin end. 
“And here come the Slytherin te am, led by Captain Flint. He’s 
made some changes in the lineup and seems to be going for size rather than skill —” 
More boos from the Slytherin crowd. Harry, however, thought 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 306  Lee had a point. Malfoy was easily the smallest person on the 
Slytherin team; the rest of them were enormous. 
“Captains, shake hands!” said Madam Hooch. 
Flint and Wood approached each other and grasped each other’s 
hand very tightly; it looked as though each was trying to break the other’s fingers. 
“Mount your brooms!” said Madam Hooch. “Three . . . two . . . 
one . . .” 
The sound of her whistle was lost in the roar from the crowd as 
fourteen brooms rose into the air. Harry felt his hair fly back off his forehead; his nerves left him in the thrill of the flight; he glanced around, saw Malfoy on his tail, and sped off in search of the Snitch. 
“And it’s Gryffindor in possession, Alicia Spinnet of Gryffindor 
with the Quaffle, heading straight for the Slytherin goal posts, 
looking good, Alicia! Argh, no — Quaffle intercepted by Warring-ton, Warrington of Slytherin te aring up the field — WHAM! — 
nice Bludger work there by Geor ge Weasley, Warrington drops the 
Quaffle, it’s caught by — Johnso n, Gryffindor back in possession, 
come on, Angelina — nice swerve around Montague — duck, An-
gelina, that’s a Bludger ! — SHE SCORES! TEN–ZERO TO 
GRYFFINDOR!” 
Angelina punched the air as she soared around the end of the 
field; the sea of scarlet below was screaming its delight — 
“OUCH!” Angelina was nearly thrown from her broom as Marcus Flint 
went smashing into her. 
“Sorry!” said Flint as the crowd below booed. “Sorry, didn’t see 
her!” 
 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 307  A moment later, Fred Weasley chucked his Beater’s club at the 
back of Flint’s head. Flint’s nose smashed into the handle of his 
broom and began to bleed. 
“That will do!” shrieked Madam Hooch, zooming between 
them. “Penalty shot to Gryffindor for an unprovoked attack on 
their Chaser! Penalty shot to Slyt herin for deliberate damage to 
their Chaser!” 
“Come off it, Miss!” howled Fr ed, but Madam Hooch blew her 
whistle and Alicia flew forw ard to take the penalty. 
“Come on, Alicia!” yelled Lee in to the silence that had de-
scended on the crowd. “YES! SHE’S BEATEN THE KEEPER! 
TWENTY–ZERO TO GRYFFINDOR!” 
Harry turned the Firebolt sharply to watch Flint, still bleeding 
freely, fly forward to take the Sl ytherin penalty. Wood was hovering 
in front of the Gryffindor go al posts, his jaw clenched. 
“ ’Course, Wood’s a superb Keeper !” Lee Jordan told the crowd 
as Flint waited for Madam Hooch’s whistle. “Superb! Very difficult 
to pass — very difficult indeed — YES! I DON’T BELIEVE IT! 
HE’S SAVED IT!” 
Relieved, Harry zoomed away, gazing around for the Snitch, but 
still making sure he caught every word of Lee’s commentary. It was 
essential that he hold Malfoy o ff the Snitch until Gryffindor was 
more than fifty points up — 
“Gryffindor in possession, no, Sl ytherin in possession — no! — 
Gryffindor back in possession and it’s Katie Bell, Katie Bell for 
Gryffindor with the Quaffle, she’s streaking up the field — THAT 
WAS DELIBERATE!” 
Montague, a Slytherin Chaser, had swerved in front of Katie, 
 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 308  and instead of seizing the Quaffle had grabbed her head. Katie cart-
wheeled in the air, managed to st ay on her broom, but dropped the 
Quaffle. 
Madam Hooch’s whistle rang out again as she soared over to 
Montague and began shouting at him. A minute later, Katie had 
put another penalty past the Slytherin Seeker. 
“THIRTY–ZERO! TAKE THAT, YOU DIRTY, CHEAT-
ING —” 
“Jordan, if you can’t commentate in an unbiased way — !” 
“I’m telling it like it is, Professor!” 
Harry felt a huge jolt of excite ment. He had seen the Snitch — 
it was shimmering at the foot of one of the Gryffindor goal posts — but he mustn’t catch it yet — and if Ma lfoy saw it — 
Faking a look of sudden concen tration, Harry pulled his Fire-
bolt around and sped off toward the Slytherin end — it worked. 
Malfoy went haring after him, cl early thinking Harry had seen the 
Snitch there. . . . 
WHOOSH. 
One of the Bludgers came streakin g past Harry’s right ear, hit by 
the gigantic Slytherin Beat er, Derrick. Then again — 
WHOOSH. 
The second Bludger grazed Har ry’s elbow. The other Beater, 
Bole, was closing in. 
Harry had a fleeting glimpse of Bole and Derrick zooming 
toward him, clubs raised — 
He turned the Firebolt upward at the last second, and Bole and 
Derrick collided with a sickening crunch. 
“Ha haaa!” yelled Lee Jordan as the Slytherin Beaters lurched 
away from each other, clutching their heads. “Too bad, boys! You’ll 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 309  need to get up earlier than that to beat a Firebolt! And it’s Gryf-
findor in possession again, as Johnson takes the Quaffle — Flint 
alongside her — poke him in the eye, Angelina! — it was a joke, 
Professor, it was a joke — oh no — Flint in possession, Flint flying 
toward the Gryffindor goal posts, come on now, Wood, save — !” 
But Flint had scored; there was an eruption of cheers from the 
Slytherin end, and Lee swore so badly that Professor McGonagall 
tried to tug the magical me gaphone away from him. 
“Sorry, Professor, sorry! Won’t ha ppen again! So, Gryffindor in 
the lead, thirty points to ten, and Gryffin dor in possession —” 
It was turning into the dirtiest game Harry had ever played 
in. Enraged that Gryffindor had taken such an early lead, the 
Slytherins were rapidly resorting to any means to take the Quaffle. 
Bole hit Alicia with his club and tried to say he’d thought she was a Bludger. George Weasley elbowe d Bole in the face in retalia-
tion. Madam Hooch awarded both teams penalties, and Wood 
pulled off another spectacular save , making the score forty-ten to 
Gryffindor. 
The Snitch had disappeared again. Malfoy was still keeping close 
to Harry as he soared over the match, looking around for it — 
once Gryffindor was fifty points ahead — 
Katie scored. Fifty-ten. Fred and George Weasley were swoop-
ing around her, clubs raised, in case any of the Slytherins were 
thinking of revenge. Bole and Derrick took advantage of Fred’s and 
George’s absence to aim both Bludgers at Wood; they caught him 
in the stomach, one afte r the other, and he rolled over in the air, 
clutching his broom, completely winded. 
Madam Hooch was beside herself. “YOU DO NOT ATTACK THE KEEPER UNLESS THE 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 310  QUAFFLE IS WITHIN THE SCORING AREA!” she shrieked at 
Bole and Derrick. “G ryffindor penalty!” 
And Angelina scored. Sixty-ten. Moments later, Fred Weasley 
pelted a Bludger at Warrington, knocking the Quaffle out of his 
hands; Alicia seized it and put it through the Sl ytherin goal — 
seventy-ten. 
The Gryffindor crowd below wa s screaming itself hoarse — 
Gryffindor was sixty points in the lead, and if Harry caught the 
Snitch now, the Cup was theirs. Harry could almost feel hundreds 
of eyes following him as he soared around the field, high above the 
rest of the game, with Malfoy speeding along behind him. 
And then he saw it. The Snitch wa s sparkling twenty feet above 
him. 
Harry put on a huge burst of spee d; the wind was roaring in his 
ears; he stretched out his hand, but suddenly, the Firebolt was slow-ing down — 
Horrified, he looked around. Ma lfoy had thrown himself for-
ward, grabbed hold of the Firebolt’s tail, an d was pulling it back. 
“You —” 
Harry was angry enough to hit Ma lfoy, but couldn’t reach — 
Malfoy was panting with the effort of holding onto the Firebolt, 
but his eyes were sparkling malici ously. He had achieved what he’d 
wanted to do — the Snitch had disappeared again. 
“Penalty! Penalty to Gryffindor! I’ve never seen such tactics!” 
Madam Hooch screeched, shooting up to where Malfoy was slid-
ing back onto his Nimbus Two Thousand and One. 
“YOU CHEATING SCUM!” Lee Jordan was howling into the 
megaphone, dancing out of Professor McGonagall’s reach. “YOU 
FILTHY, CHEATING B —” 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 311  Professor McGonagall didn’t even bother to tell him off. She was 
actually shaking her finger in Malfoy’s direction, her hat had fallen 
off, and she too was shouting furiously. 
Alicia took Gryffindor’s penalty , but she was so angry she missed 
by several feet. The Gryffindor te am was losing concentration and 
the Slytherins, delighted by Malfoy ’s foul on Harry, were being 
spurred on to greater heights. 
“Slytherin in poss ession, Slytherin heading for goal — 
Montague scores —” Lee groaned. “Seventy-twenty to Gryf-
findor. . . .” 
Harry was now marking Malfoy so closely their knees kept hit-
ting each other. Harry wa sn’t going to let Malfoy anywhere near the 
Snitch. . . . 
“Get out of it, Potter!” Malfoy yelled in frustration as he tried to 
turn and found Ha rry blocking him. 
“Angelina Johnson gets the Quaffle for Gryffindor, come on, 
Angelina, COME ON!” 
Harry looked around. Every single Slytherin player apart from 
Malfoy was streaking up the pitch toward Angelina, including the 
Slytherin Keeper — they were all going to block her — 
Harry wheeled the Firebolt around, bent so low he was lying flat 
along the handle, and kicked it fo rward. Like a bullet, he shot 
toward the Slytherins. 
“AAAAAAARRRGH!” 
They scattered as the Firebolt zoomed toward them; Angelina’s 
way was clear. 
“SHE SCORES! SHE SCORES! G ryffindor leads by eighty 
points to twenty!” 
Harry, who had almost pelted head long into the stands, skidded 
CHAPTER FIFTEEN 
 312  to a halt in midair, reversed, an d zoomed back into the middle of 
the field. 
And then he saw something to make his heart stand still. Malfoy 
was diving, a look of triumph on his face — there, a few feet above 
the grass below, was a tiny, golden glimmer — 
Harry urged the Firebolt downw ard, but Malfoy was miles 
ahead — 
“Go! Go! Go!” Harry urged his broom. He was gaining on Mal-
foy — Harry flattened himself to th e broom handle as Bole sent a 
Bludger at him — he was at Malfoy’s ankles — he was level — 
Harry threw himself forward, to ok both hands off his broom. 
He knocked Malfoy’s arm out of the way and — 
“YES!” 
He pulled out of his dive, his hand in the air, and the stadium 
exploded. Harry soared above the crowd, an odd ringing in his 
ears. The tiny golden ball was held tight in his fist, beating its wings hopelessly against his fingers. 
Then Wood was speeding toward him , half-blinded by tears; he 
seized Harry around the neck and sobbed unrestrainedly into his 
shoulder. Harry felt two large th umps as Fred and George hit 
them; then Angelina’s, Alicia’s, and Katie’s voices, “ We’ve won the 
Cup! We’ve won the Cup !” Tangled together in a many-armed hug, 
the Gryffindor team sank, yell ing hoarsely, back to earth. 
Wave upon wave of crimson supporters was pouring over the 
barriers onto the field. Hands we re raining down on their backs. 
Harry had a confused impression of noise and bodies pressing in 
on him. Then he, and the rest of the team, were hoisted onto the 
shoulders of the crowd. Thrust into the light, he saw Hagrid, plas- 
 
THE QUIDDITCH FINAL 
 313  tered with crimson rosettes — “Yeh beat ’em, Harry, yeh beat ’em! 
Wait till I tell Buckbeak!” There was Percy, jumping up and down 
like a maniac, all dignity forgotte n. Professor McGonagall was sob-
bing harder even than Wood, wi ping her eyes with an enormous 
Gryffindor flag; and there, fighti ng their way toward Harry, were 
Ron and Hermione. Words failed them. They simply beamed as 
Harry was borne toward the st ands, where Dumbledore stood 
waiting with the enormous Quidditch Cup. 
If only there had been a dementor around. . . . As a sobbing 
Wood passed Harry the Cup, as he li fted it into the air, Harry felt 
he could have produced the world’s best Patronus.

arry’s euphoria at finall y winning the Quidditch Cup 
lasted at least a w eek. Even the weather seemed to be cel-
ebrating; as June approached, the days became clou dless and sultry, 
and all anybody felt li ke doing was strolling onto the grounds and 
flopping down on the grass with several pints of iced pumpkin 
juice, perhaps playing a casual ga me of Gobstones or watching the 
giant squid propel itself dreamily across the surface of the lake. 
But they couldn’t. Exams were ne arly upon them, and instead of 
lazing around outside, the students were forced to remain inside 
the castle, trying to bully their br ains into concentrating while en-
ticing wafts of summer air drifte d in through the windows. Even 
Fred and George Weasley had been spotted working; they were 
about to take their O.W.L.s (Ordinary Wizarding Levels). Percy 
was getting ready to take his N. E.W.T.s (Nastily Exhausting Wiz-
arding Tests), the highest qualificat ion Hogwarts offered. As Percy 
 H 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 315  hoped to enter the Mini stry of Magic, he needed top grades. He 
was becoming increasingly edgy, and gave very severe punishments 
to anybody who disturbed the quie t of the common room in the 
evenings. In fact, the only person who seemed more anxious than 
Percy was Hermione. 
Harry and Ron had give n up asking her how she was managing 
to attend several classe s at once, but they co uldn’t restrain them-
selves when they saw the exam sc hedule she had drawn up for her-
self. The first column read: 
 
Monday 
9 o’clock, Arithmancy 
9 o’clock, Transfiguration 
Lunch 1 o’clock, Charms 
1 o’clock, Ancient Runes 
 
“Hermione?” Ron said cautiously, be cause she was liable to explode 
when interrupted these days. “Er — are you sure you’ve copied 
down these times right?” 
“What?” snapped Hermione, picking up the exam schedule and 
examining it. “Yes, of course I have.” 
“Is there any point asking how yo u’re going to sit for two exams 
at once?” said Harry. 
“No,” said Hermione shortly. “Hav e either of you seen my copy 
of Numerology and Gramatica ?” 
“Oh, yeah, I borrowed it for a bit of bedtime reading,” said Ron, 
but very quietly. Hermione started shifting heaps of parchment 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 316  around on her table, looking for the book. Just then, there was a 
rustle at the window and Hedwig fluttered through it, a note 
clutched tight in her beak. 
“It’s from Hagrid,” said Harry, ripping the note open. “Buck-
beak’s appeal — it’s set for the sixth.” 
“That’s the day we finish our ex ams,” said Hermione, still look-
ing everywhere for her Arithmancy book. 
“And they’re coming up here to do it,” said Harry, still reading 
from the letter. “Someone from th e Ministry of Magic and — and 
an executioner.” 
Hermione looked up, startled. “They’re bringing the executioner to the appeal! But that sounds 
as though they’ve already decided!” 
“Yeah, it does,” said Harry slowly. 
“They can’t!” Ron howled. “I’ve spent ages reading up on stuff 
for him; they can’t ju st ignore it all!” 
But Harry had a horrible feeling that the Committee for the 
Disposal of Dangerous Creatures had ha d its mind made up for it 
by Mr. Malfoy. Draco, who had been noticeably subdued since 
Gryffindor’s triumph in the Qui dditch final, seemed to regain 
some of his old swagger over th e next few days. From sneering 
comments Harry overhe ard, Malfoy was certain Buckbeak was go-
ing to be killed, and seemed thoroughly pleased with himself for 
bringing it about. It was all Harry could do to stop himself imitat-
ing Hermione and hitting Malfoy in the face on these occasions. 
And the worst thing of all was that they had no time or opportu-
nity to go and see Hagrid, because the strict new security measures 
had not been lifted, and Harry didn’t dare retrieve his Invisibility 
Cloak from below the one-eyed witch. 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 317  
   
Exam week began and an unnatura l hush fell over the castle. The 
third years emerged from Transfig uration at lunchtime on Monday, 
limp and ashen-faced, comparing results and bemoaning the diffi-
culty of the tasks they had been se t, which had included turning a 
teapot into a tortoise. Hermione i rritated the rest by fussing about 
how her tortoise had looked more like a turtle, which was the least 
of everyone else’s worries. 
“Mine still had a spout for a ta il, what a nightmare. . . .” 
“Were the tortoises supposed to breathe steam?” 
“It still had a willow-patterned shell, d’you think that’ll count 
against me?” 
Then, after a hasty lunch, it was straight back up stairs for the 
Charms exam. Hermione had been ri ght; Professor Flitwick did in-
deed test them on Cheering Char ms. Harry slightly overdid his out 
of nerves and Ron, who was partnering him, ended up in fits of 
hysterical laughter and had to be led away to a quiet room for an 
hour before he was ready to perform the charm himself. After din-ner, the students hurried back to their common rooms, not to re-
lax, but to start studying for Care of Magical Crea tures, Potions, 
and Astronomy. 
Hagrid presided over the Care of Magical Creatures exam the 
following morning with a very preoccupied air indeed; his heart 
didn ’ t seem to be in it at all. He had provided a large tub of fresh 
flobberworms for the class, and to ld them that to pass the test, 
their flobberworm had to still be alive at the end of one hour. 
As flobberworms flourished best if left to their own devices, it 
was the easiest exam any of them had ever taken, and also gave 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 318  Harry, Ron, and Hermione plenty of opportunity to speak to 
Hagrid. 
“Beaky’s gettin’ a bit depressed, ” Hagrid told them, bending low 
on the pretense of checking th at Harry’s flobberworm was still 
alive. “Bin cooped up too long. But still . . . we’ll know day after 
tomorrow — one way or the other —” 
They had Potions that afternoon , which was an unqualified dis-
aster. Try as Harry might, he co uldn’t get his Confusing Concoc-
tion to thicken, and Snape, standing watch with an air of vindictive 
pleasure, scribbled something that looked suspiciously like a zero 
onto his notes before moving away. 
Then came Astronomy at midnig ht, up on the tallest tower; 
History of Magic on Wednesday morning, in which Harry 
scribbled everything Florean Fort escue had ever told him about 
medieval witch-hunts, while wish ing he could have had one of 
Fortescue’s choco-nut sundaes with him in the stifling classroom. 
Wednesday afternoon meant Herbology, in the greenhouses under 
a baking-hot sun; then back to the common room once more, with 
sunburnt necks, thinking longingly of this time next day, when it 
would all be over. 
Their second to last exam, on Thursday morning, was Defense 
Against the Dark Arts. Professor Lupin had compiled the most un-
usual exam any of them had ever taken; a sort of obstacle course 
outside in the sun, where they had to wade across a deep paddling pool containing a grindylow, cross a series of potholes full of Red 
Caps, squish their way across a pa tch of marsh while ignoring mis-
leading directions from a hinkypunk, then climb into an old trunk 
and battle with a new boggart. 
 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 319  “Excellent, Harry,” Lupin muttered as Harry climbed out of the 
trunk, grinning. “Full marks.” 
Flushed with his succ ess, Harry hung around to watch Ron and 
Hermione. Ron did very well until he reached the hinkypunk, 
which successfully confused him into sinking waist-high into the 
quagmire. Hermione did everything perfectly until she reached the 
trunk with the boggart in it. After about a mi nute inside it, she 
burst out again, screaming. 
“Hermione!” said Lupin, startled. “What’s the matter?” 
“P — P — Professor McGonagall !” Hermione gasp ed, pointing 
into the trunk. “Sh — she sa id I’d failed everything!” 
It took a little while to calm He rmione down. When at last she 
had regained a grip on herself, she, Harry, and Ron went back to 
the castle. Ron was still slightly inclined to laugh at Hermione’s 
boggart, but an argument was averted by the sight that met them 
on the top of the steps. 
Cornelius Fudge, sweating slightly in his pinstriped cloak, was 
standing there staring out at the gr ounds. He started at the sight of 
Harry. 
“Hello there, Harry!” he said . “Just had an exam, I expect? 
Nearly finished?” 
“Yes,” said Harry. Hermione and Ron, not bein g on speaking 
terms with the Minister of Magic, hovered awkwardl y in the back-
ground. 
“Lovely day,” said Fudge, casting an eye over the lake. 
“Pity . . . pity . . .” 
He sighed deeply and looked down at Harry. 
“I’m here on an unpleasant mission, Harry. The Committee for 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 320  the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures required a witness to the exe-
cution of a mad hippogriff. As I n eeded to visit Hogwarts to check 
on the Black situation, I was asked to step in.” 
“Does that mean the appeal’s already happened?” Ron inter-
rupted, stepping forward. 
“No, no, it’s scheduled for this afternoon,” said Fudge, looking 
curiously at Ron. 
“Then you might not have to wit ness an execution at all!” said 
Ron stoutly. “The hipp ogriff might get off!” 
Before Fudge could answer, two wi zards came through the castle 
doors behind him. One was so ancient he appeared to be withering 
before their very eyes; the other wa s tall and strapping, with a thin 
black mustache. Harry gathered that they were representatives of 
the Committee for the Disposal of Dangerous Creatures, because the very old wizard squinted towa rd Hagrid’s cabin and said in a 
feeble voice, “Dear, dear, I’m getting too old for this. . . . Two 
o’clock, isn’t it, Fudge?” 
The black-mustached man was fingering something in his belt; 
Harry looked and saw that he wa s running one broad thumb along 
the blade of a shining axe. Ron opened his mouth to say some-
thing, but Hermione nudged him ha rd in the ribs and jerked her 
head toward the entrance hall. 
“Why’d you stop me?” said Ron an grily as they entered the Great 
Hall for lunch. “Did you see them ? They’ve even got the axe ready! 
This isn’t justice!” 
“Ron, your dad works for the Ministry, you can’t go saying 
things like that to his boss!” said Hermione, but she too looked 
very upset. “As long as Hagrid keeps his head this time, and argues 
his case properly, they can’t po ssibly execute Bu ckbeak. . . .” 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 321  But Harry could tell Hermione didn ’t really believe what she was 
saying. All around them, people we re talking excitedly as they ate 
their lunch, happily anticipating the end of the exams that after-
noon, but Harry, Ron, and Hermio ne, lost in worry about Hagrid 
and Buckbeak, didn’t join in. 
Harry’s and Ron’s last exam was Divination; Hermione’s, 
M u g g l e S t u d i e s . T h e y w a l k e d u p t h e m a r b l e s t a i r c a s e t o g e t h e r ; 
Hermione left them on the fi rst floor and Harry and Ron pro-
ceeded all the way up to the seventh, where many of their class were sitting on the spiral staircase to Professor Trelawney’s classroom, 
trying to cram in a bit of last-minute studying. 
“She’s seeing us all separately,” Neville informed them as they 
went to sit down next to him. He had his copy of Unfogging the Fu-
ture open on his lap at the pages devoted to crysta l gazing. “Have 
either of you ever seen anything in a crystal ball? ” he asked them 
unhappily. 
“Nope,” said Ron in an offhand voice. He kept checking his 
watch; Harry knew that he was counting down the time until 
Buckbeak’s appeal started. 
The line of people outside the cl assroom shortened very slowly. 
As each person climbed back down th e silver ladder, the rest of the 
class hissed, “What did sh e ask? Was it okay?” 
But they all refused to say. 
“She says the crystal ball’s told her that if I tell you, I’ll have a 
horrible accident!” squeaked Neville as he clambered back down the 
ladder toward Harry and Ron, who had now reached the landing. 
“That’s convenient,” snorted Ron. “You know, I’m starting to 
think Hermione was right about her” — he jabbed his thumb 
toward the trapdoor overhead — “she’s a right old fraud.” 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 322  “Yeah,” said Harry, looking at his own watch. It was now two 
o’clock. “Wish she’d hurry up . . .” 
Parvati came back down the ladder glowing with pride. 
“She says I’ve got all the making s of a true Seer,” she informed 
Harry and Ron. “I saw loads of stuff. . . . Well, good luck!” 
She hurried off down the spiral staircase toward Lavender. 
“Ronald Weasley,” said the familiar, misty voice from over their 
heads. Ron grimaced at Harry and climbed the silver ladder out of sight. Harry was now the only person left to be tested. He settled 
himself on the floor with his back against the wall, listening to a fly 
buzzing in the sunny window, hi s mind across the grounds with 
Hagrid. 
Finally, after about twenty minu tes, Ron’s large feet reappeared 
on the ladder. 
“How’d it go?” Harry asked him, standing up. 
“Rubbish,” said Ron. “Couldn’t se e a thing, so I made some stuff 
up. Don’t think she was co nvinced, though. . . .” 
“Meet you in the common room,” Harry muttered as Professor 
Trelawney’s voice called, “Harry Potter!” 
The tower room was hotter than ev er before; the curtains were 
closed, the fire was alight, and the usual sickly scent made Harry cough as he stumbled through the clutter of chairs and tables to 
where Professor Trelawney sat waitin g for him before a large crystal 
ball. 
“Good day, my dear,” she said softly. “If you would kindly gaze 
into the Orb. . . . Take your time , now . . . then tell me what you 
see within it. . . .” 
Harry bent over the crystal ball and stared, stared as hard as he

 323  could, willing it to show him so mething other than swirling white 
fog, but nothing happened. 
“Well?” Professor Trelawney prom pted delicately. “What do you 
see?” 
The heat was overpowering and his nostrils were stinging with 
the perfumed smoke wafting from the fire beside them. He 
thought of what Ron had just said, and decided to pretend. 
“Er —” said Harry, “a da rk shape . . . um . . .” 
“What does it resemble?” whis pered Professor Trelawney. 
“Think, now . . .” 
Harry cast his mind around and it landed on Buckbeak. 
“A hippogriff,” he said firmly. 
“Indeed!” whispered Professor Tr elawney, scribbling keenly on 
the parchment perched upon her k nees. “My boy, you may well be 
seeing the outcome of poor Hagrid ’s trouble with the Ministry of 
Magic! Look closer. . . . Does the hippogriff appear to . . . have its 
head?” 
“Yes,” said Harry firmly. 
“Are you sure?” Professor Trelawney urged him. “Are you quite 
sure, dear? You don’t see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a 
shadowy figure raisin g an axe behind it?” 
“No!” said Harry, starting to feel slightly sick. 
“No blood? No we eping Hagrid?” 
“No!” said Harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the 
room and the heat. “It looks fine , it’s — flying away. . . .” 
Professor Trelawney sighed. 
“Well, dear, I think we’ll leave it there. . . . A little disappoint-
ing . . . but I’m sure you did your best.” 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 324  Relieved, Harry got up, picked up his bag and turned to go, but 
then a loud, harsh vo ice spoke behind him. 
“It will happen tonight.” 
Harry wheeled around. Professor Trelawney had gone rigid in 
her armchair; her eyes were unfocused and her mouth sagging. 
“S — sorry?” said Harry. 
But Professor Trelawney didn’t seem to hear him. Her eyes 
started to roll. Harry sat there in a panic. She looked as though she 
was about to have some sort of se izure. He hesitated, thinking of 
running to the hospital wing — and then Prof essor Trelawney 
spoke again, in the same harsh voice, quite unlike her own: 
“The Dark Lord lies alone and friendless, abandoned by 
his followers. His servant has been chained these twelve 
years. Tonight, before midnight . . . the servant will break 
free and set out to rejoin his master. The Dark Lord will 
rise again with his servant’s aid, greater and more terrible 
than ever he was. Tonight . . . before midnight . . . the ser-
vant . . . will set out . . . to rejoin . . . his master. . . .” 
Professor Trelawney’s head fell forward onto her chest. She made 
a grunting sort of noise. Harry sat there, staring at her. Then, quite 
suddenly, Professor Trelawney’ s head snapped up again. 
“I’m so sorry, dear boy,” she said dreamily, “the heat of the day, 
you know . . . I drifted off for a moment. . . .” 
Harry sat there, staring at her. 
“Is there anything wrong, my dear?” “You — you just told me that the — the Dark Lord’s going to 
rise again . . . that his servant’s going to go back to him. . . .” 
Professor Trelawney looked thoroughly startled. 
 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 325  “The Dark Lord? He-Who-Must- Not-Be-Named? My dear boy, 
that’s hardly something to joke ab out. . . . Rise again, indeed —” 
“But you just said it! Yo u said the Dark Lord —” 
“I think you must ha ve dozed off too, de ar!” said Professor 
Trelawney. “I would certainly no t presume to predict anything 
quite as far-fetched as that!” 
Harry climbed back down the ladder and the spiral staircase, 
wondering . . . had he just heard Professor Trelawney make a real 
prediction? Or had that been her id ea of an impressive end to the 
test? 
Five minutes later he was dashing past the security trolls outside 
the entrance to Gryffindor Tower, Professor Trelawney’s words still 
resounding in his head. People were striding past him in the oppo-site direction, laughing and joking, heading for the grounds and a 
bit of long-awaited freedom; by the time he had reached the por-
trait hole and entered the common room, it was almost deserted. 
Over in the corner, howeve r, sat Ron and Hermione. 
“Professor Trelawney,” Harry panted, “just told me —” 
But he stopped abru ptly at the sight of their faces. 
“Buckbeak lost,” said Ron weakly. “Hagrid’s just sent this.” 
Hagrid’s note was dry this time, no tears had splattered it, yet his 
hand seemed to have shaken so much as he wrote that it was hardly 
legible. 
 
Lost appeal. They’re going to execute at sunset. 
Nothing you can do. Don’t come down. I don’t want you to see it Hagrid 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 326  “We’ve got to go,” said Harry at once. “He can’t just sit there on 
his own, waiting fo r the executioner!” 
“Sunset, though,” said Ron, wh o was staring out the window in 
a glazed sort of way. “We’d never be allowed . . . ’specially you, 
Harry. . . .” 
Harry sank his head into his hands, thinking. 
“If we only had the Invi sibility Cloak. . . .” 
“Where is it?” said Hermione. Harry told her about leaving it in the passageway under the one-
eyed witch. 
“. . . if Snape sees me anywhere near there again, I’m in serious 
trouble,” he finished. 
“That’s true,” said Hermione, getting to her feet. “If he sees 
you. . . . How do you open the witch’s hump again?” 
“You — you tap it and say, ‘ Dissendium, ’ ” said Harry. “But —” 
Hermione didn’t wait for the re st of his sentence; she strode 
across the room, pushed open the Fat Lady’s portrait and vanished 
from sight. 
“She hasn’t gone to get it?” Ron said, staring after her. 
She had. Hermione returned a quar ter of an hour later with the 
silvery cloak folded car efully under her robes. 
“Hermione, I don’t know what’s gotten into you lately!” said 
Ron, astounded. “First you hit Malfoy, then you walk out on Pro-
fessor Trelawney —” 
Hermione looked rather flattered. 
 
They went down to dinner with ev erybody else, but did not return 
to Gryffindor Tower afterward. Harry had the cloak hidden down the front of his robes; he had to keep his arms folded to hide the 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 327  lump. They skulked in an empty chamber off the entrance hall, lis-
tening, until they were sure it wa s deserted. They heard a last pair 
of people hurrying across the ha ll and a door slamming. Hermione 
poked her head ar ound the door. 
“Okay,” she whispered, “no one there — cloak on —” 
Walking very close together so that nobody wo uld see them, 
they crossed the hall on tiptoe be neath the cloak, then walked down 
the stone front steps into the grounds. The sun was already sinking 
behind the Forbidden Forest, gildin g the top branches of the trees. 
They reached Hagrid’s cabin and knocked. He was a minute in 
answering, and when he did, he l ooked all around for his visitor, 
pale-faced and trembling. 
“It’s us,” Harry hissed. “We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let 
us in and we can take it off.” 
“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered, but he stood back, 
and they stepped inside. Hagrid shut the door quickly and Harry 
pulled off the cloak. 
Hagrid was not crying, nor did he throw himself upon their 
necks. He looked like a man who did not know where he was or 
what to do. This he lplessness was wo rse to watch than tears. 
“Wan’ some tea?” he said. His gr eat hands were shaking as he 
reached for the kettle. 
“Where’s Buckbeak, Hagrid?” said Hermione hesitantly. “I — I took him outside,” said Ha grid, spilling milk all over the 
table as he filled up the jug. “H e’s tethered in me pumpkin patch. 
Thought he oughta see the trees an’ — an’ smell fresh air — before —” 
Hagrid’s hand trembled so viol ently that the milk jug slipped 
from his grasp and shatte red all over the floor. 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 328  “I’ll do it, Hagrid,” said Hermione quickly, hurrying over and 
starting to clean up the mess. 
“There’s another one in the cu pboard,” Hagrid said, sitting 
down and wiping his forehead on hi s sleeve. Harry glanced at Ron, 
who looked back hopelessly. 
“Isn’t there anything anyone can do, Hagrid?” Harry asked 
fiercely, sitting down next to him. “Dumbledore —” 
“He’s tried,” said Hagrid. “He’s got no power ter overrule the 
Committee. He told ’em Buckbe ak’s all right, but they’re 
scared. . . . Yeh know what Lucius Ma lfoy’s like . . . threatened ’em, 
I expect . . . an’ the executioner, Macnair, he’s an old pal o’ Mal-
foy’s . . . but it’ll be quick an’ clean . . . an’ I’ll be beside him. . . .” 
Hagrid swallowed. His eyes were darting all over the cabin as 
though looking for some shred of hope or comfort. 
“Dumbledore’s gonna come down while it — while it happens. 
Wrote me this mornin’. Said he wants ter — ter be with me. Great 
man, Dumbledore. . . .” 
Hermione, who had been rummaging in Hagrid’s cupboard for 
another milk jug, let out a small, quickly stifled sob. She straight-
ened up with the new jug in he r hands, fighting back tears. 
“We’ll stay with you too, Hagrid ,” she began, but Hagrid shook 
his shaggy head. 
“Yeh’re ter go back up ter the ca stle. I told yeh, I don’ wan’ yeh 
watchin’. An’ yeh shouldn’ be down here anyway. . . . If Fudge an’ Dumbledore catch yeh out without permission, Harry, yeh’ll be in 
big trouble.” 
Silent tears were now streaming down Hermione’s face, but she 
hid them from Hagrid, bustling around making tea. Then, as she 
 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 329  picked up the milk bottle to pour some into the jug, she let out a 
shriek. 
“Ron! I — I don’t believe it — it’s Scabbers !” 
Ron gaped at her. 
“What are you talking about?” 
Hermione carried the milk jug over to the table and turned it 
upside down. With a frantic squeak, and much scrambling to get 
back inside, Scabbers the rat came sliding out onto the table. 
“Scabbers!” said Ron blankly. “Scabbers, what are you doing 
here?” 
He grabbed the struggling rat and held him up to the light. 
Scabbers looked dreadful. He was thinner than ever, large tufts of 
hair had fallen out leaving wide ba ld patches, and he writhed in 
Ron’s hands as though de sperate to free himself. 
“It’s okay, Scabbers!” said Ron. “No cats! There’s nothing here to 
hurt you!” 
Hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window. His 
normally ruddy face had gone the color of parchment. 
“They’re comin’. . . .” 
Harry, Ron, and Hermione whipped around. A group of men 
was walking down the distant cast le steps. In front was Albus 
Dumbledore, his silver beard gleami ng in the dying sun. Next to 
him trotted Cornelius Fudge. Be hind them came the feeble old 
Committee member and the executioner, Macnair. 
“Yeh gotta go,” said Hagrid. Every inch of him was trembling. 
“They mustn’ find yeh here . . . . Go now. . . .” 
Ron stuffed Scabbers into his pocket and Hermione picked up 
the cloak. 
 
CHAPTER SIXTEEN 
 330  “I’ll let yeh out the back way,” said Hagrid. 
They followed him to the door into his back garden. Harry felt 
strangely unreal, and even more so when he saw Buckbeak a few 
yards away, tethered to a tree behind Hagrid’s pumpkin patch. 
B u c k b e a k s e e m e d t o k n o w s o m e t h i n g w a s h a p p e n i n g . H e t u r n e d 
his sharp head from side to side and pawed the ground nervously. 
“It’s okay, Beaky,” said Hagrid soft ly. “It’s okay . . .” He turned 
to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Go on,” he said. “Get goin’.” 
But they didn’t move. 
“Hagrid, we can’t —” 
“We’ll tell them what really happened —” “They can’t kill him —” 
“Go!” said Hagrid fiercely. “It’ s bad enough without you lot in 
trouble an’ all!” 
They had no choice. As Hermio ne threw the cloak over Harry 
and Ron, they heard voices at the front of the cabin. Hagrid looked 
at the place where they had just vanished from sight. 
“Go quick,” he said hoarse ly. “Don’ listen. . . .” 
And he strode back into his ca bin as someone knocked at the 
front door. 
Slowly, in a kind of horrified trance, Harry, Ron, and Hermione 
set off silently around Hagrid’s house. As they reached the other 
side, the front door clos ed with a sharp snap. 
“Please, let’s hurry,” Hermione whispered. “I can’t stand it, I 
can’t bear it. . . .” 
They started up the sloping lawn toward the castle. The sun was 
sinking fast now; the sky had turned to a clear, purple-tinged grey, 
but to the west there was a ruby-red glow. 
 
PROFESSOR TRELAWNEY’S PREDICTION 
 331  Ron stopped dead. 
“Oh, please, Ron,” Hermione began. 
“It’s Scabbers — he won’t — stay put —” Ron was bent over, trying to keep Scabbers in his pocket, but the 
rat was going berserk; squeaking madly, twisting and flailing, try-ing to sink his teeth into Ron’s hand. 
“Scabbers, it’s me, you idio t, it’s Ron,” Ron hissed. 
They heard a door open behi nd them and men’s voices. 
“Oh, Ron, please let’s move, th ey’re going to do it!” Hermione 
breathed. 
“Okay — Scabbers, stay put —” 
They walked forward; Harry, like Hermione, was trying not to 
listen to the rumble of voices behind them. Ron stopped again. 
“I can’t hold him — Scabbers, sh ut up, everyone’ll hear us —” 
The rat was squealing wildly, but not loudly enough to cover up 
the sounds drifting from Hagrid’s garden. There was a jumble of indistinct male voices, a silence, and then, without warning, the 
unmistakable swish and thud of an axe. 
Hermione swayed on the spot. 
“They did it!” she whispered to Harry. “I d — don’t believe it — 
they did it!”

arry’s mind had gone blank with shock. The three of them stood transfixed with horror un der the Invisibility Cloak. 
The very last rays of the setting su n were casting a bloody light over 
the long-shadowed grounds. Then, behind them, they heard a wild 
howling. 
“Hagrid,” Harry muttered. Without thinking about what he 
was doing, he made to turn back, but both Ron and Hermione 
seized his arms. 
“We can’t,” said Ron, who was pa per-white. “He’ll be in worse 
trouble if they know we’v e been to see him. . . .” 
Hermione’s breathing was shallow and uneven. 
“How — could — they?” she choked. “How could they?” 
“Come on,” said Ron, whose te eth seemed to be chattering. 
They set off back toward the castle, walking slowly to keep 
themselves hidden under the cloak. The light was fading fast now. 
 H 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 333  By the time they reached open grou nd, darkness was settling like a 
spell around them. 
“Scabbers, keep still,” Ron hissed, clamping his hand over his 
chest. The rat was wriggling madly. Ron came to a sudden halt, try-
ing to force Scabbers deeper into his pocket. “What’s the matter 
with you, you stupid rat? St ay still — OUCH! He bit me!” 
“Ron, be quiet!” Hermione whispered urgently. “Fudge’ll be out 
here in a minute —” 
“He won’t — stay — put —” Scabbers was plainly terrified. He was writhing with all his 
might, trying to break free of Ron’s grip. 
“What’s the matter with him?” 
But Harry had just seen — slinki ng toward them, his body low 
to the ground, wide yellow eyes glinting eerily in the darkness — 
Crookshanks. Whether he could s ee them or was following the 
sound of Scabbers’s squeaks, Harry couldn’t tell. 
“Crookshanks!” Hermione moaned. “No, go away, Crook-
shanks! Go away!” 
But the cat was getting nearer — 
“Scabbers — NO!” 
Too late — the rat had slipped between Ron’s clutching fingers, 
hit the ground, and scampered aw ay. In one bound, Crookshanks 
sprang after him, and before Harry or Hermione could stop him, 
Ron had thrown the Invisibility Cl oak off himself and pelted away 
into the darkness. 
“Ron!” Hermione moaned. 
She and Harry looked at each other, then followed at a sprint; it 
was impossible to run full out unde r the cloak; they pulled it off

 334  a n d i t s t r e a m e d b e h i n d t h e m l i k e a b a n n e r a s t h e y h u r t l e d a f t e r 
Ron; they could hear his feet thundering along ahead and his 
shouts at Crookshanks. 
“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here —” 
There was a loud thud. 
“Gotcha ! Get off, you stinking cat —” 
Harry and Hermione almost fell over Ron; they skidded to a 
stop right in front of him. He was sprawled on the ground, but 
Scabbers was back in his pocket; he had both hands held tight over 
the quivering lump. 
“Ron — come on — back un der the cloak —” Hermione 
panted. “Dumbledore — the Minist er — they’ll be coming back 
out in a minute —” 
But before they could cover themse lves again, before they could 
even catch their breath, they heard the soft pounding of gigantic 
paws. . . . Something was bounding toward them, quiet as a shadow — an enor mous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog. 
Harry reached for his wand, but too late — the dog had made 
an enormous leap and the front paws hit him on the chest; he 
keeled over backward in a whirl of hair; he felt its hot breath, saw 
inch-long teeth — 
But the force of its leap had carried it too far; it rolled off him. 
Dazed, feeling as though his ribs were broken, Harry tried to stand up; he could hear it growling as it skidded around for a new attack. 
Ron was on his feet. As the dog sprang back toward them he 
pushed Harry aside; the dog’s jaws fastened instead around Ron’s outstretched arm. Harry lunged forward, he seized a handful of the brute’s hair, but it was dragging Ro n away as easily as though he 
were a rag doll — 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 335  Then, out of nowhere, something hit Harry so hard across the 
face he was knocked off his feet again. He heard Hermione shriek 
with pain an d fall too. 
Harry groped for his wand, blin king blood out of his eyes — 
“Lumos !” he whispered. 
The wandlight showed him the trunk of a thick tree; they had 
chased Scabbers into the shadow of the Whomping Willow and its 
branches were creaking as though in a high wind, whipping back-
ward and forward to st op them going nearer. 
And there, at the base of the trunk, was the dog, dragging Ron 
backward into a large gap in the roots — Ron was fighting furi-
ously, but his head and torso were slipping out of sight — 
“Ron!” Harry shouted, trying to follow, but a heavy branch 
whipped lethally thro ugh the air and he was forced backward 
again. 
All they could see now was one of Ron’s legs, which he had 
hooked around a root in an effort to stop the dog from pulling him farther underground — but a horribl e crack cut the air like a gun-
shot; Ron’s leg had broken, and a mo ment later, his foot vanished 
from sight. 
“Harry — we’ve got to go for help —” Hermione gasped; she 
was bleeding too; the Willow had cut her across the shoulder. 
“No! That thing’s big enough to eat him; we haven’t got 
time —” 
“Harry — we’re never going to get through without help —” Another branch whipped down at them, twigs clenched like 
knuckles. 
“If that dog can get in, we can, ” Harry panted, darting here and 
there, trying to find a way throug h the vicious, swishing branches, 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 336  but he couldn’t get an inch nearer to the tree roots without being in 
range of the tree’s blows. 
“Oh, help, help,” Hermione whispered frantically, dancing un-
certainly on the sp ot, “please . . .” 
Crookshanks darted forward. He slithered between the battering 
branches like a snake and placed hi s front paws upon a knot on the 
trunk. 
Abruptly, as though the tree had been turned to marble, it 
stopped moving. Not a leaf twitched or shook. 
“Crookshanks!” Hermione whispered uncertainly. She now 
grasped Harry’s arm pa infully hard. “How did he know — ?” 
“He’s friends with that dog,” sa id Harry grimly. “I’ve seen them 
together. Come on — and keep your wand out —” 
They covered the distance to th e trunk in seconds, but before 
they had reached the gap in the roots, Crookshan ks had slid into it 
with a flick of his bottlebrush ta il. Harry went next; he crawled for-
ward, headfirst, and slid down an earthy slope to the bottom of a 
very low tunnel. Crookshanks was a li ttle way along, his eyes flash-
ing in the light from Harry’s wa nd. Seconds later, Hermione slith-
ered down beside him. 
“Where’s Ron?” she whispered in a terrified voice. 
“This way,” said Harry, setting off, bent-backed, after Crook-
shanks. 
“ W h e r e d o e s t h i s t u n n e l c o m e out?” Hermione asked breath-
lessly from behind him. 
“I don’t know. . . . It’s marked on the Marauder’s Map but Fred 
and George said no one’s ever gotten into it. . . . It goes off the edge 
of the map, but it looked like it was heading for Hogsmeade. . . .” 
 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 337  They moved as fast as they coul d, bent almost double; ahead of 
them, Crookshanks’s tail bobbed in and out of view. On and on 
went the passage; it felt at leas t as long as the one to Honey-
dukes. . . . All Harry could thin k of was Ron and what the enor-
mous dog might be doing to him. . . . He was drawing breath in 
sharp, painful gasps, ru nning at a crouch. . . . 
And then the tunnel began to rise ; moments later it twisted, and 
Crookshanks had gone. Instead, Harry could see a patch of dim 
light through a small opening. 
He and Hermione paused, gasping for breath, edging forward. 
Both raised their wands to see what lay beyond. 
It was a room, a very disordered , dusty room. Paper was peeling 
from the walls; there were stains all over the floor; every piece of furniture was broken as though somebody had smashed it. The 
windows were all boarded up. 
Harry glanced at Hermione, who looked very frightened but 
nodded. 
Harry pulled himself out of the hole, staring around. The room 
was deserted, but a door to their right stood open, leading to a 
shadowy hallway. Hermione suddenly grabbed Harry’s arm again. 
Her wide eyes were traveling around the boarded windows. 
“Harry,” she whispered, “I think we’re in the Shrieking Shack.” 
Harry looked around. His eyes fell on a wooden chair near 
them. Large chunks had been torn out of it; one of the legs had 
been ripped off entirely. 
“Ghosts didn’t do that,” he said slowly. 
At that moment, there was a creak overhead. Something had 
moved upstairs. Both of them looked up at the ceiling. Hermione’s 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 338  grip on Harry’s arm was so tight he was losing feeling in his fingers. 
He raised his eyebrows at he r; she nodded again and let go. 
Quietly as they could, they cr ept out into the hall and up the 
crumbling staircase. Everything was covered in a thick layer of dust 
except the floor, where a wide shiny stripe had been made by some-
thing being dragged upstairs. 
They reached the dark landing. 
“Nox,” they whispered together, and th e lights at the end of their 
wands went out. Only one door was open. As they crept toward it, 
they heard movement from behind it; a low moan, and then a 
deep, loud purring. They exchanged a last look, a last nod. 
Wand held tightly before him, Harry kicked the door wide 
open. 
On a magnificent four-poster bed with dusty hangings lay 
Crookshanks, purring loudly at the sight of them. On the floor be-
side him, clutching his leg, which stuck out at a strange angle, was 
Ron. 
Harry and Hermione dashed across to him. 
“Ron — are you okay?” 
“Where’s the dog?” 
“Not a dog,” Ron moaned. His teeth were gritted with pain. 
“Harry, it’s a trap —” 
“What —” 
“He’s the dog . . . he’s an Animagus. . . .” 
Ron was staring over Harry’s sh oulder. Harry wheeled around. 
With a snap, the man in the shad ows closed the door behind them. 
A mass of filthy, matted hair hung to his elbows. If eyes hadn’t 
been shining out of the deep, dark sockets, he might have been a 
 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 339  corpse. The waxy skin was stretched so tightly over the bones of his 
face, it looked like a skull. His ye llow teeth were bared in a grin. It 
was Sirius Black. 
“Expelliarmus !” he croaked, pointing Ron’s wand at them. 
Harry’s and Hermione’s wands shot out of their hands, high in 
the air, and Black caught them. Then he took a step closer. His eyes 
were fixed on Harry. 
“I thought you’d come and help your friend,” he said hoarsely. 
His voice sounded as though he had long since lost the habit of us-
ing it. “Your father wo uld have done the same for me. Brave of you, 
not to run for a te acher. I’m grateful . . . it will make everything 
much easier. . . .” 
The taunt about his father rang in Harry’s ears as though Black 
had bellowed it. A boiling hate erupted in Harry’s chest, leaving no place for fear. For the first time in his life, he wanted his wand back 
in his hand, not to defend himself, but to attack . . . to kill. With-
out knowing what he was doing, he started forward, but there was 
a sudden movement on either side of him and two pairs of hands 
grabbed him and held him back. . . . “No, Harr y!” Hermione 
gasped in a petrified whisper; Ron, however, spoke to Black. 
“If you want to kill Harry, you’ll have to kill us too!” he said 
fiercely, though the effort of standing upright was draining him of 
still more color, and he sway ed slightly as he spoke. 
Something flickered in Black’s shadowed eyes. 
“Lie down,” he said quietly to Ro n. “You will damage that leg 
even more.” 
“Did you hear me?” Ron said weakly, though he was clinging 
painfully to Harry to stay upright. “You’ll have to kill all three of us!” 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 340  “There’ll be only one murder here tonight,” said Black, and his 
grin widened. 
“Why’s that?” Harry spat, trying to wrench himself free of Ron 
and Hermione. “Didn’t care last time, did you? Didn’t mind 
slaughtering all those Muggles to get at Pettigrew. . . . What’s the 
matter, gone soft in Azkaban?” 
“Harry!” Hermio ne whimpered. “Be quiet!” 
“HE KILLED MY MUM AND DAD! ” Harry roared, and with 
a huge effort he broke free of He rmione’s and Ron’s restraint and 
lunged forward — 
He had forgotten about magic — he had forgotten that he was 
short and skinny and thirteen, whereas Black was a tall, full-grown 
man — all Harry knew was that he wanted to hurt Black as badly 
as he could and that he didn ’ t care how much he got hurt in re-turn — 
Perhaps it was the shock of Ha rry doing something so stupid, 
but Black didn’t raise the wands in time — one of Harry’s hands fastened over his wasted wrist, forcing the wand tips away; the 
knuckles of Harry’s other hand coll ided with the side of Black’s 
head and they fell, back ward, into the wall — 
Hermione was screaming; Ron was yelling; there was a blinding 
flash as the wands in Black’s hand sent a jet of sparks into the air that missed Harry’s face by inch es; Harry felt the shrunken arm 
under his fingers twisting madly, but he clung on, his other hand 
punching every part of Black it could find. 
But Black’s free hand ha d found Harry’s throat — 
“No,” he hissed, “I’ve waited too long —” 
The fingers tightened, Harry choked, his glasses askew. 
 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 341  Then he saw Hermione’s foot swing out of nowhere. Black let go 
of Harry with a grunt of pain; Ron had thrown himself on Black’s 
wand hand and Harry heard a faint clatter — 
He fought free of the tangle of bodies and saw his own wand 
rolling across the floor; he th rew himself toward it but — 
“Argh!” Crookshanks had joined the fray; both sets of front claws had 
sunk themselves deep into Harry’s arm; Harry threw him off, but Crookshanks now darted toward Harry’s wand — 
“NO YOU DON’T!” roared Harry, and he aimed a kick at 
Crookshanks that made the cat leap aside, spitting; Harry snatched 
up his wand and turned — 
“Get out of the way!” he sh outed at Ron and Hermione. 
They didn’t need telling twice. Hermione, gasping for breath, 
her lip bleeding, scrambled asid e, snatching up her and Ron’s 
wands. Ron crawled to the four-poster and collapsed onto it, pant-ing, his white face now tinged with green, both hands clutching his 
broken leg. 
Black was sprawled at the bottom of the wall. His thin chest rose 
and fell rapidly as he watched Ha rry walking slowly nearer, his 
wand pointing straight at Black’s heart. 
“Going to kill me, Harry?” he whispered. Harry stopped right abov e him, his wand still pointing at Black’s 
chest, looking down at him. A livid bruise was rising around 
Black’s left eye and his nose was bleeding. 
“You killed my parents,” said Harry, his voice shaking slightly, 
but his wand hand quite steady. 
Black stared up at him ou t of those sunken eyes. 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 342  “ I d o n ’ t d e n y i t , ” h e s a i d v e r y q u i e t l y . “ B u t i f y o u k n e w t h e 
whole story.” 
“The whole story?” Harry repeated , a furious pounding in his 
ears. “You sold them to Voldemor t. That’s all I need to know.” 
“You’ve got to listen to me,” Blac k said, and there was a note of 
urgency in his voice now. “You’ll re gret it if you don’t. . . . You 
don’t understand. . . .” 
“I understand a lot better than you think,” said Harry, and his 
voice shook more than ever. “You never heard her, did you? My 
mum . . . trying to stop Voldemort killing me . . . and you did 
that . . . you did it. . . .” 
Before either of them could sa y another word, so mething ginger 
streaked past Harry; Crookshanks leapt onto Black’s chest and set-
tled himself there, right over Black’s heart. Black blinked and 
looked down at the cat. 
“Get off,” he murmured, trying to push Crookshanks off him. 
But Crookshanks sank his claws in to Black’s robes and wouldn’t 
shift. He turned his ugly, squashed face to Harry and looked up at 
him with those great yellow eyes. To his right, Hermione gave a dry 
sob. 
Harry stared down at Black and Crookshanks, his grip tighten-
ing on the wand. So what if he had to kill the cat too? It was in 
league with Black. . . . If it was prepared to die, trying to protect 
Black, that wasn’t Harry’s business. . . . If Black wanted to save it, that only proved he cared more for Crookshanks than for Harry’s 
parents. . . . 
Harry raised the wand. Now was the moment to do it. Now was 
the moment to avenge his mother and father. He was going to kill 
Black. He had to kill Black. This was his chance. . . . 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 343  The seconds lengthened. And st ill Harry stood frozen there, 
wand poised, Black staring up at him, Crookshanks on his chest. 
Ron’s ragged breathing came from near the bed; Hermione was quite 
silent. 
And then came a new sound — Muffled footsteps were echoing up through the floor — some-
one was moving downstairs. 
“WE’RE UP HERE!” Hermione screamed suddenly. “WE’RE 
UP HERE — SIRIUS BLACK — QUICK !” 
Black made a startled movement that almost dislodged Crook-
shanks; Harry gripped his wand convulsively — Do it now ! said a 
voice in his head — but the footsteps were thundering up the stairs 
and Harry still hadn’t done it. 
The door of the room burst open in a shower of red sparks and 
Harry wheeled around as Professor Lupin came hurtling into the 
room, his face bloodless, his wand raised and ready. His eyes flick-
ered over Ron, lying on the floor, over Hermione, cowering next to 
the door, to Harry, standing there with his wand covering Black, 
and then to Black himself, crumpl ed and bleeding at Harry’s feet. 
“Expelliarmus !” Lupin shouted. 
Harry’s wand flew once more ou t of his hand; so did the two 
Hermione was holding. Lupin caught them all deftly, then moved into the room, staring at Black, who still had Crookshanks lying 
protectively across his chest. 
Harry stood there, f eeling suddenly empty. He hadn’t done it. 
His nerve had failed him. Black was going to be hand ed back to the 
dementors. 
Then Lupin spoke, in a very tense voice. “Where is he, Sirius?” 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 344  Harry looked quickly at Lupin. He didn’t understand what 
Lupin meant. Who was Lupin talking about? He turned to look at 
Black again. 
Black’s face was quite expressionle ss. For a few seconds, he didn’t 
move at all. Then, very slowly, he raised his empty hand and 
pointed straight at Ron. Mystifie d, Harry glanced around at Ron, 
who looked bewildered. 
“But then . . . ,” Lupin muttered, staring at Black so intently it 
seemed he was trying to read his mind, “. . . why hasn’t he shown 
himself before now? Unless” — Lu pin’s eyes suddenly widened, as 
though he was seeing something beyond Black, something none of 
the rest could see, “— unless he was the one . . . unless you 
switched . . . with out telling me?” 
Very slowly, his sunken gaze ne ver leaving Lupin’s face, Black 
nodded. 
“Professor,” Harry interrupted lo udly, “what’s going on — ?” 
But he never finished the questi on, because what he saw made 
his voice die in his throat. Lupi n was lowering his wand, gazing 
fixedly at Black. The Professor wa lked to Black’s side, seized his 
hand, pulled him to his feet so that Crookshanks fell to the floor, 
and embraced Black like a brother. 
Harry felt as though the bottom had dropped out of his 
stomach. 
“I DON’T BELIEVE IT!” Hermione screamed. 
Lupin let go of Black and turned to her. She had raised herself 
off the floor and was pointing at Lupin, wild-eyed. “You — 
you —” 
“Hermione —” 
 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 345  “ — you and him!” 
“Hermione, calm down —” 
“I didn’t tell anyone!” Hermione shrieked. “I’ve been covering 
up for you —” 
“Hermione, listen to me, please!” Lupin shouted. “I can ex-
plain —” 
Harry could feel himself shaking, not with fear, but with a fresh 
wave of fury. 
“I trusted you,” he shouted at Lupin, his voice wavering out of 
control, “and all the time you’ve been his friend!” 
“You’re wrong,” said Lupin. “I ha ven’t been Sirius’s friend, but I 
am now — Let me explain. . . .” 
“NO!” Hermione screamed. “Harry, don’t trust him, he’s been 
helping Black get into the castle, he wants you dead too — he’s a 
werewolf !” 
There was a ringing silence. Everyone’s eyes were now on Lupin, 
who looked remarkably calm, though rather pale. 
“Not at all up to your usual standard, Hermione,” he said. 
“Only one out of three, I’m afraid. I have no t been helping Sirius 
get into the castle and I certainly don’t want Harry dead. . . .” An 
odd shiver passed over hi s face. “But I won’t de ny that I am a were-
wolf.” 
Ron made a valiant effort to get up again but fell back with a 
whimper of pain. Lupin made toward him, looking concerned, but Ron gasped, 
“Get away from me, werewolf !” 
Lupin stopped dead. Then, with an obvious effort, he turned to 
Hermione and said, “How long have you known?” 
 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 346  “Ages,” Hermione whispered. “Since I did Professor Snape’s es-
say. . . .” 
“He’ll be delighted,” said Lupin coolly. “He assigned that essay 
hoping someone would realize what my symptoms meant. . . . Did 
you check the lunar chart and realize that I was always ill at the full 
moon? Or did you realize that the boggart changed into the moon 
when it saw me?” 
“Both,” Hermione said quietly. Lupin forced a laugh. 
“You’re the cleverest witch of your age I’ve ever met, Hermione.” 
“I’m not,” Hermione whispered. “If I’d been a bit cleverer, I’d 
have told everyone what you are!” 
“But they already know,” said Lupin. “At least, the staff do.” 
“Dumbledore hired you when he knew you were a werewolf?” 
Ron gasped. “Is he mad?” 
“Some of the staff thought so,” said Lupin. “He had to work 
very hard to convince certain te achers that I’m trustworthy —” 
“AND HE WAS WRONG!” Ha rry yelled. “YOU’VE BEEN 
HELPING HIM ALL THE TIME!” He was pointing at Black, 
who suddenly crossed to the four-poster bed and sank onto it, his 
face hidden in one shaking hand. Crookshanks leapt up beside him 
and stepped onto his lap, purring. Ron edged away from both of 
them, dragging his leg. 
“I have not been helping Sirius,” said Lupin. “If you’ll give me a 
chance, I’ll expl ain. Look —” 
He separated Harry’s, Ron’s and Hermione’s wands and threw 
each back to its owner; Harry caught his, stunned. 
“There,” said Lupin, sticking his own wand back into his belt. 
“You’re armed, we’re not. Now will you listen?” 
CAT, RAT, AND DOG 
 347  Harry didn’t know what to think. Was it a trick? 
“If you haven’t been helping him,” he said, with a furious glance 
at Black, “how did yo u know he was here?” 
“The map,” said Lupin. “The Marauder’s Map. I was in my of-
fice examining it —” 
“You know how to work it?” Harry said suspiciously. 
“Of course I know how to work it ,” said Lupin, waving his hand 
impatiently. “I helped write it. I’m Moony — that was my friends’ 
nickname for me at school.” 
“You wrote — ?” 
“The important thing is, I was watching it carefully this evening, 
because I had an idea that you, Ron, and Hermione might try and 
sneak out of the castle to visit Ha grid before his hippogriff was ex-
ecuted. And I was right, wasn’t I?” 
He had started to pace up and down, looking at them. Little 
patches of dust ro se at his feet. 
“You might have been wearing your father’s old cloak, Harry —” 
“How d’you know about the cloak?” 
“The number of times I sa w James disappearing under 
it. . . ,” said Lupin, waving an impatient hand again. “The point 
is, even if you’re wearing an Invisibility Cloak, you still show up on 
the Marauder’s Map. I watched you cross the grounds and enter 
Hagrid’s hut. Twenty minutes later, you left Hagrid, and set off back toward the castle. But you were now accompanied by some-body else.” 
“What?” said Harry. “No, we weren’t!” “I couldn’t believe my eyes,” sa id Lupin, still pacing, and ignor-
ing Harry’s interruption. “I th ought the map mu st be malfunc-
tioning. How could he be with you?” 
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN 
 348  “No one was with us!” said Harry. 
“And then I saw another dot, movi ng fast toward you, labeled 
Sirius Black. . . . I saw him collide with you; I watched as he pulled 
two of you into the Whomping Willow —” 
“One of us!” Ro n said angrily. 
“No, Ron,” said Lupin. “Two of you.” 
He had stopped his pacing, his eyes moving over Ron. 
“Do you think I could have a look at the rat?” he said evenly. 
“What?” said Ron. “What’s Sca bbers got to do with it?” 
“Everything,” said Lupin. “Could I see him, please?” Ron hesitated, then put a hand inside his robes. Scabbers 
emerged, thrashing desperately; Ron had to seize his long bald tail 
to stop him escaping. Crookshan ks stood up on Black’s leg and 
made a soft hissing noise. 
Lupin moved closer to Ron. He s eemed to be holding his breath 
as he gazed intently at Scabbers. 
“What?” Ron said again, holding Scabbers close to him, looking 
scared. “What’s my rat got to do with anything?” 
“That’s not a rat,” croaked Sirius Black suddenly. 
“What d’you mean — of course he’s a rat —” 
“No, he’s not,” said Lupin quietly. “He’s a wizard.” 
“An Animagus,” said Black, “by the name of Peter Pettigrew.”

t took a few seconds for the absurd ity of this statement to sink 
in. Then Ron voiced what Harry was thinking. 
“You’re both mental.” 
“Ridiculous!” said Hermione faintly. “Peter Pettigrew’s dead!” said Harry. “ He killed him twelve years 
ago!” He pointed at Black, whos e face twitched convulsively. 
“I meant to,” he growled, his yellow teeth bared, “but little Peter 
got the better of me . . . not this time, though!” 
And Crookshanks was thrown to the floor as Black lunged at 
Scabbers; Ron yelled with pain as Black’s weight fell on his broken 
leg. 
“Sirius, NO!” Lupin yelled, la unching himself forwards and 
dragging Black away from Ron again, “WAIT! You can’t do it just 
like that — they need to understand — we’ve got to explain —” 
“We can explain afterwards!” snarled Black, trying to throw 
 I 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 350  Lupin off. One hand was still claw ing the air as it tried to reach 
Scabbers, who was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face and 
neck as he tried to escape. 
“They’ve — got — a — right — to — know — everything!” 
Lupin panted, still trying to restra in Black. “Ron’s kept him as a 
pet! There are parts of it even I don’t understand! And Harry — 
you owe Harry the truth, Sirius!” 
Black stopped struggling, though hi s hollowed eyes were still fixed 
on Scabbers, who was clamped tightly under Ron’s bitten, scratched, 
and bleeding hands. 
“All right, then,” Black said, without taking his eyes off the rat. 
“Tell them whatever you like. But ma ke it quick, Remus. I want to 
commit the murder I was imprisoned for. . . .” 
“You’re nutters, both of you,” sa id Ron shakily, looking round at 
Harry and Hermione for support. “I’ve had enough of this. I’m 
off.” 
He tried to heave himself up on his good leg, bu t Lupin raised 
his wand again, pointing it at Scabbers. 
“You’re going to hear me out, Ron,” he said quietly. “Just keep a 
tight hold on Peter while you listen.” 
“HE’S NOT PETER, HE’S SCABBE RS!” Ron yelled, trying to 
force the rat back into his front pocket, but Scabbers was fighting 
too hard; Ron swayed and overba lanced, and Harry caught him 
and pushed him back down to the bed. Then, ignoring Black, 
Harry turned to Lupin. 
“There were witnesses who saw Pe ttigrew die,” he said. “A whole 
street full of them . . .” 
 
 
MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS 
 351  “They didn’t see what they thou ght they saw!” said Black sav-
agely, still watching Scabbers struggling in Ron’s hands. 
“Everyone thought Sirius killed Pe ter,” said Lupin, nodding. “I 
believed it myself — until I saw the map tonight. Because the Ma-
rauder’s map never lies . . . Peter’ s alive. Ron’s holding him, Harry.” 
Harry looked down at Ron, and as their eyes met, they agreed, 
silently: Black and Lupin were both out of their minds. Their story made no sense whatsoever. How could Scabbers be Peter Pettigrew? 
Azkaban must have unhinged Black after all — but why was Lupin 
playing along with him? 
Then Hermione spoke, in a trembl i n g , w o u l d - b e c a l m s o r t o f 
voice, as though trying to will Professor Lupin to talk sensibly. 
“But Professor Lupin . . . Scabbers can’t be Pettigrew . . . it just 
can’t be true, you kn ow it can’t . . .” 
“Why can’t it be true?” Lupin said calmly, as though they were in 
class, and Hermione had simply spotted a problem in an experi-
ment with grindylows. 
“Because . . . because people would know if Peter Pettigrew 
had been an Animagus. We did An imagi in class with Professor 
McGonagall. And I looked them up when I did my homework — 
the Ministry of Magic keeps tabs on witches and wizards who can 
become animals; there’s a register showing what animal they be-
come, and their markings and thin gs . . . and I went and looked 
Professor McGonagall up on the register, and there have been only seven Animagi this century, and Pettigrew’s name wasn’t on the 
list —” 
Harry had barely had time to ma rvel inwardly at the effort 
Hermione put into her homework, when Lupin started to laugh. 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 352  “Right again, Hermione!” he said . “But the Ministry never knew 
that there used to be three unregistered Animagi running around 
Hogwarts.” 
“If you’re going to tell them th e story, get a move on, Remus,” 
snarled Black, who was still watching Scabbers’s every desper-ate move. “I’ve waited twelve year s, I’m not going to wait much 
longer.” 
“All right . . . but you’ll need to help me, Sirius,” said Lupin, “I 
only know how it began . . .” 
Lupin broke off. There had been a loud creak behind him. The 
bedroom door had opened of its own accord. All five of them 
stared at it. Then Lupin strode to ward it and looked out into the 
landing. 
“No one there . . .” 
“This place is haunted!” said Ron. 
“It’s not,” said Lupin, still looking at the door in a puzzled way. 
“The Shrieking Shack was never haunted. . . . The screams and 
howls the villagers used to hear were made by me.” 
He pushed his graying hair out of his eyes, thought for a mo-
ment, then said, “That’s where all of this starts — with my becom-
ing a werewolf. None of this could have happened if I hadn’t been 
bitten . . . and if I hadn’t been so foolhardy. . . .” 
He looked sober and tired. Ro n started to interrupt, but Her-
mione said, “Shh!” She was wa tching Lupin very intently. 
“I was a very small boy when I received the bite. My parents 
tried everything, but in those days there was no cure. The potion that Professor Snape has been maki ng for me is a very recent dis-
covery. It makes me safe, you see. As long as I take it in the week

 353  preceding the full moon, I keep my mind when I transform. . . . I 
am able to curl up in my office , a harmless wolf, and wait for the 
moon to wane again. 
“Before the Wolfsbane Potion wa s discovered, however, I be-
came a fully fledged monster once a month. It seem ed impossible 
that I would be able to come to Hogwarts. Other parents weren’t 
likely to want their children exposed to me. 
“But then Dumbledore became Headmaster, and he was sympa-
thetic. He said that as long as we took certain precautions, there 
was no reason I shouldn’t come to school. . . .” Lupin sighed, and 
looked directly at Harry. “I told you, months ago, that the Whomp-
ing Willow was planted the year I came to Hogwarts. The truth is that it was planted because I c a m e t o H o g w a r t s . T h i s h o u s e ” — 
Lupin looked miserably around the room, — “the tunnel that l e a d s t o i t — t h e y w e r e b u i l t f o r m y u s e . O n c e a m o n t h , I w a s 
smuggled out of the castle, into th is place, to transform. The tree 
was placed at the tunnel mouth to stop anyone coming across me 
while I was dangerous.” 
Harry couldn’t see where this stor y was going, but he was listen-
ing raptly all the same. The only sound apart from Lupin’s voice 
was Scabbers’s frightened squeaking. 
“My transformations in those days were — were terrible. It is 
very painful to turn into a werewolf. I was separated from humans to bite, so I bit and scratched myself instead. The villagers heard the noise and the screaming and thought they were hearing partic-
ularly violent spirits. Dumbledore encouraged the rumor. . . . Even 
now, when the house has been sil ent for years, the villagers don’t 
dare approach it. . . . 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 354  “But apart from my transformations, I was happier than I had 
ever been in my life. For the first time ever , I had friends, three 
great friends. Sirius Black . . . Peter Pettigrew . . . and, of course, 
your father, Harr y — James Potter. 
“Now, my three friends could hardly fail to notice that I disap-
peared once a month. I made up all sorts of stories. I told them my m o t h e r w a s i l l , a n d t h a t I h a d t o g o h o m e t o s e e h e r . . . . I w a s 
terrified they would desert me the moment they found out what 
I was. But of course, they, like you, Hermione, worked out the 
truth. . . . 
“And they didn’t desert me at al l. Instead, they did something for 
me that would make my transformations not only bearable, but the best times of my life. They became Animagi.” 
“My dad too?” said Harry, astounded. “Yes, indeed,” said Lupin. “It took them the best part of three 
years to work out how to do it. Your father and Sirius here were the 
cleverest students in the school, and lucky they were, because the 
Animagus transformation can go horribly wrong — one reason the 
Ministry keeps a close watch on those attempting to do it. Peter 
needed all the help he could get from James an d Sirius. Finally, in 
our fifth year, they managed it. They could each turn into a differ-
ent animal at will.” 
“But how did that help you?” sa id Hermione, sounding puzzled. 
“They couldn’t keep me company as humans, so they kept me 
company as animals,” said Lupin. “A werewolf is only a danger to 
people. They sneaked out of the castle every month under James’s 
Invisibility Cloak. They transformed . . . Peter, as the smallest, 
could slip beneath the Willow’s attacking branches and touch the 
knot that freezes it. They would then slip down the tunnel and join 
MOODY, WORMTAIL, PADFOOT, AND PRONGS 
 355  me. Under their influence, I beca me less dangerous. My body was 
still wolfish, but my mind seemed to become less so while I was 
with them.” 
“Hurry up, Remus,” snarled Black, who was still watching Scab-
bers with a horrible sort of hunger on his face. 
“I’m getting there, Sirius, I’m ge tting there . . . well, highly ex-
citing possibilities were open to us now that we could all transform. 
Soon we were leaving the Shriek ing Shack and roaming the school 
grounds and the village by night. Sirius and James transformed into 
such large animals, they were able to keep a werewolf in check. 
I doubt whether any Hogwarts stud ents ever found out more about 
the Hogwarts grounds and Hogsmeade than we did. . . . And that’s 
how we came to write the Marauder ’ s M a p , a n d s i g n i t w i t h o u r 
nicknames. Sirius is Padfoot. Pete r is Wormtail. James was Prongs.” 
“What sort of animal — ?” Harry began, but Hermione cut him 
off. 
“That was still really dangerous! Running around in the dark 
with a werewolf! What if you’d given the others the slip, and bitten 
somebody?” 
“A thought that still haunts me,” said Lupin heavily. “And there

“I sometimes felt guilty about be traying Dumbledore’s trust, of

master would have done so, and he had no idea I was breaking the rules he had set down for my own and others’ safety. He never 
knew I had led three fellow student s into becoming Animagi ille-
gally. But I always managed to forget my guilty feelings every time 
CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 
 356  we sat down to plan our next month’s adventure. And I haven’t 
changed . . . 
Lupin’s face had hardened, and there was self-disgust in his voice. 
“All this year, I have been battli ng with myself, wondering whether 
I should tell Dumbledore that Siri us was an Animag us. But I didn’t 
do it. Why? Because I was too co wardly. It would have meant 
admitting that I’d betr ayed his trust while I was at school, admit-
ting that I’d led others along wi th me . . . and Dumbledore’s trust 
has meant everything to me. He let me into Hogwarts as a boy, and 
he gave me a job when I have been shunned all my adult life, un-
able to find paid work because of what I am. And so I convinced 
myself that Sirius was getting into the school using dark arts he 
learned from Voldemort, that being an Animagus had nothing 
to do with it . . . so, in a way, Snape’s been right about me all 
along.” 
“Snape?” said Black harshly, taking his eyes off Scabbers for the 
first time in minutes and looking up at Lupin. “W hat’s Snape got 
to do with it?” 
“He’s here, Sirius,” said Lupin he avily. “He’s teaching here as 
well.” He looked up at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. 
“Professor Snape was at school with us. He fought very hard 
against my appointment to the De fense Against the Dark Arts job. 
He has been telling Dumbledore a ll year that I am not to be 
trusted. He has his reasons . . . yo u see, Sirius here played a trick 
on him which nearly killed him, a trick which involved me —”

Lupin told Harry, Ron, and Hermio ne. “We were in the same year, 
you know, and we — er — didn’t like each other very much. He 
especially disliked James. Jealous, I think, of James’s talent on the 
Quidditch field . . . anyway Snape had seen me crossing the 
grounds with Madam Pomfrey one evening as she led me toward 
the Whomping Willow to transform. Sirius thought it would be — 
er — amusing, to tell Snape all he had to do was prod the knot on the tree trunk with a long stick, an d he’d be able to get in after me. 
Well, of course, Snape tried it — if he ’d got as far as this house, he’d 
have met a fully grown werewolf — but your father, who’d heard what Sirius had done, went afte r Snape and pulled him back, at 
great risk to his life . . . Snape gl impsed me, though, at the end of 
the tunnel. He was forbidden by Dumbledore to tell anybody, but 
from that time on he knew what I was. . . .” 
“So that’s why Snape doesn’t li ke you,” said Harry slowly, “be-

Snape was slightly breathless, but his face was full of suppressed 
triumph. “You’re wondering, perhaps, how I knew you were here?” 
he said, his eyes glittering. “I’ve ju st been to your office, Lupin. You

gleaming fanatically. “I shall be interested to see how Dumbledore 
takes this. . . . He was quite convinced you were harmless, you 
know, Lupin . . . a tame werewolf —” 
“You fool,” said Lupin softly . “Is a schoolboy grudge worth 
putting an innocent man back inside Azkaban?” 
BANG! Thin, snakelike cords bu rst from the en d of Snape’s 
wand and twisted themselves around Lupin’s mouth, wrists, and ankles; he overbalanced and fell to the floor, unable to move. With 
a roar of rage, Black started toward Snape, but Snape pointed his wand straight between Black’s eyes. 
“Give me a reason,” he whispered. “Give me a reason to do it, 
and I swear I will.” 
Black stopped dead. It would have been impossible to say which 
face showed more hatred. 
Harry stood there, paralyzed, not knowing what to do or whom 
to believe. He glance d around at Ron and Hermione. Ron looked 
just as confused as he did, still fi ghting to keep hold on the strug-
gling Scabbers. Hermione, however, took an uncertain step toward 
Snape and said, in a very breathle ss voice, “Professor Snape — it — 
it wouldn’t hurt to hear what they’ve got to say, w — would it?” 
“Miss Granger, you are already facing suspension from this 
school,” Snape spat. “You, Potter, and Weasley are out-of-bounds, 
 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 360  in the company of a convicted mu rderer and a werewolf. For once 
in your life, hold your tongue. ” 
“But if — if there was a mistake —” 
“KEEP QUIET, YOU STUPID GIRL!” Snape shouted, looking 
suddenly quite deranged. “DON’T TALK ABOUT WHAT YOU DON’T UNDERSTAND!” A few sparks shot out of the end of his 
wand, which was still pointed at Black’s face. Hermione fell silent. 
“Vengeance is very sweet,” Snape breathed at Black. “How I 
hoped I would be the one to catch you. . . .” 
“The joke’s on you again, Severu s,” Black snarled. “As long as 
this boy brings his rat up to the castle” — he jerked his head at 
Ron — “I’ll come quietly. . . .” 
“Up to the castle?” said Snape silkily. “I don’t think we need to 
go that far. All I have to do is ca ll the dementors once we get out of 
the Willow. They’ll be very pleased to see you, Black . . . pleased enough to give you a little kiss, I daresay. . . .” 
What little color there was in Black’s face left it. 
“You — you’ve got to hear me out,” he croaked. “The rat — 
look at the rat —” 
But there was a mad glint in Sn ape’s eyes that Harry had never 
seen before. He seem ed beyond reason. 
“Come on, all of you,” he said. He clicked his fingers, and the 
ends of the cords that bound Lupin fl ew to his hands. “I’ll drag the 
werewolf. Perhaps the dementors will have a kiss for him too —” 
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry had crossed the room 
in three strides an d blocked the door. 
“Get out of the way, Potter, you’re in enough trouble already,” 
snarled Snape. “If I hadn’t been here to save your skin —” 
 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 361  “Professor Lupin could have kill ed me about a hundred times 
this year,” Harry said. “I’ve been alone with him loads of times, 
having defense lessons against th e dementors. If he was helping 
Black, why didn’t he just finish me off then?” 
“Don’t ask me to fathom the way a werewolf’s mind works,” 
hissed Snape. “Get ou t of the way, Potter.” 
“YOU’RE PATHETIC!” Harr y yelled. “JUST BECAUSE 
THEY MADE A FOOL OF YO U AT SCHOOL YOU WON’T 
EVEN LISTEN —” 
“SILENCE! I WILL NOT BE SP OKEN TO LIKE THAT!” 
Snape shrieked, looking madder than ever. “Like father, like son, 
Potter! I have just saved your neck; you should be thanking me on 
bended knee! You would have been well served if he’d killed you! 
You’d have died like your father, too arrogant to believe you might 
be mistaken in Black — now get out of the way, or I will make you. 
GET OUT OF THE WAY, POTTER!” 
Harry made up his mind in a sp lit second. Before Snape could 
take even one step toward him, he had raised his wand. 
“Expelliarmus !” he yelled — except that his wasn ’ t the only voice 
that shouted. There was a blast th at made the door rattle on its 
hinges; Snape was lifted off his feet and slammed into the wall, 
then slid down it to the floor, a trickle of blood oozing from under 
his hair. He had been knocked out. 
Harry looked around. Both Ro n and Hermione had tried to 
disarm Snape at exactl y the same moment. Snape’s wand soared in 
a high arc and landed on th e bed next to Crookshanks. 
“You shouldn’t have done that,” said Black, looking at Harry. 
“You should have left him to me. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 362  Harry avoided Black’s eyes. He wasn’t sure, even now, that he’d 
done the right thing. 
“We attacked a teacher. . . . We attacked a teacher . . . ,” Her-
mione whimpered, star ing at the lifeless Snape with frightened 
eyes. “Oh, we’re going to be in so much trouble —” 
Lupin was struggling against his bonds. Black bent down 
quickly and untied him . Lupin straightened up, rubbing his arms 
where the ropes had cut into them. 
“Thank you, Harry,” he said. 
“I’m still not saying I believe you,” he told Lupin. 
“Then it’s time we offered you some proof,” said Lupin. “You, 
boy — give me Peter, please. Now.” 
Ron clutched Scabbers closer to his chest. “Come off it,” he said weakly. “Are you trying to say he broke out 
of Azkaban just to get his hands on Scabbers ? I mean . . .” He looked 
up at Harry and Hermione for support, “Okay, say Pettigrew could turn into a rat — there are millions of rats — how’s he supposed to 
know which one he’s after if he was locked up in Azkaban?” 
“You know, Sirius, that’s a fair qu estion,” said Lupin, turning to 
Black and frowning slightly. “How did you find out where he was?” 
Black put one of his clawlike hands inside his robes and took out 
a crumpled piece of paper, which he smoothed flat and held out to 
show the others. 
It was the photograph of Ron an d his family that had appeared 
in the Daily Prophet the previous summer, and there, on Ron’s 
shoulder, was Scabbers. 
“How did you get this?” Lupin asked Black, thunderstruck. 
“Fudge,” said Black. “When he came to inspect Azkaban last 
 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 363  year, he gave me his paper. And there was Peter, on the front 
page . . . on this boy’s shoulder. . . . I knew him at once . . . how 
many times had I seen him transform? And the caption said the 
boy would be going back to Hogwarts . . . to where Harry was. . . .” 
“My God,” said Lupin softly, star ing from Scabbers to the pic-
ture in the paper and back again. “His front paw . . .” 
“What about it?” said Ron defiantly. “He’s got a toe missing,” said Black. 
“Of course,” Lupin breath ed. “So simple . . . so brilliant . . . he 
cut it off himself?” 
“Just before he transformed,” sa id Black. “When I cornered him, 
he yelled for the whole street to hear that I’d betrayed Lily and 
James. Then, before I could curse him, he blew apart the street 
with the wand behind his back, killed everyone within twenty feet 
of himself — and sped down into the sewer with the other rats. . . . 
“Didn’t you ever hear, Ron?” said Lupin. “The biggest bit of 
Peter they found was his finger.” 
“Look, Scabbers probably had a fi ght with another rat or some-
thing! He’s been in my family for ages, right —” 
“Twelve years, in fact,” said Lu pin. “Didn’t you ever wonder why 
he was living so long?” 
“We — we’ve been taking good care of him!” said Ron. 
“Not looking too good at the moment, though, is he?” said 
Lupin. “I’d guess he’s been losing weight ever since he heard Sirius 
was on the loose again. . . .” 
“He’s been scared of that mad cat!” said Ron, nodding toward 
Crookshanks, who was stil l purring on the bed. 
 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 364  But that wasn’t right, Harry thought suddenly. . . . Scabbers 
had been looking ill before he met Crookshanks . . . ever since 
Ron’s return from Egypt . . . since the time when Black had es-
caped. . . . 
“This cat isn’t mad,” said Black hoarsely. He reached out a bony 
hand and stroked Crookshanks’s fl uffy head. “He’s the most intel-
ligent of his kind I’ve ever met. He recognized Peter for what he 
was right away. And when he met me, he knew I was no dog. It was a while before he trusted me. . . . Finally, I managed to communi-
cate to him what I was after, and he’s been helping me. . . .” 
“What do you mean?” breathed Hermione. “He tried to bring Peter to me, bu t couldn’t . . . so he stole the 
passwords into Gryffindor Tower for me. . . . As I understand it, he 
took them from a boy’s bedside table. . . .” 
Harry’s brain seemed to be saggin g under the weight of what he 
was hearing. It was absu rd . . . and yet . . . 
“But Peter got wind of what was going on and ran for it. . . .” 
croaked Black. “This cat — Crookshanks, did you call him? — 
told me Peter had left blood on the sh eets. . . . I supposed he bit 
himself. . . . Well, fa king his own death had worked once. . . .” 
These words jolted Harry to his senses. 
“And why did he fake his death?” he said furiously. “Because he 
knew you were about to kill him like you killed my parents!” 
“No,” said Lupin, “Harry —” “And now you’ve come to finish him off!” 
“Yes, I have,” said Black, with an evil look at Scabbers. 
“Then I should’ve let Snape take you!” Harry shouted. 
“Harry,” said Lupin hurriedly, “don’t you see? All this time 
 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 365  we’ve thought Sirius betrayed your parents, and Peter tracked him 
down — but it was the other way around, don’t you see? Peter be-
trayed your mother and father — Sirius tracked Peter down —” 
“THAT’S NOT TRUE!” Harr y yelled. “HE WAS THEIR 
SECRET-KEEPER! HE SAID SO BEFORE YOU TURNED UP. 
HE SAID HE KILLED THEM!” 
He was pointing at Black, who shook his head slowly; the 
sunken eyes were su ddenly overbright. 
“Harry . . . I as good as killed them,” he croaked. “I persuaded 
Lily and James to change to Peter at the last moment, persuaded them to use him as Secr et-Keeper instead of me . . . . I’m to blame, 
I know it. . . . The night they died, I’d arranged to check on Peter, 
make sure he was still safe, but when I arrived at his hiding place, 
he’d gone. Yet there was no sign of a struggle. It didn’t feel right. I was scared. I set out for your pa rents’ house straight away. And 
when I saw their house, destroyed, and their bodies . . . I realized 
what Peter must’ve done . . . what I’d done. . . .” 
His voice broke. He turned away. 
“Enough of this,” said Lupin, and there was a steely note in his 
voice Harry had never heard before. “There’s one certain way to 
prove what really happened. Ron, give me that rat. ” 
“What are you going to do with hi m if I give him to you?” Ron 
asked Lupin tensely. 
“Force him to show himself,” said Lu pin. “If he really is a rat, it 
won’t hurt him.” 
Ron hesitated. Then at long la st, he held out Scabbers and 
Lupin took him. Scabbers began to squeak without stopping, 
twisting and turning, his tiny black eyes bulging in his head. 
 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 366  “Ready, Sirius?” said Lupin. 
Black had already retrieved Snape’s wand from the bed. He ap-
proached Lupin and the struggling rat, and his wet eyes suddenly 
seemed to be burning in his face. 
“Together?” he said quietly. 
“I think so,” said Lupin, holdin g Scabbers tightly in one hand 
and his wand in the other. “On the count of three. One — two — 
THREE!” 
A flash of blue-white light erupte d from both wands; for a mo-
ment, Scabbers was frozen in midair, his small gray form twisting madly — Ron yelled — the rat fell and hit the floor. There was an-
other blinding flash of light and then — 
It was like watching a speeded-up film of a growing tree. A head 
was shooting upward from the gr ound; limbs were sprouting; a 
moment later, a man was standing where Scabbers had been, cring-
ing and wringing his hands. Crookshanks was spitting and snarling on the bed; the hair on his back was standing up. 
He was a very short man, ha rdly taller than Harry and 
Hermione. His thin, colorless ha ir was unkempt and there was a 
large bald patch on top. He ha d the shrunken appearance of a 
plump man who has lost a lot of we ight in a short time. His skin 
looked grubby, almost like Scabbers ’s fur, and something of the rat 
lingered around his pointed nose and his very small, watery eyes. 
He looked around at them all, his breathing fast and shallow. 
Harry saw his eyes dart to the door and back again. 
“Well, hello, Peter,” said Lupin pleasantly, as though rats fre-
quently erupted into old school friends ar ound him. “Long time, 
no see.” 
“S — Sirius . . . R — Remus . . .” Even Pettigrew’s voice was 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 367  squeaky. Again, his eyes darted toward the door. “My friends . . . 
my old friends . . .” 
Black’s wand arm rose, but Lupin seized him around the wrist, 
gave him a warning look, then turned again to Pettigrew, his voice 
light and casual. 
“We’ve been having a little chat , Peter, about what happened the 
night Lily and James died. You mi ght have missed the finer points 
while you were squeaking around down there on the bed —” 
“Remus,” gasped Pettigrew, and Harry could see beads of sweat 
breaking out over his pasty face, “you don’t believe him, do 
you. . . ? He tried to kill me, Remus. . . .” 
“So we’ve heard,” said Lupin, more coldly. “I’d like to clear up 
one or two little matter s with you, Peter, if you’d be so —” 
“He’s come to try and kill me again!” Pettigrew squeaked sud-
denly, pointing at Black, and Harry saw that he used his middle 
finger, because his index was miss ing. “He killed Lily and James 
and now he’s going to kill me t oo. . . . You’ve got to help me, 
Remus. . . .” 
Black’s face looked more skull-like than ever as he stared at 
Pettigrew with hi s fathomless eyes. 
“No one’s going to tr y and kill you until we’ve sorted a few 
things out,” said Lupin. 
“Sorted things out?” squealed Pe ttigrew, looking wildly about 
him once more, eyes taking in th e boarded windows and, again, the 
only door. “I knew he’d come after me! I knew he’d be back for me! 
I’ve been waiting for th is for twelve years!” 
“You knew Sirius was going to break out of Azkaban?” said 
Lupin, his brow furrowed. “When nobody has ever done it be-
fore?” 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 368  “He’s got dark powers the rest of us can only dream of!” Petti-
grew shouted shrilly. “How else did he get out of there? I suppose 
He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named ta ught him a fe w tricks!” 
Black started to laugh, a horrible, mirthless laugh that filled the 
whole room. 
“Voldemort, teach me tricks?” he said. 
Pettigrew flinched as though Black had br andished a whip at 
him. 
“ W h a t , s c a r e d t o h e a r y o u r o l d master’s name?” said Black. “I 
don’t blame you, Peter. His lot ar en’t very happy with you, are 
they?” 
“Don’t know what you mean, Siri us —” muttered Pettigrew, his 
breathing faster than ever. His wh ole face was shining with sweat 
now. 
“You haven’t been hiding from me for twelve years,” said Black. 
“You’ve been hiding from Voldemort’s old supporters. I heard things in Azkaban, Peter. . . . They all th ink you’re dead, or you’d have to 
answer to them. . . . I’ve heard them screaming all sorts of things in 
their sleep. Sounds like they think the double-crosser double-crossed 
them. Voldemort went to the Potters’ on your information . . . and 
Voldemort met his downfall there. And not all Voldemort’s support-
ers ended up in Azkaban, did they ? There are still plenty out here, 
biding their time, pretending they’ve seen the error of their ways. . . . 
If they ever got wind that yo u were still alive, Peter —” 
“Don’t know . . . what you’re talk ing about. . . ,” said Pettigrew 
again, more shrilly than ever. He wiped his face on his sleeve and 
looked up at Lupin. “You don’t believe th is — this madness, 
Remus —” 
 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 369  “I must admit, Peter, I have difficulty in understanding why an 
innocent man would want to spen d twelve years as a rat,” said 
Lupin evenly. 
“Innocent, but scared!” squealed Pettigrew. “If Voldemort’s sup-
porters were after me, it was becaus e I put one of their best men in 
Azkaban — the spy, Sirius Black!” 
Black’s face contorted. 
“How dare you,” he growled, so unding suddenly like the bear-
sized dog he had been. “I, a spy for Voldemort? When did I ever 
sneak around people who were st ronger and more powerful than 
myself? But you, Peter — I’ll ne ver understand why I didn’t see 
you were the spy from the start. You always liked big friends who’d 
look after you, didn’t you? It used to be us . . . me and Remus . . . 
and James. . . .” 
Pettigrew wiped his face again; he was almost panting for breath. 
“Me, a spy . . . must be out of your mind . . . never . . . don’t 
know how you can say such a —” 
“Lily and James only made yo u Secret-Keeper because I sug-
gested it,” Black hissed, so venomo usly that Pettig rew took a step 
backward. “I thought it was the perfect plan . . . a bluff. . . . Volde-
mort would be sure to come af ter me, would never dream they’d 
use a weak, talentless th ing like you. . . . It must have been the 
finest moment of your miserable life, telling Voldemort you could 
hand him the Potters.” 
Pettigrew was muttering distract edly; Harry caught words like 
“far-fetched” and “lunacy,” but he couldn’t help paying more at-tention to the ashen color of Pett igrew’s face and the way his eyes 
continued to dart toward the windows and door. 
 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 370  “Professor Lupin?” said Hermione timidly. “Can — can I say 
something?” 
“Certainly, Hermione,” said Lupin courteously. 
“Well — Scabbers — I mean, this — this man — he’s been sleep-
ing in Harry’s dormitory for three years. If he’s working for You-
Know-Who, how come he never tried to hurt Harry before now?” 
“There!” said Pettigrew shrilly, pointing at Ron with his maimed 
hand. “Thank you! You see, Remus? I have never hurt a hair of 
Harry’s head! Why should I?” 
“I’ll tell you why,” said Black. “Because you never did anything 
for anyone unless you could see what was in it for you. Voldemort’s been in hiding for fifteen years, they say he’s half dead. You weren’t 
about to commit murder right under Albus Dumbledore’s nose, for 
a wreck of a wizard who’d lost al l of his power, were you? You’d 
want to be quite sure he was the biggest bully in the playground be-
fore you went back to him, wouldn ’t you? Why else did you find a 
wizard family to take you in? Ke eping an ear out for news, weren’t 
you, Peter? Just in case your old protector regained strength, and it 
was safe to rejoin him. . . .” 
Pettigrew opened his mouth and cl osed it several times. He 
seemed to have lost the ability to talk. 
“Er — Mr. Black — Sirius?” said Hermione. 
Black jumped at being addresse d like this and stared at 
Hermione as though he had never seen anything quite like her. 
“If you don’t mind me asking, how — how did you get out of 
Azkaban, if you didn’t use Dark Magic?” 
“Thank you!” gasped Pettigrew, nodding frantically at her. “Ex-
actly! Precisely what I —” 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 371  But Lupin silenced him with a l ook. Black was frowning slightly 
at Hermione, but not as though he were annoyed with her. He 
seemed to be pondering his answer. 
“I don’t know how I did it,” he said slowly. “I think the only rea-
son I never lost my mind is that I knew I was innocent. That wasn’t 
a happy thought, so the dementors co uldn’t suck it out of me . . . 
but it kept me sane and knowing who I am . . . helped me keep my 
powers . . . so when it all became . . . too much . . . I could trans-
form in my cell . . . become a dog. Dementors can’t see, you know. . . .” He swallowed. “They feel their way toward people by 
feeding off their emotions. . . . They could tell that my feelings were less — less human, less complex when I was a dog . . . but they 
thought, of course, that I was losing my mind like everyone 
else in there, so it didn’t trou ble them. But I wa s weak, very weak, 
a n d I h a d n o h o p e o f d r i v i n g t h e m a w a y f r o m m e w i t h o u t a wand. . . . 
“But then I saw Peter in that picture . . . I realized he was at 
Hogwarts with Harry . . . perfectly positioned to act, if one hint 
reached his ears that the Dark Side was gathering strength 
again. . . .” 
Pettigrew was shaking his head, mouthing noiselessly, but star-
ing all the while at Blac k as though hypnotized. 
“. . . ready to strike at the moment he could be sure of allies . . . 
and to deliver the last Potter to th em. If he gave them Harry, who’d 
dare say he’d betrayed Lord Voldemort? He’d be welcomed back 
with honors. . . . 
“So you see, I had to do something. I was the only one who 
knew Peter was still alive. . . .” 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 372  Harry remembered what Mr. Weas ley had told Mrs. Weasley. 
“The guards say he’s been talking in his sleep . . . always the same 
words . . . ‘ He’s at Hogwarts.’” 
“It was as if someone had lit a fire in my head, and the dementors 
couldn’t destroy it. . . . It wasn’t a happy feeling . . . it was an obses-
sion . . . but it gave me strength, it cleared my mind. So, one night 
when they opened my door to bring food, I slipped pa st them as a 
dog. . . . It’s so much harder for th em to sense animal emotions that 
they were confused. . . . I was thin, very thin . . . thin enough to slip 
through the bars. . . . I swam as a dog back to the mainland. . . . I 
journeyed north and slipped into the Hogwarts grounds as a dog. I’ve been living in the forest ever since, except when I came to watch the 
Quidditch, of course. You fly as well as your father did, Harry. . . .” 
He looked at Harry, who did not look away. 
“Believe me,” croaked Black. “Believe me, Harry. I never 
betrayed James and Lily. I would have died before I betrayed them.” 
And at long last, Harry believed him. Throat too tight to speak, 
he nodded. 
“No!” 
Pettigrew had fallen to his knees as though Harry’s nod had been 
his own death sentence. He shuffled forward on his knees, grovel-
ing, his hands clasped in front of him as th ough praying. 
“Sirius — it’s me . . . it’s Peter . . . your fri end . . . you wouldn’t . . .” 
Black kicked out and Pettigrew recoiled. 
“There’s enough filth on my robes without you touching them,” 
said Black. 
“Remus!” Pettigrew squeaked, turning to Lupin instead, writh-
ing imploringly in front of him. “You don’t believe this . . . 
wouldn’t Sirius have told you they’d changed the plan?” 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 373  “Not if he thought I was the spy, Peter,” said Lupin. “I assume 
that’s why you didn’t tell me, Siri us?” he said casually over Petti-

“Forgive me, Remus,” said Black. 
“Not at all, Padfoot, old frie nd,” said Lupin, who was now 
rolling up his sleeves. “And will yo u, in turn, forgive me for believ-
ing you were the spy?” 
“Of course,” said Black, and the ghost of a grin flitted across his 
gaunt face. He, too, began rolling up his sleeves. “Shall we kill him 
together?” 
“Yes, I think so,” said Lupin grimly. 
“You wouldn’t . . . you won’t. . . ,” gasped Pettigrew. And he 
scrambled around to Ron. 
“Ron . . . haven’t I been a good fr iend . . . a good pet? You won’t 
let them kill me, Ron, will you . . . you’re on my side, aren’t 
you?” 
But Ron was staring at Pettigrew with the utmost revulsion. 
“I let you sleep in my bed !” he said. 
“Kind boy . . . kind master . . .” Pettigrew crawled toward Ron, 
“you won’t let them do it. . . . I was your rat. . . . I was a good 
pet. . . .” 
“If you made a better rat than a human, it’s not much to boast 
about, Peter,” said Black harshly. Ron, going still paler with pain, 
wrenched his broken leg out of Pettigr ew’s reach. Pettigrew turned on 
his knees, staggered forward, and seized the hem of Hermione’s robes. 
“Sweet girl . . . clever girl . . . you — you won’t let them. . . . 
Help me. . . .” 
Hermione pulled her robes out of Pettigre w’s clutching hands 
and backed away against the wall, looking horrified.

“HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO HARRY?” roared Black. 
“ H O W D A R E Y O U F A C E H I M ? H O W D A R E Y O U T A L K

“Harry,” whispered Pettigrew, shuffling toward him, hands out-

Both Black and Lupin strode forward, seized Pettigrew’s shoul-

ing with terror, staring up at them. 
“You sold Lily and James to Vo ldemort,” said Black, who was 
shaking too. “Do you deny it?” 
Pettigrew burst into tears. It was horrible to watch, like an over-

“Sirius, Sirius, what could I have done? The Dark Lord . . . you

HAVE DONE FOR YOU!” 
Black and Lupin stood shoulder to shoulder, wands raised. 
“You should have realized,” said Lupin quietly, “if Voldemort 
didn’t kill you, we wo uld. Good-bye, Peter.” 
Hermione covered her face with her hands and turned to the 
wall. 
“NO!” Harry yelled. He ran forward, placing himself in front of 
Pettigrew, facing the wands. “You can’t kill him,” he said breath-
lessly. “You can’t.” 
Black and Lupin both looked staggered. 
“Harry, this piece of vermin is the reason you have no parents,” 
Black snarled. “This cringing bit of filth would have seen you die 
too, without turning a hair. You heard him. His own stinking skin 
meant more to him than your whole family.” 
“I know,” Harry panted. “We’ll take him up to the castle. We’ll 
hand him over to the dementors. . . . He ca n go to Azkaban . . . 
but don’t kill him.” 
“Harry!” gasped Pettigrew, and he flung his arms around Harry’s 
knees. “You — thank you — it’s more than I deserve — thank 
you —” 
“Get off me,” Harry spat, throwing Pettigrew’s hands off him in 
 
CHAPTER NINETEEN 
 376  disgust. “I’m not doing this for you. I’m doing it because — I don’t 
reckon my dad would’ve wanted th em to become killers — just for 
you.” 
No one moved or made a sound except Pettigrew, whose breath 
w a s c o m i n g i n w h e e z e s a s h e c l u t c h e d h i s c h e s t . B l a c k a n d L u p i n 
were looking at each other. Then, with one movement, they low-ered their wands. 
“You’re the only person who has th e right to decide, Harry,” said 
Black. “But think . . . th ink what he did. . . .” 
“He can go to Azkaban,” Harry repeated. “If an yone deserves 
that place, he does. . . .” 
Pettigrew was still wh eezing behind him. 
“Very well,” said Lupin. “Stand aside, Harry.” 
Harry hesitated. 
“I’m going to tie him up,” said Lupin. “That’s all, I swear.” 
Harry stepped out of the way. Thin cords shot from Lupin’s 
wand this time, and next moment , Pettigrew was wriggling on the 
floor, bound and gagged. 
“But if you transform, Peter,” growled Black, his own wand 
pointing at Pettigrew too, “we will kill you. You agree, Harry?” 
Harry looked down at the pitiful figure on the floor and nodded 
so that Pettigrew could see him. 
“Right,” said Lupin, suddenly businesslike. “Ron, I can’t mend 
bones nearly as well as Madam Pomfrey, so I think it’ s best if 
we just strap your leg up until we can get you to the hospital 
wing.” 
He hurried over to Ron, bent down, tapped Ron’s leg with 
his wand, and muttered, “ Ferula. ” Bandages spun up Ron’s leg, 
 
THE SERVANT OF LORD VOLDEMORT 
 377  strapping it tightly to a splint. Lupin helped him to his feet; Ron 
put his weight gingerly on the leg and didn’t wince. 
“That’s better,” he said. “Thanks.” 
“What about Professor Snape?” said Hermione in a small voice, 
looking down at Sn ape’s prone figure. 
“There’s nothing seriously wrong with him,” said Lupin, bend-
ing over Snape and chec king his pulse. “You were just a little — 
overenthusiastic. Still out cold. Er — perhaps it will be best if we 
don’t revive him until we’re safely back in the castle. We can take 
him like this. . . .” 
He muttered, “ Mobilicorpus. ” As though invisible strings were 
tied to Snape’s wrists, neck, and kn ees, he was pulled into a stand-
ing position, head still lolling un pleasantly, like a grotesque pup-
pet. He hung a few inches ab ove the ground, his limp feet 
dangling. Lupin picked up the In visibility Cloak and tucked it 
safely into his pocket. 
“And two of us should be chained to this,” said Black, nudging 
Pettigrew with his toe. “Just to make sure.” 
“I’ll do it,” said Lupin. 
“And me,” said Ron savagely, limping forward. 
B l a c k c o n j u r e d h e a v y m a n a c l e s f r o m t h i n a i r ; s o o n P e t t i g r e w 
was upright again, left arm chaine d to Lupin’s right, right arm to 
Ron’s left. Ron’s face was set. He seemed to have taken Scabbers’s 
true identity as a personal insult. Crookshanks leapt lightly off the 
bed and led the way out of the room, his bottlebrush tail held jaun-
tily high.

 378  THE DEMENTOR ’S KISS 
 
 
 
arry had never been part of a stranger group. Crook-shanks led the way down the stairs; Lupin, Pettigrew, 
and Ron went next, looking like entr ants in a six-legged race. Next 
came Professor Snape, drifting cree pily along, his toes hitting each 
stair as they descende d, held up by his own wand, which was being 
pointed at him by Sirius. Harry an d Hermione brought up the rear. 
Getting back into the tunnel was difficult. Lupin, Pettigrew, and 
Ron had to turn sideways to mana ge it; Lupin still had Pettigrew 
covered with his wand. Harry could see them edging awkwardly along the tunnel in single file. Cr ookshanks was sti ll in the lead. 
Harry went right after Black, wh o was still making Snape drift 
along ahead of them; he kept bumping his lolling head on the low ceiling. Harry had the impression Black was making no effort to 
prevent this. 
“You know what this means?” Black said abruptly to Harry as they 
made their slow progress along the tunnel. “Turning Pettigrew in?” H 
THE DEMENTOR’S KISS 
 379  “You’re free,” said Harry. 
“Yes . . . ,” said Black. “But I’ m also — I don ’ t know if anyone 
ever told you — I’m your godfather.” 
“Yeah, I knew that,” said Harry. “Well . . . your parents appointed me your guardian,” said Black 
stiffly. “If anything happened to them . . .” 
Harry waited. Did Black mean what he thought he meant? 
“I’ll understand, of course, if you want to stay with your aunt and 
uncle,” said Black. “B ut . . . well . . . thin k about it. Once my 
name’s cleared . . . if you wanted a . . . a different home . . .” 
Some sort of explosion took plac e in the pit of Harry’s stomach. 
“What — live with you?” he said, accidentally cracking his head 
on a bit of rock protruding from the ceiling. “Leave the Dursleys?” 
“Of course, I thought you wouldn’t want to,” said Black quickly. 
“I understand, I just thought I’d —” 
“Are you insane?” said Ha rry, his voice easily as croaky as Black’s. 
“Of course I want to leave the Dursleys! Have you got a house? 
When can I move in?” 
Black turned right around to look at him; Snape’s head was 
scraping the ceiling but Black didn’t seem to care. 
“You want to?” he sa id. “You mean it?” 
“Yeah, I mean it!” said Harry. Black’s gaunt face broke into th e first true smile Harry had seen 
upon it. The difference it made was startling, as though a person 
ten years younger were shining through the starved mask; for a mo-
ment, he was recognizable as th e man who had laug hed at Harry’s 
parents’ wedding. 
They did not speak again until they had reached the end of the 
tunnel. Crookshanks darted up first; he had evidently pressed his 
CHAPTER TWENTY 
 380  paw to the knot on the trunk, be cause Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron 
clambered upward without any sound of savaging branches. 
Black saw Snape up through th e hole, then stood back for Harry 
and Hermione to pass. At last, all of them were out. 
The grounds were very dark now; the only light came from the 
distant windows of the castle. Without a word, they set off. Petti-
grew was still wheezing and occasionally whimpering. Harry’s 
mind was buzzing. He was going to leave the Dursleys. He was go-
ing to live with Sirius Black, his parents’ best friend. . . . He felt 
dazed. . . . What would happen wh en he told the Dursleys he was 
going to live with the convict th ey’d seen on television. . . ! 
“One wrong move, Peter,” said Lupin threateningly ahead. His 
wand was still pointed sideways at Pettigrew’s chest. 
Silently they tramped through the grounds, the castle lights 
growing slowly larger. Snape was still drifting weirdly ahead of 
Black, his chin bumping on his chest. And then — 
A cloud shifted. There were suddenly dim shadows on the 
ground. Their party was bathed in moonlight. 
Snape collided with Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron, who had 
stopped abruptly. Black froze. He flung out one arm to make 
Harry and Hermione stop. 
Harry could see Lupin’s silhouette . He had gone rigid. Then his 
limbs began to shake. 
“Oh, my —” Hermione gasped. “He didn’t take his potion 
tonight! He’s not safe!” 
“Run,” Black whispered. “Run. Now.” 
But Harry couldn’t run. Ron was chained to Pettigrew and 
Lupin. He leapt forw ard but Black caught him around the chest 
and threw him back. 
THE DEMENTOR’S KISS 
 381  “Leave it to me — RUN!” 
There was a terrible snarling nois e. Lupin’s head was lengthening. 
So was his body. His shoulders were hunching. Hair was sprouting 
visibly on his face and hands, whic h were curling into clawed paws. 
Crookshanks’s hair wa s on end again; he was backing away — 
As the werewolf reared, snapping its long jaws, Sirius disap-
peared from Harry’s side. He had transformed. The enormous, 
bearlike dog bounded forward. As the werewolf wrenched itself 
free of the manacle binding it, the dog seized it about the neck and 
pulled it backward, away from Ron and Pe ttigrew. They were 
locked, jaw to jaw, claws ripping at each other — 
Harry stood, transfixed by the si ght, too intent upon the battle 
to notice anything else. It was Hermione’s scream that alerted 
him — 
Pettigrew had dived for Lupin’s dropped wand. Ron, unsteady 
on his bandaged leg, fell. There was a bang, a burst of light — and 
Ron lay motionless on the ground . Another bang — Crookshanks 
flew into the air and back to the earth in a heap. 
“Expelliarmus !” Harry yelled, pointing his own wand at Petti-
grew; Lupin’s wand flew high into the air and out of sight. “Stay 
where you are!” Harry shou ted, running forward. 
Too late. Pettigrew had transformed. Harry saw his bald tail 
whip through the manacle on Ron’ s outstretched arm and heard a 
scurrying through the grass. 
There was a howl and a rumbling growl; Harry turned to see the 
werewolf taking flig ht; it was galloping into the forest — 
“Sirius, he’s gone , Pettigrew transformed!” Harry yelled. 
Black was bleeding; there were gashes across his muzzle and 
back, but at Harry’s words he sc rambled up again, and in an 
CHAPTER TWENTY 
 382  instant, the sound of hi s paws faded to silence as he pounded away 
across the grounds. 
Harry and Hermione dashed over to Ron. 
“What did he do to him?” Hermione whispered. Ron’s eyes were 
only half-closed, his mouth hung open; he was definitely alive, they could hear him breathing, but he didn’t seem to recognize them. 
“I don’t know. . . .” 
Harry looked desperately around. Black and Lupin both 
gone . . . they had no one but Snape for company, still hanging, unconscious, in midair. 
“We’d better get them up to the castle and tell someone,” said 
Harry, pushing his hair out of his eyes, trying to think straight. Come —” 
But then, from beyond the range of their vision, they heard a 
yelping, a whining: a dog in pain. . . . 
“Sirius,” Harry muttered, staring into the darkness. 
He had a moment’s indecision, bu t there was nothing they could 
do for Ron at the moment, and by the sound of it , Black was in 
trouble — 
Harry set off at a run, Hermione right behind him. The yelping 
seemed to be coming from the gr ound near the edge of the lake. 
They pelted toward it, and Harry, running flat out, felt the cold 
without realizing what it must mean — 
The yelping stopped abruptly. As they reached the lakeshore, 
they saw why — Sirius had turn e d b a c k i n t o a m a n . H e w a s 
crouched on all fours, his hands over his head. 
“Nooo, ” he moaned. “ Noooo . . . please. . . .” 
And then Harry saw them. Dementor s, at least a hundred of 
 
THE DEMENTOR’S KISS 
 383  them, gliding in a black mass ar ound the lake to ward them. He 
spun around, the familiar, icy co ld penetrating his insides, fog 
starting to obscure his vision; more were appearing out of the dark-
ness on every side; they we re encircling them. . . . 
“Hermione, think of something ha ppy!” Harry yelled, raising his 
wand, blinking furiously to try and clear his vision, shaking his 
head to rid it of the faint screa ming that had star ted inside it — 
I’m going to live with my godf ather. I’m leaving the Dursleys. 
He forced himself to think of Bl ack, and only Black, and began 
to chant: “ Expecto patronum ! Expecto patronum !” 
Black gave a shudder, rolled over, and lay motionless on the 
ground, pale as death. 
He’ll be all right. I’m goin g to go and live with him. 
“Expecto patronum ! Hermione, help me! Expecto patronum !” 
“Expecto —” Hermione whispered, “ expecto — expecto —” 
But she couldn’t do it. The dement ors were closing in, barely ten 
feet from them. They formed a solid wall around Harry and Hermione, and were getting closer. . . . 
“EXPECTO PATRONUM !” Harry yelled, t rying to blot the 
screaming from his ears. “ EXPECTO PATRONUM !” 
A thin wisp of silver escaped hi s wand and hovered like mist be-
fore him. At the same moment, Harry felt Hermione collapse next 
to him. He was alone . . . completely alone. . . . 
“Expecto — expecto patronum —” 
Harry felt his knees hit the cold gr ass. Fog was clouding his eyes. 
With a huge effort, he fought to remember — Sirius was inno-
cent — innocent — We’ll be okay — I’m going to live with him — 
“Expecto patronum !” he gasped. 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY 
 384  By the feeble light of his formle ss Patronus, he saw a dementor 
halt, very close to him. It couldn’t walk through the cloud of silver 
mist Harry had conjured. A dead, sl imy hand slid out from under 
the cloak. It made a gesture as th ough to sweep the Patronus aside. 
“No — no —” Harry gasped. “He’s innocent . . . expecto — 
expecto patronum —” 
He could feel them watching him, hear their rattling breath like 
an evil wind around him. The nea rest dementor seemed to be con-
sidering him. Then it raised both its rotting hands — and lowered 
its hood. 
Where there should have been ey es, there was only thin, gray 
scabbed skin, stretched blankly ov er empty sockets. But there was 
a mouth . . . a gaping, shapeless hole, sucking the air with the 
sound of a death rattle. 
A paralyzing terror filled Harry so that he couldn’t move or 
speak. His Patronus flickered and died. 
White fog was blinding him. He had to fight . . . expecto pa-
tronum . . . he couldn’t see . . . and in the distance, he heard the fa-
miliar screaming . . . expecto patronum . . . he groped in the mist 
for Sirius, and found his arm . . . they weren’t going to take 
him. . . . 
But a pair of strong, clammy hands suddenly attached them-
selves around Harry’s neck. They were forcing his face upward. . . . 
He could feel its breath. . . . It was going to get rid of him first. . . . 
He could feel its putrid breath. . . . His mother was screaming in 
his ears. . . . She was going to be the last thing he ever heard — 
And then, through the fog that was drowning him , he thought 
he saw a silvery light growing bright er and brighter. . . . He felt 
 
THE DEMENTOR’S KISS 
 385  himself fall forward onto the gra ss. . . . Facedown, too weak to 
move, sick and shaking, Harry opened his eyes. The dementor 
must have released him. The blin ding light was illuminating the 
grass around him. . . . The screaming had stopped, the cold was 
ebbing away. . . . 
Something was driving the dementors back. . . . It was circling 
around him and Black and Hermione. . . . They were leaving. . . . 
The air was warm again. . . . 
With every ounce of strength he could muster, Harry raised his 
head a few inches and saw an animal amid the light, galloping away 
across the lake. . . . Eyes blurred wi th sweat, Harry tried to make out 
what it was. . . . It was as bright as a unicorn. . . . Fighting to 
stay conscious, Harry watched it cant er to a halt as it reached the 
opposite shore. For a moment, Harry saw, by its brightness, some-
body welcoming it back . . . raising his hand to pat it . . . someone 
who looked strangely familiar . . . but it couldn’t be . . . 
Harry didn’t understand. He couldn ’t think anymore. He felt the 
last of his strength leave him, an d his head hit the ground as he 
fainted.

“Thank you, Minister.” “Order of Merlin, Second Class, I’d say. First Class, if I can

“Thank you very much indeed, Minister.” 
“Nasty cut you’ve got there. . . . Black’s work, I suppose?” 
“As a matter of fact, it was Pott er, Weasley, and Granger, Minis-
ter. . . .” 
“No!” 
“Black had bewitched them, I sa w it immediately. A Confundus 
Charm, to judge by their behavior. They seemed to think there was a possibility he was innocent. They weren’t responsible for their ac-
tions. On the other hand, their interference might have permitted 
 S 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 387  Black to escape. . . . They obviou sly thought they were going to 
catch Black single-handed. They’ve got away with a great deal be-
fore now. . . . I’m afraid it’s given them a rather high opinion of 
themselves . . . and of course Potter has always been allowed an ex-
traordinary amount of license by the headmaster —” 
“Ah, well, Snape . . . Harry Potter, you know . . . we’ve all got a 
bit of a blind spot wh ere he’s concerned.” 
“And yet — is it good for him to be given so much special treat-
ment? Personally, I try and treat him like any other student. And 
any other student would be susp ended — at the very least — for 
leading his friends into such dang er. Consider, Minister — against 
all school rules — after all the precautions put in place for his pro-tection — out-of-bounds, at nigh t, consorting with a werewolf 
and a murderer — and I have reason to believe he has been visiting Hogsmeade illegally too —” 
“Well, well . . . we shall see, Snape, we shall see. . . . The boy has 
undoubtedly been foolish. . . .” 
Harry lay listening with his eyes tight shut. He felt very groggy. 
The words he was hearing seemed to be traveling very slowly from 
his ears to his brain, so that it was difficult to understand. . . . His 
limbs felt like lead; his eyelids too heavy to lift. . . . He wanted to 
lie here, on this comfortable bed, forever. . . . 
“What amazes me most is the be havior of the dementors . . . 
you’ve really no idea what made them retreat, Snape?” 
“ N o , M i n i s t e r . . . b y t h e t i m e I h a d c o m e ’ r o u n d t h e y w e r e

“Extraordinary. And yet Black, and Harry, and the girl —” 
“All unconscious by the time I reached them. I bound and 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 388  gagged Black, naturally, conjured stretchers, and brought them all 
straight back to the castle.” 
There was a pause. Harry’s brain s eemed to be moving a little 
faster, and as it did, a gnawing sensation grew in the pit of his stom-
ach. . . . 
He opened his eyes. 
Everything was slightly blurred. Somebody had removed his 
glasses. He was lying in the dark hospital wing. At the very end of 
the ward, he could make out Ma dam Pomfrey with her back to 
him, bending over a bed. Harry squi nted. Ron’s red hair was visible 
beneath Madam Pomfrey’s arm. 
Harry moved his head over on the pillow. In the bed to his right 
lay Hermione. Moonlight was falling across her bed. Her eyes were open too. She looked petrified, and when she saw that Harry was 
awake, pressed a finger to her li ps, then pointed to the hospital 
wing door. It was ajar, and the voic es of Cornelius Fudge and Snape 
were coming through it fr om the corridor outside. 
Madam Pomfrey now came walking briskly up the dark ward to 
Harry’ s bed. He turned to look at her. She was carrying the largest 
block of chocolate he had ever seen in his life. It looked like a small 
boulder. 
“Ah, you’re awake!” she said briskly. She placed the chocolate on 
Harry’s bedside table and began breaking it apart with a small ham-mer. 
“How’s Ron?” said Harry and Hermione together. 
“He’ll live,” said Madam Pomfrey grimly. “As for you two . . . 
you’ll be staying here until I’m satisfied you’re — Potter, what do 
you think you’re doing?” 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 389  Harry was sitting up, putting his glasses back on, and picking up 
his wand. 
“I need to see the headmaster,” he said. 
“Potter,” said Madam Pomfrey soothingly, “it’s all right. They’ve 
got Black. He’s locked away upstairs. The dementors will be per-forming the kiss any moment now —” 
“WHAT?” 
Harry jumped up out of bed; Hermione had done the same. But 
his shout had been heard in the corridor outside; next second, Cor-nelius Fudge and Snape had entered the ward. 
“Harry, Harry, what’s this?” said Fudge, looking agitated. “You 
should be in bed — has he had any chocolate?” he asked Madam 
Pomfrey anxiously. 
“Minister, listen!” Harry said. “Sirius Black’s innocent! Peter Pet-
tigrew faked his own death! We saw him tonight! You can’t let the 
dementors do that thing to Sirius, he’s —” 
But Fudge was shaking his head wi th a small smile on his face. 
“Harry, Harry, you’re very co nfused, you’ve been through a 
dreadful ordeal, lie back down, now, we’ve got everything under 
control. . . .” 
“YOU HAVEN’T!” Harry yelled. “YOU’VE GOT THE 
WRONG MAN!” 
“Minister, listen, please,” Hermione said; she had hurried to 
Harry’s side and was ga zing imploringly into Fudge’s face. “I saw 
him too. It was Ron’s rat, he’s an Animagus, Pettigrew, I mean, 
and —” 
“You see, Minister?” said Snape. “Confunded, both of them. . . . 
Black’s done a very good job on them. . . .” 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 390  “WE’RE NOT CONFUNDED!” Harry roared. 
“Minister! Professor!” said Madam Pomfrey angrily. “I must in-
sist that you leave. Potter is my patient, and he should not be dis-
tressed!” 
“I’m not distressed, I’m trying to tell them what happened!” 
Harry said furiously. “If they’d just listen —” 
But Madam Pomfrey suddenly stuf fed a large ch unk of choco-
late into Harry’s mouth; he chok ed, and she seized the opportunity 
to force him back onto the bed. 
“Now, please, Minister, these children need care. Please leave —” 
The door opened again. It wa s Dumbledore. Harry swallowed 
his mouthful of chocolate with great difficulty and got up again. 
“Professor Dumbledore, Sirius Black —” 
“For heaven’s sake!” said Madam Pomfrey hysterically. “Is this a 
hospital wing or not? Headmaster, I must insist —” 
“My apologies, Poppy, but I need a word with Mr. Potter and 
Miss Granger,” said Dumb ledore calmly. “I have just been talking 
to Sirius Black —” 
“I suppose he’s told you the same fairy ta le he’s planted in 
Potter’s mind?” spat Snape. “Somet hing about a rat, and Pettigrew 
being alive —” 
“That, indeed, is Black’s story,” said Dumbledore, surveying 
Snape closely through his half-moon spectacles. 
“And does my evidence count for nothing?” snarled Snape. 
“Peter Pettigrew was not in the Sh rieking Shack, nor did I see any 
sign of him on the grounds.” 
“That was because you were knocked out, Professor!” said 
Hermione earnestly. “You didn’t arrive in time to hear —” 
“Miss Granger, HOLD YOUR TONGUE!” 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 391  “Now, Snape,” said Fudge, startled, “the young lady is disturbed 
in her mind, we must make allowances —” 
“I would like to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” said Dum-
bledore abruptly. “Cornelius, Severus, Poppy — please leave us.” 
“Headmaster!” sputte red Madam Pomfrey “They need treat-
ment, they need rest —” 
“This cannot wait,” said Dumb ledore. “I must insist.” 
Madam Pomfrey pursed her lips and strode away into her office 
at the end of the wa rd, slamming the door behind her. Fudge con-
sulted the large gold pocket watc h dangling from his waistcoat. 
“The dementors should have arri ved by now,” he said. “I’ll go 
and meet them. Dumbledore , I’ll see you upstairs.” 
He crossed to the door and held it open for Snape, but Snape 
hadn’t moved. 
“You surely don’t believe a word of Black’s story?” Snape 
whispered, his eyes fixe d on Dumbledore’s face. 
“I wish to speak to Harry and Hermione alone,” Dumbledore 
repeated. 
Snape took a step toward Dumbledore. 
“Sirius Black showed he was capable of murder at the age of six-
teen,” he breathed. “You haven’t forgotten that, Headmaster? You 
haven’t forgotten that he once tried to kill me?” 
“My memory is as good as it ev er was, Severus,” said Dumble-
dore quietly. 
Snape turned on his heel and marched through the door Fudge 
was still holding. It closed behi nd them, and Dumbledore turned 
to Harry and Hermione. They both burst into speech at the same 
time. 
“Professor, Black’s telling the truth — we saw Pettigrew —” 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 392  “— he escaped when Professor Lu pin turned into a werewolf —” 
“— he’s a rat —” 
“— Pettigrew’s front paw, I me an, finger, he cut it off —” 
“— Pettigrew attacked Ron, it wasn’t Sirius —” 
But Dumbledore held up his hand to stem the flood of explana-
tions. 
“It is your turn to listen, and I beg you will not interrupt me, be-
cause there is very little time,” he said quietly. “There is not a shred 
of proof to support Black’s stor y, except your word — and the 
word of two thirteen-year-old wiza rds will not convince anybody. 
A street full of eyewitnesses swore they saw Sirius murder Pettigrew. I myself gave evidence to the Mi nistry that Sirius had been the 
Potters’ Secret-Keeper.” 
“Professor Lupin can tell you —” Harry said, unable to stop 
himself. 
“Professor Lupin is currently deep in the forest, unable to tell 
anyone anything. By the time he is human again, it will be too late, 
Sirius will be worse than dead. I might add that werewolves are so 
mistrusted by most of our kind that his support will count for very 
little — and the fact that he and Sirius are old friends —” 
“But —” 
“Listen to me, Harry. It is too late, you understand me? You must 
see that Professor Snape’s version of events is far more convincing 
than yours.” 
“He hates Sirius,” Hermione said desperately. “All because of 
some stupid trick Siri us played on him —” 
“Sirius has not acted like an i nnocent man. The attack on the 
Fat Lady — entering Gryffindor Tower with a knife — without

 393  Pettigrew, alive or dead, we have no chance of overturning Sirius’s 
sentence.” 
“But you believe us. ” 
“Yes, I do,” said Dumbledore quietly. “But I have no power to 
make other men see the truth, or to overrule the Minister of 
Magic. . . . 
Harry stared up into the grave face and felt as though the ground 
beneath him were falling sharply away. He had grown used to the 
idea that Dumbledore could solve anything. He had expected 
Dumbledore to pull some amazing solution out of the air. But 
no . . . their last hope was gone. 
“What we need,” said Dumbledo re slowly, and his light blue 
eyes moved from Harry to Hermione, “is more time. ” 
“ B u t — ” H e r m i o n e b e g a n . A n d then her eyes became very 
round. “OH!” 
“Now, pay attention,” said Dumb ledore, speaking very low, and 
very clearly. “Sirius is locked in Professor Flitwick’s office on the 
seventh floor. Thirteenth window from the right of the West 
Tower. If all goes well, you will be able to save more than one in-
nocent life tonight. But re member this, both of you: you must not 
be seen. Miss Granger, you know the law — you know what is at 
stake. . . . You — must — not — be — seen.” 
Harry didn’t have a clue what was going on. Dumbledore had 
turned on his heel and looked back as he reached the door. 
“I am going to lock you in. It is —” he consulted his watch, “five 
minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good 
luck.” 
“Good luck?” Harry repeated as the door closed behind 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 394  Dumbledore. “Three turns? What’s he talking about? What are we 
supposed to do?” 
But Hermione was fumbling with the neck of her robes, pulling 
from beneath them a very lo ng, very fine gold chain. 
“Harry, come here,” she said urgently. “ Quick !” 
Harry moved toward he r, completely bewildered. She was holding 
the chain out. He saw a tiny, sparkling hourglass hanging from it. 
“Here —” 
She had thrown the chain around his neck too. 
“Ready?” she said breathlessly. “What are we doing?” Harry said, completely lost. Hermione turned the hour glass over three times. 
The dark ward dissolved. Harry had the sensation that he was 
flying very fast, backward. A blur of colors an d shapes rushed past 
him, his ears were pounding, he tried to yell but couldn’t hear his own voice — 
And then he felt solid ground b eneath his feet, and everything 
came into focus again — 
He was standing next to Hermione in the deserted entrance hall 
and a stream of golden sunlight was falling across the paved floor 
from the open front doors. He looked wildly around at Hermione, the chain of the hourglass cutting into his neck. 
“Hermione, what — ?” “In here!” Hermione seized Harry’s arm and dragged him across 
the hall to the door of a broom closet; she opened it, pushed him 
inside among the buck ets and mops, then slammed the door be-
hind them. 
“What — how — Hermione , what happened?” 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 395  “We’ve gone back in time,” He rmione whispered, lifting the 
chain off Harry’s neck in the dark ness. “Three hours back . . .” 
Harry found his own leg and gave it a very hard pinch. It hurt a 
lot, which seemed to rule out the possibility that he was having a 
very bizarre dream. 
“But —” 
“Shh! Listen! Someone’s coming! I think — I think it might be 
us!” 
Hermione had her ear presse d against the cupboard door. 
“Footsteps across the hall . . . yes, I think it’s us going down to 
Hagrid’s!” 
“Are you telling me,” Harry whispe red, “that we’re here in this 
cupboard and we’re out there too?” 
“Yes,” said Hermione, her ear still glued to the cupboard door. 
“I’ m sur e i t’ s us. It d o esn ’ t so und l ike mo re t h an t hree pe o ple . . . and we’re walking slowly because we’re under the Invisibility Cloak —” 
She broke off, still listening intently. 
“We’ve gone down the front steps. . . .” 
Hermione sat down on an upturned bucket, looking desperately 
anxious, but Harr y wanted a few questions answered. 
“Where did you get that hourglass thing?” 
“It’s called a Time-Turner,” Herm ione whispered, “and I got it 
from Professor McGonagall on our fi rst day back. I’ve been using it 
all year to get to all my lessons . Professor McGonagall made me 
swear I wouldn’t tell anyone. She had to write all sorts of letters to 
the Ministry of Magic so I could have one. She had to tell them 
that I was a model stud ent, and that I’d never, ever use it for 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 396  anything except my studies. . . . I’ve been turning it back so I could 
do hours over again, that’s how I’ ve been doing several lessons at 
once, see? But . . . 
“Harry, I don’t understand what Dumbledore wants us to do. Why 
did he tell us to go back three hours? How’s that going to help 
Sirius?” 
Harry stared at her shadowy face. 
“There must be something that happened around now he wants 
us to change,” he said slowly. “What happened? We were walking 
down to Hagrid’s three hours ago. . . .” 
“This is three hours ago, and we are walking down to Hagrid’s,” 
said Hermione. “We just hear d ourselves leaving. . . .” 
Harry frowned; he felt as though he were screwing up his whole 
brain in concentration. 
“Dumbledore just said — just said we could save more than one 
innocent life. . . .” And then it hit him. “Hermione, we’re going to 
save Buckbeak!” 
“But — how will that help Sirius?” 
“Dumbledore said — he just told us where the window is — 
the window of Flitwick’s office! Where they’ve got Sirius locked 
up! We’ve got to fly Buckbeak up to the window and rescue 
Sirius! Sirius can escape on Buckbeak — they can escape to-
gether!” 
From what Harry could see of He rmione’s face, she looked terri-
fied. 
“If we manage that without being seen, it’ll be a miracle!” 
“Well, we’ve got to t ry, haven’t we?” said Harry. He stood up and 
pressed his ear against the door. 
“Doesn’t sound like anyone’s there. . . . Come on, let’s go. . . .” 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 397  Harry pushed open the closet do or. The entrance hall was de-
serted. As quietly and quickly as th ey could, they darted out of the 
closet and down the stone steps. The shadows were already length-
ening, the tops of the trees in the Forbidden Fore st gilded once 
more with gold. 
“If anyone’s looking out of the window —” Hermione 
squeaked, looking up at the castle behind them. 
“We’ll run for it,” said Harry determinedly. “Straight into the 
forest, all right? We’ll have to hide behind a tree or something and 
keep a lookout —” 
“Okay, but we’ll go around by the greenhouses!” said Hermione 
breathlessly. “We need to keep out of sight of Hagrid’s front door, 
or we’ll see us! We must be nearly at Hagrid’s by now!” 
Still working out what she meant, Harry set off at a sprint, 
Hermione behind him. They tore across the vegetable gardens to 
the greenhouses, paused for a mo ment behind them, then set off 
again, fast as they could, skir ting around the Whomping Willow, 
tearing toward the shelte r of the forest. . . . 
Safe in the shadows of the trees, Harry turned around; seconds 
later, Hermione arrived beside him, panting. 
“Right,” she gasped. “We need to sneak over to Hagrid’s. . . . 
Keep out of sight, Harry. . . .” 
They made their way silently through the trees, keeping to 
the very edge of the forest. Then, as they glimpsed the front of 
Hagrid’s house, they heard a knock upon his door. They moved quickly behind a wide oak trun k and peered out from either 
side. Hagrid had appeared in his doorway, shaking and white, 
looking around to see who had knocked. And Harry heard his own 
voice. 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 398  “It’s us. We’re wearing the Invisibility Cloak. Let us in and we 
can take it off.” 
“Yeh shouldn’ve come!” Hagrid whispered. He stood back, then 
shut the door quickly. 
“This is the weirdest thing we’ve ever done,” Harry said fer-
vently. 
“Let’s move along a bit,” Hermio ne whispered. “We need to get 
nearer to Buckbeak!” 
They crept through the trees until they saw the nervous hip-
pogriff, tethered to the fence around Hagrid’s pumpkin patch. 
“Now?” Harry whispered. 
“No!” said Hermione. “If we steal him now, those Committee 
people will think Hagrid set him free! We’ve got to wait until they’ve seen he’s tied outside!” 
“That’s going to give us about si xty seconds,” said Harry. This 
was starting to seem impossible. 
At that moment, there was a crash of breaking china from inside 
Hagrid’s cabin. 
“That’s Hagrid breaking the mi lk jug,” Hermione whispered. 
“I’m going to find Scabbers in a moment —” 
Sure enough, a few minutes later, they heard Hermione’s shriek 
of surprise. 
“Hermione,” said Harry suddenly, “what if we — we just run in 
there and grab Pettigrew —” 
“No!” said Hermione in a terrified whisper. “Don’t you under-
stand? We’re breaking one of th e most important wizarding laws! 
Nobody’s supposed to change time, nobody! You heard Dumble-dore, if we’re seen —” 
“We’d only be seen by ourselves and Hagrid!” 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 399  “Harry, what do you think you’d do if you saw yourself bursting 
into Hagrid’s house?” said Hermione. 
“I’d — I’d think I’d gone mad,” said Harry, “or I’d think there 
was some Dark Magic going on —” 
“Exactly ! You wouldn’t understand, you might even attack your-
self! Don’t you see? Professor Mc Gonagall told me what awful 
things have happened when wizards have meddled with time. . . . 
Loads of them ended up killing their past or future selves by mis-
take!” 
“Okay!” said Harry. “It was just an idea, I just thought —” 
But Hermione nudged him and pointed toward the castle. 
Harry moved his head a few inches to get a clear view of the distant 
front doors. Dumbledore, Fudge, the old Committee member, and Macnair the executioner were coming down the steps. 
“We’re about to come out!” Hermione breathed. And sure enough, moments later, Hagrid’s back door opened, 
and Harry saw himself, Ron, and Herm ione walking out of it with 
Hagrid. It was, without a doubt, the strangest sensation of his life, 
standing behind the tree, and wa tching himself in the pumpkin 
patch. 
“It’s okay, Beaky, it’s okay . . . ,” Hagrid said to Buckbeak. Then 
he turned to Harry, Ron, and Hermione. “Go on. Get goin’.” 
“Hagrid, we can’t —” 
“We’ll tell them what really happened —” “They can’t kill him —” 
“Go! It’s bad enough without you lot in trouble an’ all!” 
Harry watched the Hermione in the pumpkin patch throw the 
Invisibility Cloak over him and Ron. 
“Go quick. Don’ listen. . . .” 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 400  There was a knock on Hagrid’s front door. The execution party 
had arrived. Hagrid turned around and headed back into his cabin, 
leaving the back door ajar. Harry watched the grass flatten in 
patches all around the cabin and heard three pairs of feet retreat-
ing. He, Ron, and Hermione had gone . . . but the Harry and 
Hermione hidden in the trees coul d now hear what was happening 
inside the cabin through the back door. 
“Where is the beast?” came the cold voice of Macnair. “Out — outside,” Hagrid croaked. 
Harry pulled his head out of sight as Macnair’s face appeared at 
Hagrid’s window, staring out at Bu ckbeak. Then they heard Fudge. 
“We — er — have to read you the official notice of execution, 
Hagrid. I’ll make it quick. And th en you and Macnair need to sign 
it. Macnair, you’re supposed to listen too, that’s procedure —” 
Macnair’s face vanished from the window. It was now or never. 
“Wait here,” Harry whispered to Hermione. “I’ll do it.” As Fudge’s voice started again, Harry darted out from behind his 
tree, vaulted the fence into the pumpkin patch, and approached 
Buckbeak. 
“It is the decision of the Committe e for the Disposal of Dangerous 
Creatures that the hi ppogriff Buckbeak, hereafter called the con-
demned, shall be executed on the sixth of June at sundown —” 
Careful not to blink, Harry stared up into Buckbeak’s fierce or-
ange eyes once more and bowed. Buckbeak sank to his scaly knees 
and then stood up again. Harry began to fumble with the knot of rope tying Buckbeak to the fence. 
“. . . sentenced to execution by beheading, to be carried out by the 
Committee ’s appointed executione r, Walden Macnair . . .” 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 401  
“Come on, Buckbeak,” Harry murmured, “come on, we’re go-
ing to help you. Quietl y . . . quietly . . .” 
“. . . as witnessed below. Hagrid, you sign here. . . .” 
Harry threw all his weight onto the rope, but Buckbeak had dug 
in his front feet. 
“Well, let’s get this over with,” said the reedy voice of the Com-
mittee member from inside Hagrid’s cabin. “Hagrid, perhaps it 
will be better if you stay inside —” 
“No, I — I wan’ ter be with him. . . . I don’ wan’ him ter be 
alone —” 
Footsteps echoed from within the cabin. 
“Buckbeak, move !” Harry hissed. 
Harry tugged harder on the rope around Buckbeak’s neck. The 
hippogriff began to walk, rustling its wings irritably. They were still 
ten feet away from the forest, in plain view of Hagrid’s back door. 
“One moment, please, Macnair,” came Dumbledore’s voice. 
“You need to sign too.” The foot steps stopped. Harry heaved on 
the rope. Buckbeak snapped his be ak and walked a little faster. 
Hermione’s white face was stic king out from behind a tree. 
“Harry, hurry!” she mouthed. Harry could still hear Dumbledore’s voice talking from within 
the cabin. He gave the rope anot her wrench. Buckbeak broke into 
a grudging trot. They had reached the trees. . . . 
“Quick! Quick!” Hermione moaned, darting out from behind 
her tree, seizing the rope too and adding her weight to make Buck-
beak move faster. Harry looked over his shoulder; they were now blocked from sight; they couldn’t see Hagrid’s garden at all. 
“Stop!” he whispered to Hermione. “They might hear us —” 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 402  Hagrid’s back door had opened with a bang. Harry, Hermione, 
and Buckbeak stood quite still; ev en the hippogriff seemed to be 
listening intently. 
Silence . . . then — 
“Where is it?” said the reedy voice of the Committee member. 
“Where is the beast?” 
“It was tied here!” said the execut ioner furiously. “I saw it! Just 
here!” 
“How extraordinary,” said Dumbledore. There was a note of 
amusement in his voice. 
“Beaky!” said Hagrid huskily. 
There was a swishing noise, and the thud of an axe. The execu-
tioner seemed to have swung it into the fence in anger. And then 
came the howling, and this time they could hear Hagrid’s words 
through his sobs. 
“Gone! Gone! Bless his little beak, he’s gone! Musta pulled him-
self free! Beaky, yeh clever boy!” 
Buckbeak started to strain against the rope, trying to get back to 
Hagrid. Harry and Hermione tighte ned their grip and dug their 
heels into the forest floor to stop him. 
“Someone untied him!” the ex ecutioner was snarling. “We 
should search the grou nds, the forest —” 
“Macnair, if Buckbeak has indeed been stolen, do you really 
think the thief will have led him away on foot?” said Dumbledore, 
still sounding amused. “S earch the skies, if yo u will. . . . Hagrid, I 
could do with a cup of tea. Or a large brandy.” 
“O’ — o’ course, Professor,” said Hagrid, who sounded weak 
with happiness. “Come in, come in. . . .” 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 403  Harry and Hermione listened closel y. They heard footsteps, the 
soft cursing of the executioner, the snap of the door, and then si-
lence once more. 
“Now what?” whispered Harry, looking around. 
“We’ll have to hide in here,” said Hermione, who looked very 
shaken. “We need to wait until th ey’ve gone back to the castle. 
Then we wait until it’s safe to fly Buckbeak up to Sirius’s window. 
He won’t be there for another couple of hours. . . . Oh, this is go-
ing to be difficult. . . .” 
She looked nervously over her shoulder into the depths of the 
forest. The sun was setting now. 
“We’re going to have to move,” said Harry, thinking hard. 
“We’ve got to be able to see th e Whomping Willow, or we won’t 
know what’s going on.” 
“Okay,” said Hermione, getting a firmer grip on Buckbeak’s 
rope. “But we’ve got to keep out of sight, Harry, remember. . . .” 
They moved around the edge of the forest, darkness falling 
thickly around them, until they were hidden behind a clump of 
trees through which they co uld make out the Willow. 
“There’s Ron!” sa id Harry suddenly. 
A dark figure was sprinting acro ss the lawn and its shout echoed 
through the still night air. 
“Get away from him — get away — Scabbers, come here —” 
And then they saw two more figures materialize out of nowhere. 
Harry watched himself and Hermio ne chasing after Ron. Then he 
saw Ron dive. 
“Gotcha ! Get off, you stinking cat —” 
“There’s Sirius!” said Harry. The great shape of the dog had 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 404  bounded out from the roots of the Willow. They saw him bowl 
Harry over, then seize Ron. . . . 
“Looks even worse from here, doesn’t it?” said Harry, watching 
the dog pulling Ron into the roots. “Ouch — look, I just got wal-
loped by the tree — and so did you — this is weird —” 
The Whomping Willow was creaki ng and lashing out with its 
lower branches; they could see themselves darting here and there, trying to reach the trunk. And then the tree froze. 
“That was Crookshanks pressing the knot,” said Hermione. 
“And there we go . . . ,” Harry muttered. “We’re in.” 
The moment they disappeared, th e tree began to move again. 
Seconds later, they heard footst eps quite close by. Dumbledore, 
Macnair, Fudge, and the old Committee me mber were making 
their way up to the castle. 
“Right after we’d gone down into the passage!” said Hermione. 
“If only Dumbledore had come with us . . .” 
“Macnair and Fudge would’ve come too,” said Harr y bitterly. “I 
bet you anything Fudge would’ve told Macnair to murder Sirius on 
the spot. . . .” 
They watched the four men climb the castle steps and disappear 
from view. For a few minutes the scene was deserted. Then — 
“Here comes Lupin!” said Harry as they saw another figure 
sprinting down the stone steps and haring toward the Willow. 
Harry looked up at the sky. Clou ds were obscurin g the moon com-
pletely. 
They watched Lupin seize a broken branch from the ground and 
prod the knot on the trunk. The tree stopped fighting, and Lupin, 
too, disappeared into the gap in its roots. 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 405  “If he’d only grabbed the cloak,” said Harry. “It’s just lying 
there. . . .” 
He turned to Hermione. 
“If I just dashed out now and grabbed it, Snape’d never be able 
to get it and —” 
“Harry, we mustn’t be seen !” 
“How can you stand this?” he asked Hermione fiercely. “Just 
standing here and watching it happen?” He hesitated. “I’m going to grab the cloak!” 
“Harry, no!” 
Hermione seized the back of Harry’s robes not a moment too 
soon. Just then, they heard a burs t of song. It was Hagrid, making 
his way up to the castle, singing at the top of his voice, and weav-
ing slightly as he wa lked. A large bottle was swinging from his 
hands. 
“See?” Hermione whispered. “ See what would have happened ? 
We’ve got to keep out of sight! No, Buckbeak !” 
The hippogriff was making frantic attempts to get to Hagrid 
again; Harry seized his rope too, straining to hold Buckbeak back. 
T h e y w a t c h e d H a g r i d m e a n d e r t i p s i l y u p t o t h e c a s t l e . H e w a s 
gone. Buckbeak stopped fighting to get away. His head drooped 
sadly. 
Barely two minutes later, the castle doors flew open yet again, 
and Snape came charging out of them, running toward the Willow. 
Harry’s fists clenched as they wa tched Snape skid to a halt next 
to the tree, looking around. He gr abbed the cloak and held it up. 
“Get your filthy hands off it,” Harry snarled under his breath. 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 406  “Shh!” 
Snape seized the branch Lupin ha d used to freeze the tree, prod-
ded the knot, and vanish ed from view as he put on the cloak. 
“So that’s it,” said Hermione quie tly. “We’re all down there . . . 
and now we’ve just got to wait until we come back up again. . . .” 
She took the end of Buckbeak’s rope and tied it securely around 
the nearest tree, then sat down on the dry ground, arms around her knees. 
“Harry, there’s something I don’t understand. . . . Why didn’t 
the dementors get Sirius? I reme mber them coming, and then I 
think I passed out . . . there were so ma ny of them. . . .” 
Harry sat down too. He explaine d what he’d seen; how, as the 
nearest dementor had lowered its mouth to Harry’s, a large silver 
something had come galloping acro ss the lake and forced the de-
mentors to retreat. 
Hermione’s mouth was slightly open by the time Harry had fin-
ished. 
“But what was it?” 
“There’s only one thing it coul d have been, to make the demen-
tors go,” said Harry. “A re al Patronus. A powerful one.” 
“But who conjured it?” 
Harry didn’t say anything. He was thinking back to the person 
he’d seen on the other bank of the lake. He knew who he thought it had been . . . but how could it have been? 
“Didn’t you see what they looked like?” said Hermione eagerly. 
“Was it one of the teachers?” 
“No,” said Harry. “H e wasn’t a teacher.” 
“But it must have been a really powerful wizard, to drive all 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 407  those dementors away. . . . If the Patronus was shining so brightly, 
didn’t it light him up? Couldn’t you see — ?” 
“Yeah, I saw him,” said Harry sl owly. “But . . . maybe I imag-
ined it. . . . I wasn’t thinking st raight. . . . I passed out right after-
ward. . . .” 
“Who did you think it was ?” 
“I think —” Harry swallowed, knowing how strange this was 
going to sound. “I think it was my dad.” 
Harry glanced up at Hermione and saw that her mouth was fully 
open now. She was gazing at him with a mixture of alarm and pity. 
“Harry, your da d’s — well — dead, ” she said quietly. 
“I know that,” said Harry quickly. “You think you saw his ghost?” 
“I don’t know . . . no . . . he looked solid. . . .” 
“But then —” “Maybe I was seeing t hings,” said Harry. “But . . . from what I 
could see . . . it looked like him. . . . I’ve got photos of him. . . .” 
Hermione was still looking at hi m as though worried about his 
sanity. 
“I know it sounds crazy,” said Harry flatly. He turned to look at 
Buckbeak, who was digging his beak into the ground, apparently searching for worms. But he wasn ’t really watching Buckbeak. 
He was thinking about his father and about his father’s three 
oldest friends . . . Moony, Worm tail, Padfoot, and Prongs. . . . 
Had all four of them been out on the grounds tonight? Wormtail 
had reappeared this evening when everyone had thought he was 
dead. . . . Was it so impossible his father had done the same? Had 
he been seeing things across the la ke? The figure had been too far 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 408  away to see distinctly . . . yet he had felt sure, for a moment, before 
he’d lost consciousness. . . . 
The leaves overhead rustled fa intly in the br eeze. The moon 
drifted in and out of sight behind the shifting clouds. Hermione 
sat with her face turned toward the Willow, waiting. 
And then, at last, afte r over an hour . . . 
“Here we come!” Hermione whispered. She and Harry got to their feet. Bu ckbeak raised his head. They 
saw Lupin, Pettigrew, and Ron cl ambering awkwardly out of the 
hole in the roots . . . followed by the unconscious Snape, drifting 
weirdly upward. Next came Harry, Hermione, and Black. They all 
began to walk toward the castle. 
Harry’s heart was starting to beat very fast. He gl anced up at the 
sky. Any moment now, that clou d was going to move aside and 
show the moon. . . . 
“Harry,” Hermione muttered as though she knew exactly what he 
was thinking, “we’ve got to stay put. We mustn’t be seen. There’s nothing we can do. . . .” 
“So we’re just going to let Pettigrew escape all over again. . . .” 
said Harry quietly. 
“How do you expect to find a rat in the dark?” snapped 
Hermione. “There’s nothing we can do! We came back to help Sirius; we’re not supposed to be doing anything else!” 
“All right !” 
The moon slid out from behind its cloud. They saw the tiny fig-
ures across the grounds stop . Then they sa w movement — 
“There goes Lupin,” Hermione whis pered. “He’s transforming —” 
“Hermione!” said Harry suddenly. “We’ve got to move!” 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 409  “We mustn’t, I keep telling you —” 
“Not to interfere! Lupin’s going to run into the forest, right at 
us!” 
Hermione gasped. “Quick!” she moaned, dashing to untie Buckbeak. “Quick! 
Where are we going to go? Where are we going to hide? The de-
mentors will be coming any moment —” 
“Back to Hagrid’s!” Harry said. “It’s empty now — come on!” 
They ran as fast as they could, Buckbeak cantering along 
behind them. They could hear the werewolf howling behind them. . . . 
The cabin was in sight; Harry sk idded to the door, wrenched it 
open, and Hermione and Buckbeak flashed past him; Harry threw 
himself in after them and bolt ed the door. Fang the boarhound 
barked loudly. 
“Shh, Fang, it’s us!” said Herm ione, hurrying over and scratch-
ing his ears to quieten him. “Tha t was really close!” she said to 
Harry. 
“Yeah . . .” 
Harry was looking out of the window . It was much harder to see 
what was going on from here. Buckbeak seemed very happy to find 
himself back inside Hagrid’s hous e. He lay down in front of the 
fire, folded his wings contentedl y, and seemed ready for a good 
nap. 
“I think I’d better go outside again, you know,” said Harry 
slowly. “I can’t see what’s going on — we won’t know when it’s 
time —” 
Hermione looked up. Her expression was suspicious. 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 410  “I’m not going to try and interfere,” said Harry quickly. “But if 
we don’t see what’s going on, how’ re we going to know when it’s 
time to rescue Sirius?” 
“Well . . . okay, then . . . I’ll wait here with Buckbeak . . . but 
Harry, be careful — there’s a werewolf out there — and the de-
mentors —” 
Harry stepped outside again and edged around the cabin. He 
could hear yelping in the distance. That meant the dementors were closing in on Sirius. . . . He and Hermione would be running to 
him any moment. . . . 
Harry stared out toward the lake , his heart doing a kind of 
drumroll in his chest. . . . Whoe ver had sent that Patronus would 
be appearing at any moment. . . . 
For a fraction of a second he st ood, irresolute, in front of Ha-
grid’s door. You must not be seen. But he didn’t want to be seen. He 
wanted to do the seeing. . . . He had to know. . . . 
And there were the dementors. They we re emerging out of 
the darkness from every direction, gliding around the edges of the 
lake. . . . They were moving away from where Harry stood, to 
the opposite bank. . . . He wouldn’t have to get near them. . . . 
Harry began to run. He had no thought in his head except his 
father. . . . If it was him . . . if it really was him . . . he had to know, 
had to find out. . . . 
The lake was coming nearer and nearer, but there was no sign of 
anybody. On the opposite bank, he could see tiny gl immers of sil-
ver — his own attempts at a Patronus — 
There was a bush at the very ed ge of the water. Harry threw 
himself behind it, peering desperat ely through the leaves. On the 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 411  opposite bank, the glimmers of silver were suddenly extinguished. 
A terrified excitement shot th rough him — any moment now — 
“Come on!” he muttered, staring about. “Where are you? Dad, 
come on —” 
But no one came. Harry raised his head to look at the circle of 
dementors across the lake. One of them was lowering its hood. It 
was time for the rescue r to appear — but no one was coming to 
help this time — 
And then it hit him — he unders tood. He hadn’t seen his fa-
ther — he had seen himself — 
Harry flung himself out from be hind the bush and pulled out 
his wand. 
“EXPECTO PATRONUM !” he yelled. 
And out of the end of his wand burst, not a shapeless cloud of 
mist, but a blinding, da zzling, silver animal. He screwed up his 
eyes, trying to see what it was. It looked like a hors e. It was gallop-
ing silently away from him, across the black surface of the lake. He 
saw it lower its head and charge at the swarming dementors. . . . 
Now it was galloping around and around the black shapes on the 
ground, and the dementors were falli ng back, scatteri ng, retreating 
into the darkness. . . . They were gone. 
The Patronus turned. It was cant ering back toward Harry across 
the still surface of the water. It wa sn’t a horse. It wasn’t a unicorn, 
either. It was a stag. It was shinin g brightly as the moon above . . . 
it was coming back to him. . . . 
It stopped on the bank . Its hooves made no mark on the soft 
ground as it stared at Harry with its large, silver eyes. Slowly, it 
bowed its antlered head. And Harry realized . . . 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 412  “Prongs,” he whispered. 
But as his trembling fingertips stretched toward the creature, it 
vanished. 
Harry stood there, hand still ou tstretched. Then , with a great 
leap of his heart, he heard hooves behind him — he whirled 
around and saw Hermione dashing toward him, dragging Buck-
beak behind her. 
“What did you do ?” she said fiercely. “You said you were only go-
ing to keep a lookout!” 
“I just saved all our lives . . . ,” said Harry. “Get behind here — 
behind this bush — I’ll explain.” 
Hermione listened to what had just happened with her mouth 
open yet again. 
“Did anyone see you?” 
“Yes, haven’t you been listening? I saw me but I thought I was 
my dad! It’s okay!” 
“Harry, I can’t believe it. . . . Yo u conjured up a Patronus that 
drove away all those dementors! That’s very, very advanced 
magic. . . .” 
“I knew I could do it this time,” said Harry, “because I’d already 
done it. . . . Does that make sense?” 
“I don’t know — Harry, look at Snape!” Together they peered around th e bush at the other bank. Snape 
had regained consciousness. He was conjuring stretchers and lift-
ing the limp forms of Harry, He rmione, and Black onto them. A 
fourth stretcher, no doubt bearing Ron, was already floating at his side. Then, wand held out in front of him, he moved them away toward the castle. 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 413  “Right, it’s nearly time,” said Hermione tensely, looking at her 
watch. “We’ve got about forty- five minutes until Dumbledore 
locks the door to the hospital wing. We’ve got to rescue Sirius and 
get back into the ward before anybody realizes we’re missing. . . .” 
They waited, watching the moving clouds reflected in the lake, 
while the bush next to them whis pered in the breeze. Buckbeak, 
bored, was ferreting for worms again. 
“D’ you reckon he’s up there yet?” said Harry, checking his 
watch. He looked up at the castle and began counting the windows 
to the right of the West Tower. 
“Look!” Hermione whispered. “W ho’s that? Someone’s coming 
back out of the castle!” 
Harry stared through the dark ness. The man was hurrying 
across the grounds, toward one of the entrances. Something shiny 
glinted in his belt. 
“Macnair!” said Harry. “The ex ecutioner! He’s gone to get the 
dementors! This is it, Hermione —” 
Hermione put her hands on Buckbe ak’s back and Harry gave her 
a leg up. Then he placed his foot on one of the lower branches of 
the bush and climbed up in front of her. He pulled Buckbeak’s rope 
back over his neck and tied it to the other side of his collar like 
reins. 
“Ready?” he whispere d to Hermione. “You’d better hold on to 
me —” 
He nudged Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Buckbeak soared straight into the dark air. Harry gripped his 
flanks with his knees, feeling the gr eat wings rising powerfully be-
neath them. Hermione was holding Harry very tight around the 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE 
 414  waist; he could hear her muttering, “Oh, no — I don’t like this — 
oh, I really don’t like this —” 
Harry urged Buckbeak forward. They were gliding quietly 
toward the upper floors of the castle. . . . Har ry pulled hard on the 
left-hand side of the rope, and Buckbeak turned. Harry was trying 
to count the windows flashing past — 
“Whoa!” he said, pulling backward as hard as he could. 
Buckbeak slowed down and they fo und themselves at a stop, un-
less you counted the fact that they kept rising up and down several 
feet as the hippogriff beat his wings to remain airborne. 
“He’s there!” Harry said, spotting Sirius as they rose up beside 
the window. He reached out, and as Buckbeak’s wings fell, was able 
to tap sharply on the glass. 
Black looked up. Harry saw his jaw drop. He leapt from his 
chair, hurried to the window and tr ied to open it, but it was locked. 
“Stand back!” Hermione called to him, and she took out her 
wand, still gripping the back of Harry’s robes with her left hand. 
“Alohomora !” 
The window sprang open. 
“How — how — ?” said Black weakly, staring at the hippogriff. 
“Get on — there’s not much time ,” said Harry, gripping Buck-
beak firmly on either side of his sleek neck to hold him steady. 
“You’ve got to get out of here — the dementors are coming — 
Macnair’s gone to get them.” 
Black placed a hand on either side of the window frame and 
heaved his head and shoulders out of it. It was very lucky he was so 
thin. In seconds, he had managed to fling one leg over Buckbeak’s 
back and pull himsel f onto the hippogrif f behind Hermione. 
 
HERMIONE’S SECRET 
 415  “Okay, Buckbeak, up!” said Harry, shaking the rope. “Up to the 
tower — come on!” 
The hippogriff gave one sweep of its mighty wings and they were 
soaring upward again, high as the top of the West Tower. Buckbeak 
landed with a clatte r on the battlements, and Harry and Hermione 
slid off him at once. 
“Sirius, you’d better go, quick, ” Harry panted. “They’ll reach 
Flitwick’s office any moment, th ey’ll find out you’re gone.” 
Buckbeak pawed the ground , tossing his sharp head. 
“What happened to the other boy? Ron?” croaked Sirius. 
“He’s going to be okay. He’s still out of it, but Madam Pomfrey 
says she’ll be able to make him better. Quick — go —” 
But Black was still staring down at Harry. 
“How can I ever thank —” 
“GO!” Harry and Hermione shouted together. 
Black wheeled Buckbeak around, facing the open sky. “We’ll see each other again,” he said. “You are — truly your fa-
ther’s son, Harry. . . .” 
He squeezed Buckbeak’s sides with his heels. Harry and Hermione 
jumped back as the enormous wing s rose once more. . . . The hip-
pogriff took off into the air. . . . He and his rider became smaller and smaller as Harry gazed after them . . . then a cloud drifted 
across the moon. . . . They were gone.

Hermione was tugging at his sleeve, staring at her 
watch. “We’ve got exactly ten minutes to get back down to the hos-pital wing without anybody seeing us — before Dumbledore locks the door —” 
“Okay,” said Harry, wrenching his gaze from the sky, “let’s go. . . .” 
They slipped through the doorway behind them and down a 
tightly spiraling stone staircase. As they reached the bottom of it, 
they heard voices. They flattened themselves against the wall and 
listened. It sounded like Fudge and Snape. They were walking 
quickly along the corr idor at the foot of the staircase. 
“. . . only hope Dumbledore’s not going to make difficulties,” 
Snape was saying. “The Kiss will be performed immediately?” 
“As soon as Macnair returns wi th the dementors. This whole 
Black affair has been highly emba rrassing. I can’t tell you how

 417  much I’m looking forward to informing the Daily Prophet that 
we’ve got him at last. . . . I daresay they’ll want to interview you, 
Snape . . . and once young Harry’s back in his right mind, I expect he’ll want to tell the Prophet exactly how you saved him. . . .” 
Harry clenched his teeth. He ca ught a glimpse of Snape’s smirk 
as he and Fudge passed Harry an d Hermione’s hiding place. Their 
footsteps died away. Harry and Hermione waited a few moments 
to make sure they’d really gone, then started to run in the opposite 
direction. Down one staircas e, then another, along a new 
corridor — then they heard a cackling ahead. 
“Peeves !” Harry muttered, grabbing Hermione’s wrist. “In here!” 
They tore into a deserted classroom to their left just in time. 
Peeves seemed to be bouncing al ong the corridor in boisterous 
good spirits, laughi ng his head off. 
“Oh, he’s horrible,” whispered He rmione, her ear to the door. “I 
bet he’s all excited because the dementors are going to finish off Sirius. . . .” She checked her watch. “Three minutes, Harry!” 
They waited until Peeves’s gloating voice had faded into the dis-
tance, then slid back out of the room and broke into a run again. 
“Hermione — what’ll happen — if we don’t get back inside — 
before Dumbledore locks the door?” Harry panted. 
“I don’t want to think about it!” Hermione moaned, checking 
her watch again. “One minute!” 
They had reached the end of the corridor with the hospital wing 
entrance. “Okay — I can hear Dumbledore,” said Hermione 
tensely. “Come on, Harry!” 
They crept along the corridor . The door opened. Dumbledore’s 
back appeared. 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 418  “I am going to lock you in,” they heard him saying. “It is five 
minutes to midnight. Miss Granger, three turns should do it. Good 
luck.” 
Dumbledore backed out of the ro om, closed the door, and took 
out his wand to magically lock it. Panicking, Harry and Hermione 
ran forward. Dumbledore looked up, and a wide smile appeared 
under the long silver mustache . “Well?” he said quietly. 
“We did it!” said Harry breathlessly. “Sirius has gone, on Buck-
beak. . . .” 
Dumbledore beamed at them. 
“Well done. I think —” He li stened intently for any sound 
within the hospital wi ng. “Yes, I think you’ve gone too — get in-
side — I’ll lo ck you in —” 
Harry and Hermione slipped back inside the dor mitory. It was 
empty except for Ron, who was st ill lying motionless in the end 
bed. As the lock clicked behind them, Harry and Hermione crept 
back to their own beds, Hermione tucking the Time-Turner back 
under her robes. A moment later, Madam Pomfrey came striding 
back out of her office. 
“Did I hear the headmaster leavin g? Am I allowed to look after 
my patients now?” 
She was in a very bad mood. Harry and Hermione thought it 
best to accept their chocolate quietly. Ma dam Pomfrey stood over 
them, making sure they ate it. Bu t Harry could hardly swallow. He 
and Hermione were wait ing, listening, their nerves jangling. . . . 
And then, as they both took a fourth piece of chocolate from 
Madam Pomfrey, they heard a dist ant roar of fury echoing from 
somewhere above them. . . . 
“What was that?” said Ma dam Pomfrey in alarm. 
OWL POST AGAIN 
 419  Now they could hear angry voices, growing louder and louder. 
Madam Pomfrey was staring at the door. 
“Really — they’ll wake everybody up! What do they think 
they’re doing?” 
Harry was trying to hear what the voices were saying. They were 
drawing nearer — 
“He must have Disapparated, Se verus. We should have left 
somebody in the room with him. When this gets out —” 
“HE DIDN’T DISAPPARATE!” Sn ape roared, now very close 
at hand. “YOU CAN’T APPARATE OR DISAPPARATE IN-
SIDE THIS CASTLE! THIS — HAS — SOMETHING — TO — 
DO — WITH — POTTER!” 
“Severus — be reasonable — Ha rry has been locked up —” 
BAM. 
The door of the hospit al wing burst open. 
Fudge, Snape, and Dumbledore ca me striding into the ward. 
Dumbledore alone looked calm. Inde ed, he looked as though he 
was quite enjoying himself. Fudge appeared angry. But Snape was 
beside himself. 
“OUT WITH IT, POTTER!” he bellowed. “WHAT DID 
YOU DO?” 
“Professor Snape!” shrieked Ma dam Pomfrey. “Control your-
self!” 
“See here, Snape, be reasonable,” said Fudge. “This door’s been 
locked, we just saw —” 
“THEY HELPED HIM ESCAPE, I KNOW IT!” Snape 
howled, pointing at Harry and He rmione. His face was twisted; 
spit was flying from his mouth. 
“Calm down, man!” Fudge barked. “You’re talking nonsense!” 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 420  “YOU DON’T KNOW POTTER!” shrieked Snape. “HE DID 
IT, I KNOW HE DID IT —” 
“That will do, Severus,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Think about 
what you are saying. This door has be en locked since I left the ward 
ten minutes ago. Madam Pomfrey, have these students left their 
beds?” 
“Of course not!” said Madam Pomf rey, bristling. “I would have 
heard them!” 
“Well, there you have it, Seve rus,” said Dumbledore calmly. 
“Unless you are suggesting that Harry and Hermione are able to be 
in two places at once, I’m afraid I don’t see any point in troubling 
them further.” 
Snape stood there, seething, star ing from Fudge, who looked 
thoroughly shocked at his behavi or, to Dumbledore, whose eyes 
were twinkling behind his glasses. Snape whirled about, robes swishing behind him, and stormed out of the ward. 
“Fellow seems quite unbalanced,” said Fudge, staring after him. 
“I’d watch out for him if I were you, Dumbledore.” 
“Oh, he’s not unbalanced,” said Dumbledore quietly. “He’s just 
suffered a severe disappointment.” 
“He’s not the only one!” puffed Fudge. “The Daily Prophet’s go-
ing to have a field day! We ha d Black cornered and he slipped 
through our fingers yet again! All it needs no w is for the story of 
that hippogriff’s escape to get out, and I’ll be a laughingstock! Well . . . I’d better go and notify the Mini stry. . . .” 
“And the dementors?” said Dumb ledore. “They’ll be removed 
from the school, I trust?” 
“Oh yes, they’ll have to go,” said Fudge, running his fingers

 421  distractedly through his hair. “Nev er dreamed they’d attempt to ad-
minister the Kiss on an innocent boy. . . . Completely out of con-
trol . . . no, I’ll have them packed off back to Azkaban tonight. . . . 
Perhaps we should think about dragons at the sc hool entrance. . . .” 
“Hagrid would like th at,” said Dumbledore, smiling at Harry 
and Hermione. As he and Fudge left the dormitory, Madam Pom-
frey hurried to the door and locked it again. Muttering angrily to 
herself, she headed back to her office. 
There was a low moan from the other end of the ward. Ron had 
woken up. They could see him sitt ing up, rubbing his head, look-
ing around. 
“What — what happened?” he gr oaned. “Harry? Why are we in 
here? Where’s Sirius? Where’s Lupin? What’s going on?” 
Harry and Hermione look ed at each other. 
“You explain,” said Harry, helpin g himself to some more choco-
late. 
 
When Harry, Ron, and Hermione left the hospital wing at noo n 
the next day, it was to find an almost deserted castle. The swelter-
ing heat and the end of the exams meant that everyone was taking 
full advantage of another Hogsmeade visit. Neither Ron nor 
Hermione felt like going, howeve r, so they and Harry wandered 
onto the grounds, still talking about the extraordinary events of the 
previous night and wondering wh ere Sirius and Buckbeak were 
now. Sitting near the lake, watching the giant squid waving its ten-
tacles lazily above the water, Harry lost the th read of the conversa-
tion as he looked across to th e opposite bank. The stag had 
galloped toward him from th ere just last night. . . . 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 422  A shadow fell across them and they looked up to see a very 
bleary-eyed Hagrid, mopping his swea ty face with one of his table-
cloth-sized handkerchiefs and beaming dow n at them. 
“Know I shouldn’ feel happy, after wha’ happened las’ night,” he 
said. “I mean, Black escapin’ again, an’ everythin’ — but guess 
what?” 
“What?” they said, pretending to look curious. 
“Beaky! He escaped! He’s free! Bin celebratin’ all night!” 
“That’s wonderful!” said Hermione, giving Ron a reproving look 
because he looked as though he was close to laughing. 
“Yeah . . . can’t’ve tied him up properly,” said Hagrid, gazing 
happily out over the grounds. “I was worried this mornin’, 
mind . . . thought he mighta met Professor Lupin on the grounds, 
but Lupin says he never ate anythin’ las’ night. . . .” 
“What?” said Harry quickly. “Blimey, haven’ yeh heard?” said Hagrid, his smile fading a little. 
He lowered his voice, even though there was nobody in sight. 
“Er — Snape told all th e Slytherins this mo rnin’. . . . Thought 
everyone’d know by now . . . Pro fessor Lupin’s a we rewolf, see. An’ 
he was loose on the grounds las’ ni ght. . . . He’s packin’ now, o’ 
course.” 
“He’s packing ?” said Harry, alarmed. “Why?” 
“Leavin’, isn’ he?” said Hagrid , looking surprised that Harry had 
to ask. “Resigned firs’ thing this mo rnin’. Says he can’t risk it hap-
penin’ again.” 
Harry scrambled to his feet. 
“I’m going to see him,” he said to Ron and Hermione. “But if he’s resigned —” 
 
OWL POST AGAIN 
 423  “— doesn’t sound like ther e’s anything we can do —” 
“I don’t care. I still want to se e him. I’ll meet you back here.” 
 
Lupin’s office door was open. He had already packed most of his 
things. The grindylow’s empty tank stood next to his battered old 
suitcase, which was open and nearly full. Lupin was bending over 
something on his desk and looked up only when Harry knocked 
on the door. 
“I saw you coming,” said Lupin, smiling. He pointed to the 
parchment he had been poring over. It was the Marauder’s Map. 
“I just saw Hagrid,” said Harry. “And he said you’d resigned. It’s 
not true, is it?” 
“I’m afraid it is,” said Lupin. He started opening his desk draw-
ers and taking out the contents. 
“Why?” said Harry. “The Minist ry of Magic don’t think you 
were helping Sirius, do they?” 
Lupin crossed to the door an d closed it behind Harry. 
“No. Professor Dumbledore managed to convince Fudge that I 
was trying to save your lives.” He sighed. “That was the final straw 
for Severus. I think the loss of the Order of Merlin hit him hard. So 
he — er — accidentally let slip that I am a werewolf this morning 
at breakfast.” 
“You’re not leaving just beca use of that!” said Harry. 
Lupin smiled wryly. 
“This time tomorrow, the owls will start arriving from par-
ents. . . . They will not want a we rewolf teaching their children, 
Harry. And after last night, I see their point. I could have bitten 
any of you. . . . That mu st never happen again.” 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 424  “You’re the best Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher we’ve 
ever had!” said Harry. “Don’t go!” 
Lupin shook his head and didn’t speak. He carried on emptying 
his drawers. Then, while Harry was trying to think of a good argu-
ment to make him stay, Lupin said, “From what the headmaster 
told me this morning, you saved a lot of lives last night, Harry. If 
I’m proud of anything I’ve done this year, it’s how much you’ve 
learned. . . . Tell me about your Patronus.” 
“How d’you know about that?” said Harry, distracted. 
“What else could have driv en the dementors back?” 
Harry told Lupin what had happened. When he’d finished, 
Lupin was smiling again. 
“Yes, your father was always a s t a g w h e n h e t r ansformed,” he 
said. “You guessed righ t . . . that’s why we called him Prongs.” 
Lupin threw his last few books into his case, closed the desk 
drawers, and turned to look at Harry. 
“Here — I brought this from the Shrieking Shack last night,” he 
said, handing Harry back the Invisibi lity Cloak. “And . . .” He hes-
itated, then held out the Marauder’s Map too. “I am no longer your 
teacher, so I don’t feel guilty about giving you back this as well. It’s 
no use to me, and I daresay you, Ro n, and Hermione will find uses 
for it.” 
Harry took the map and grinned. 
“You told me Moony, Wormtail , Padfoot, and Prongs would’ve 
wanted to lure me out of school . . . you said they’d have thought it 
was funny.” 
“ A n d s o w e w o u l d h a v e , ” s a i d L u p i n , n o w r e a c h i n g d o w n t o

cret passages out of the castle.” 
There was a knock on the door. Harry hastily stuffed the Ma-
rauder’s Map and the Invisibi lity Cloak into his pocket. 
It was Professor Dumbledore. He didn’t look surprised to see 
Harry there. 
“Your carriage is at the gates, Remus,” he said. 
“Thank you, Headmaster.” 
Lupin picked up his old suitcase and the empty grindylow tank. 
“Well — good-bye, Harry,” he said, smiling. “It has been a 
real pleasure teaching you. I feel sure we’ll meet again some-
time. Headmaster, there is no need to see me to the gates, I can 
manage. . . .” 
Harry had the impression that Lupi n wanted to leave as quickly 
as possible. 
“Good-bye, then, Remus,” said Dumbledore soberly. Lupin 
shifted the grindylow tank slight ly so that he and Dumbledore 
could shake hands. Then, with a final nod to Harry and a swift 
smile, Lupin le ft the office. 
Harry sat down in his vacated chai r, staring glumly at the floor. 
He heard the door close and looked up. Dumbledore was still there. 
“Why so miserable, Harry?” he said quietly. “You should be very 
proud of yourself after last night.” 
“It didn’t make any difference,” sa id Harry bitterly. “Pettigrew 
got away.” 
“Didn’t make any difference?” said Dumbledore quietly. “It 
made all the difference in the world, Harry. You helped uncover the 
truth. You saved an innocent man from a terrible fate.” 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 426  Terrible. Something stirred in Harry’s memory. Greater and more 
terrible than ever before . . . Professor Trelawney’s prediction! 
“Professor Dumbledore — yesterday, when I was having my 
Divination exam, Professor Trelawney went very — very strange.” 
“Indeed?” said Dumbledore. “Er — stranger than usual, you 
mean?” 
“Yes . . . her voice went all d eep and her eyes rolled and she 
said . . . she said Voldemort’s servant was going to set out to return 
to him before midnight. . . . Sh e said the serv ant would help 
him come back to power.” Harry stared up at Dumbledore. “And then she sort of became normal again, and she couldn’t remem-
ber anything she’d said. Was it — was she making a real predic-
tion? 
Dumbledore looked mildly impressed. “Do you know, Harry, I think she might have been,” he said 
thoughtfully. “Who’d have thought it ? That brings her total of real 
predictions up to two. I should offer her a pay raise. . . .” 
“But —” Harry looked at him, aghast. How could Dumbledore 
take this so calmly? 
“But — I stopped Sirius and Professor Lupin from killing Petti-
grew! That makes it my faul t if Voldemort comes back!” 
“It does not,” said Dumbledore quietly. “Hasn’t your experience 
with the Time-Turner taught you anything, Harry? The conse-
quences of our actions are always so complicated, so diverse, that 
predicting the future is a very diff icult business indeed. . . . Profes-
sor Trelawney, bless her, is living proof of that. . . . You did a very noble thing, in saving Pettigrew’s life.” 
“But if he helps Voldem ort back to power — !” 
 
OWL POST AGAIN 
 427  “Pettigrew owes his life to yo u. You have sent Voldemort a 
deputy who is in your debt. . . . When one wizard saves another 
wizard’s life, it creates a certai n bond between them . . . and I’m 
much mistaken if Voldemort wants his servant in the debt of Harry 
Potter.” 
“I don’t want a connection with Pettigrew!” said Harry. “He be-
trayed my parents!” 
“This is magic at its deepest, it s most impenetrable, Harry. But 
trust me . . . the time may come when you will be very glad you 
saved Pettigrew’s life.” 
Harry couldn’t imagine when that would be. Dumbledore 
looked as though he knew what Harry was thinking. 
“I knew your father very well, both at Hogwarts and later, 
Harry,” he said gently. “He would have saved Pettigrew too, I am 
sure of it.” 
Harry looked up at him. Dumbledore wouldn’t laugh — he 
could tell Dumbledore . . . 
“I thought it was my dad who’d conjured my Patronus. I mean, 
when I saw myself across the lake . . . I thought I was seeing him.” 
“An easy mistake to ma ke,” said Dumbledore softly. “I expect 
you’ll tire of hearing it, but you do look extraordinarily like James. 
Except for the eyes . . . you have your mother’s eyes.” 
Harry shook his head. 
“It was stupid, thinking it was him,” he muttered. “I mean, I 
knew he was dead.” 
“You think the dead we loved ever truly leave us? You think that 
we don’t recall them more clearly than ever in times of great trou-ble? Your father is alive in you, Harry, and shows himself most 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 428  plainly when you have need of hi m. How else could you produce 
that particular Patronus? Prongs rode again last night.” 
It took a moment for Harry to realize what Dumbledore had 
said. 
“Last night Sirius told me all about how they became Animagi,” 
said Dumbledore, smiling. “An extraordinary achievement — not 
least, keeping it quiet from me. And then I remembered the most 
unusual form your Patronus to ok, when it charged Mr. Malfoy 
down at your Quidditch match against Ravenclaw. You know, 
Harry, in a way, you did see your fa ther last night. . . . You found 
him inside yourself.” 
And Dumbledore left the office, leaving Harry to his very con-
fused thoughts. 
 
Nobody at Hogwarts now knew th e truth of what had happened 
the night that Sirius, Buckbeak, an d Pettigrew had va nished except 
Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Professor Dumbledore. As the end of term approached, Harry heard many different theories about what 
had really happen ed, but none of them came close to the truth. 
Malfoy was furious about Buck beak. He was convinced that 
Hagrid had found a way of smuggl ing the hippogriff to safety, and 
seemed outraged that he and his father had been outwitted by a 
gamekeeper. Percy Weas ley, meanwhile, had much to say on the 
subject of Sirius’s escape. 
“If I manage to get into the Ministry, I’ll have a lot of proposals 
to make about Magical Law Enforcem ent!” he told the only person 
who would listen — his girlfriend, Penelope. 
Though the weather was perfect, though the atmosphere was so 
 
OWL POST AGAIN 
 429  cheerful, though he knew they had achieved the near impossible in 
helping Sirius to freedom, Harry had never approached the end of 
a school year in worse spirits. 
He certainly wasn’t the only on e who was sorry to see Professor 
Lupin go. The whole of Harry’s Defense Against the Dark Arts class was miserable about his resignation. 
“Wonder what they’ll give us next year?” said Seamus Finnigan 
gloomily. 
“Maybe a vampire,” suggested Dean Thomas hopefully. 
I t w a s n ’ t o n l y P r o f e s s o r L u p i n ’ s departure that was weighing on 
Harry’s mind. He couldn’t help thinking a lot about Professor 
Trelawney’s prediction. He kept wo ndering where Pettigrew was now, 
whether he had sought sanctuary wi th Voldemort yet. But the thing 
that was lowering Harry’s spirits mo st of all was the prospect of re-
turning to the Dursleys. For maybe ha lf an hour, a glorious half hour, 
he had believed he would be living with Sirius from now on . . . his 
parents’ best friend. . . . It would have been the next best thing to hav-
ing his own father back. And while no news of Sirius was definitely 
good news, because it meant he had successfully gone into hiding, 
Harry couldn’t help feel ing miserable when he thought of the home 
he might have had, and the fact that it was now impossible. 
The exam results came out on the last day of term. Harry, Ron, 
and Hermione had passed every subjec t. Harry was amazed that he 
had got through Potions. He had a shrewd suspicion that Dumble-
dore might have stepped in to stop Snape failing him on purpose. 
Snape’s behavior toward Harry over the past week had been quite 
alarming. Harry wouldn’t have th ought it possible that Snape’s 
dislike for him could increase, bu t it certainly had. A muscle 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 430  twitched unpleasantly at the corner of Snape’s thin mouth every 
time he looked at Harry, and he was constantly flexing his fingers, 
as though itching to place them around Harry’s throat. 
Percy had got his top-grade N.E.W.T.s; Fred and George had 
scraped a handful of O.W.L.s each . Gryffindor House, meanwhile, 
largely thanks to their spectacular performance in the Quidditch 
Cup, had won the House championship for the third year running. 
This meant that the end of term feast took place amid decorations 
of scarlet and gold, and that the Gr yffindor table was the noisiest of 
the lot, as everybody celebrated. Even Harry managed to forget about the journey back to the Durs leys the next day as he ate, 
drank, talked, and la ughed with the rest. 
 
As the Hogwarts Express pulled ou t of the station the next morn-
ing, Hermione gave Harry and Ron some surprising news. 
“I went to see Professor McGonagall this morning, just before 
breakfast. I’ve decided to drop Muggle Studies.” 
“But you passed your exam with three hundred and twenty per-
cent!” said Ron. 
“I know,” sighed Hermione, “but I can’t stand another year like 
this one. That Time-Turner, it was driving me mad. I’ve handed it in. Without Muggle Studies and Divi nation, I’ll be able to have a 
normal schedule again.” 
“I still can’t believe you didn’t tell us about it,” said Ron 
grumpily. “We’re supp osed to be your friends. ” 
“I promised I wouldn’t tell anyone, ” said Hermione severely. She 
looked around at Harry, who wa s watching Hogwarts disappear 
from view behind a mo untain. Two whole mont hs before he’d see 
it again. . . . 
OWL POST AGAIN 
 431  “Oh, cheer up, Harry!” said Hermione sadly. 
“I’m okay,” said Harry quickly. “Just thinking about the holi-
days.” 
“Yeah, I’ve been thinking about them too,” said Ron. “Harry, 
you’ve got to come and stay with us. I’ll fix it up with Mum and 
Dad, then I’ll call yo u. I know how to use a fellytone now —” 
“A telephone, Ron,” said Hermione. “Honestly, you should take 
Muggle Studies next year. . . .” 
Ron ignored her. “It’s the Quidditch World Cup this summer! How about it, 
Harry? Come and stay, and we’ll go and see it! Dad can usually get 
tickets from work.” 
This proposal had the effect of cheering Harry up a great deal. 
“Yeah . . . I bet the Dursleys’d be pleased to let me come . . . 
especially after what I di d to Aunt Ma rge. . . .” 
Feeling considerably more ch eerful, Harry joined Ron and 
Hermione in several games of Ex ploding Snap, and when the witch 
with the tea cart arrived, he bo ught himself a very large lunch, 
though nothing with chocolate in it. 
But it was late in the afternoon before the thing that made him 
truly happy turned up. . . . 
“Harry,” said Hermione suddenly, peering over his shoulder. 
“What’s that thing outside your window?” 
Harry turned to look outside. Something very small and gray 
was bobbing in and out of sight beyond the glass. He stood up for 
a better look and saw that it was a tiny owl, carrying a letter that 
was much too big for it. The owl was so small, in fact , that it kept 
tumbling over in the air, buffeted this way and that in the train’s 
slipstream. Harry quic kly pulled down the wi ndow, stretched out 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 432  his arm, and caught it. It felt like a very fl uffy Snitch. He brought 
it carefully inside. The owl drop ped its letter onto Harry’s seat 
and began zooming around their compartment, apparently very 
pleased with itself for accomplis hing its task. Hedwig clicked her 
beak with a sort of dignified disapproval. Crookshanks sat up in his seat, following the owl with his gr eat yellow eyes. Ron, noticing 
this, snatched the owl safely out of harm’s way. 
Harry picked up the letter. It was addressed to him. He ripped 
open the letter, and shoute d, “It’s from Sirius!” 
“What?” said Ron and Hermione excitedly. “Read it aloud!” 
 
Dear Harry, 
I hope this finds you before you reach your aunt and uncle. 
I don’t know whether they’re used to owl post. 
Buckbeak and I are in hiding . I won’t tell you where, in 
case this owl falls into the wrong hands. I have some doubt 
about his reliability, but he is the best I could find, and he did 
seem eager for the job. 
I believe the dementors are still searching for me, but they 
haven’t a hope of finding me here . I am planning to allow some 
Muggles to glimpse me soon, a long way from Hogwarts, so 
that the security on th e castle will be lifted. 
There is something I never got around to telling you 
during our brief meeting. It was I who sent you the Fire-
bolt — 
 
“Ha!” said Hermione triumphantly. “See! I told you it was from 
him!” 
OWL POST AGAIN 
 433  “Yes, but he hadn’t jinxed it, had he?” said Ron. “Ouch!” The 
tiny owl, now hooting happily in his hand, had nibbled one of his 
fingers in what it se emed to think was an affectionate way. 
 
Crookshanks took the order to the Owl Office for me. I used 
your name but told them to take the gold from my own 
Gringotts vault. Please consider it as thirteen birthdays’ worth of presents from your godfather. 
I would also like to apologize for the fright I think I gave 
you that night last year when yo u left your uncle’s house. I had 
only hoped to get a glimpse of you before starting my journey north, but I think the sight of me alarmed you. 
I am enclosing something else for you, which I think will 
make your next year at Hogwarts more enjoyable. 
If ever you need me, send word. Your owl will find me. 
I’ll write again soon. 
Sirius 
 
Harry looked eagerly inside th e envelope. There was another 
piece of parchment in there. He read it through quickly and felt 
suddenly as warm and contented as though he’d swallowed a bottle 
of hot butterbeer in one gulp. 
 
I, Sirius Black, Harry Potter’s godfather, hereby give him 
permission to visit Hogsmeade on weekends. 
 
“That’ll be good enough for Dumbledore!” said Harry happily. 
He looked back at Sirius’s letter. 
 
CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 
 434  “Hang on, there’s a P.S. . . .” 
 
I thought your friend Ron might li ke to keep this owl, as it’s 
my fault he no longer has a rat. 
 Ron’s eyes widened. The minute owl was still hooting excitedly. 
“Keep him?” he said uncertainly. He looked closely at the owl 
for a moment; then, to Harry’s an d Hermione’s great surprise, he 
held him out for Crookshanks to sniff. 
“What do’you reckon?” Ron asked the cat. “Definitely an owl?” 
Crookshanks purred. 
“That’s good enough for me,” sa id Ron happily. “He’s mine.” 
Harry read and reread the letter from Sirius all the way back into 
King’s Cross station. It was still cl utched tightly in his hand as he, 
Ron, and Hermione stepped back through the barrier of platform 
nine and three-quarters. Harry spo tted Uncle Vernon at once. He 
was standing a good dist ance from Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, eyeing 
them suspiciously, and when Mrs. Weasley hugged Harry in greet-
ing, his worst suspicions about them seemed confirmed. 
“I’ll call about the World Cup! ” Ron yelled after Harry as Harry 
bid him and Hermione good-bye, then wheeled the trolley bearing 
his trunk and Hedwig’s cage to ward Uncle Vernon, who greeted 
him in his usual fashion. 
“What’s that?” he snarled, starin g at the envelope Harry was still 
clutching in his hand. “If it’s anot her form for me to sign, you’ve 
got another —” 
“It’s not,” said Harry cheerfully. “I t’s a letter from my godfather.” 
“Godfather?” sputtered Uncle Vernon. “You haven’t got a god-
father!”

 435  “Yes, I have,” said Harry brightly. “He was my mum and dad’s 
best friend. He’s a convicted murd erer, but he’s broken out of wiz-
ard prison and he’s on the run. He likes to keep in touch with me, 
though . . . keep up wi th my news . . . check if I’m happy. . . .” 
And, grinning broadly at the l ook of horror on Uncle Vernon’s 
face, Harry set off toward the statio n exit, Hedwig rattling along in 
front of him, for what looked like a much better summer than 
the last.
